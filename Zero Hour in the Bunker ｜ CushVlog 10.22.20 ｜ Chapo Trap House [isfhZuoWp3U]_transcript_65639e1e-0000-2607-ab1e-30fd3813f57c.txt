 I am the man who will fight for your honor, I'll be the hero that you're dreaming of, let me forever, make me eat leather and do awesome sandwich fighting. with you, what the fuck happened? did i get cut off again? does this sometimes? shit, oh wait a minute, there it is, like a night and shining armor from a long time ago, oh no, i thought i had the mute on, didn't, now i do, muted is on, are you ready for some debate? hates thursday night party, we got Frank and el and steve, it's going to be a big party, i am so excited about this debate honestly, specifically how Trump is going to respond to being COVID ruined and gacked up and also clearly in a death spiral where he is at some level aware of his position even though he denies it. which means he might be completely buck wild in this thing and apparently they're going to try to actually mute him, very interested to see how that actually plays out, and if there's any willingness or or uh on the part of the moderators to really try to rain him in if he doesn't want to be rain in, but maybe they put him on the rino tranks to preserve the senate, they're like, oh god, we can't let him go out here like this, they just fucking take him down. and he like gets to half speed and he's doing like chopped and screwed Trump which is at least you know they can point to and say see he's not quite as erratic and manic and wild and seemingly uh on the verge of tears as he has been in every recent public appearance we'll see. i mean after that 60 minutes interview i mean my god the g the man is just a winy bitch it's kind of it's kind of amazing. but of course it doesn't matter, it's all just a fun, fun uh, spectacle, i think the race was probably decided on the fundamentals, i'm pogging, folks, i'm pogging, and don't we love to pog, don't we love pogging, but anyway, because i think it might be fun and because honestly i didn't feel like our contribution to the first debate really made it any funnier or more interesting because of just how how language broke down and it was just this symphony and it was like we were talking during a symphony uh i'm going to we're not going to be doing a chapo podcast related stream of the debate i believe alex lowan option will be uh doing it for fym on here and uh if you want to have like a chill you know friend to watch. with Alex will be very good, but I really just want to enjoy it, I just want to sit, now that I have had my breakthrough moment with the last debate, I want to sit with this one and just let it wash over me, like forget any attempt to to interrogate, the sentences or words for meaning, break them down, break them of context, turn them into just music and then just let it wave over me, which is what I kind of felt like I did during the town hall when they were competing streams i was... list to both of them and I was out of toggling back and forth and creating my own Pixy song, so that's going to be fun, but then when it's over, I think I and Christ and I don't who else, whoever wants to, will pop on to do some reacts, some hot reacts. I don't think we're going to get, we never got that sons debate, never made up for the loss debate by giving us the sons, it's tragic, he does seem to sound bad lately, I mean maybe that's people's wishful thinking, but it does seem like COVID has taken a little bit out of his sales, he seems to be kind of delired. Yes, when he isn't very raspy. I'm not sure all who will be in the post debate stream, I know I will be and I think Chris also, I hope Chris since he runs the runs the discord thing, yeah, the one way you know the Trump has either either thrown in the towel or just has lost his touch is that their big their big psychological move at the last debate which in 2016 was in the face of the planet uh the uh entertainment tonight tapes coming out and the grabbing by the pussy controversy in the teeth of that near days later he went out there and put all of a a he put a a chorus line of Bill Clinton's most prominent uh sexual assault um uh accusers and row, i mean absolute masterclass, this time it's uh some guy named Tony Bolony, some guy, that is the equivalent of when democrats would like epically talk about, oh my god, you know who left parnis new, that's right, if you're thinking it's flirtosh, it's flirtosh, okay, and that's the kind of stuff that nobody outside their screen, their area know, and they would scream across the void during the whole the the fucking... impeachment bullshit which lol can you imagine think of all the fucking energy these people put into that? even the people like the people who did it and the people watched and cheered about it and cared about it and got wrapped about it, think of that energy, do they not in their heart know that it was completely wasted, that it meant nothing, that it was just jacking off into an ocean, they don't get that at some point, i think some of them do, which is why they have to keep shreaking and creating more and more like insane hypothetical universes where their brand of uh of of pragmatic idealism is mildly relevant, so this would be like if in if if this would honestly be like if say Biden was, say covid hadn't happened right uh um and the economy like maybe it's maybe we're seeing it start to cool off a little bit which is what the the there were fundamentals that seemed to indicate that we were headed towards recession even before covid, so but maybe it's like it's not a huge drop and and then it's now that is honestly even if it started then that might be too early to really affect the election, like the reason george WH Bush lost in 1992 is largely because the little recession that happened at this end of his second term was in the exact right moment to just ripple out and and be maximally impacting people's uh minds uh the news and uh and their votes, which wouldn't necessarily have happened depending on how severe it was, but anyway, say we live in that world, and in the election, nothing's about COVID, and it's all about, you know, uh, probably about Trump being corrupt, and probably more Russia gate stuff, and let's and and impeachment stuff, and maybe and and and and like Trump is up by five going into election day at the national level, and the democrats are going insane, because how do people not get it, and their big kudag would be: to bring out like uh Stephen parsnip or one of the peop people that no one outside of the rachel b bubble mat uh Rachel Mado Bubble nose and put them in the front row to remind people about the Ukraine crimes or something that would be as out of touch and ridiculous as him bringing hunter Thompson Hunter Thompson Hunter Bydon's uh like a crime buddy no one gives a fuck and it just goes to show that you know you live by the sword, die by the sword in terms of uh, like that Trump in 2016 ran a campaign that was effective in part because Trump knew it the people wanted, because it was what he wanted, having watched the white, having watched Obama be president for eight years and having been personally infuriated by Obama and by democrats and liberalism in general as a result of his revoltion of Obama, he is able to articulate with perfect clarity the concerns of you, this this dispossessed lump and bourgeois we have in this country, and they and they were he was able to fix to Hillary Clinton, all of the the horrors of the last 40 years, not just social liberalism, but economic and neoliberalism, she was the avatar of all of it, and he was able to paint her in that way, and and her personal corruption was able to be put it, her, her husband's sexual license was able to neutralize any attacks on Trump's personal virtue, this time he's not, he's... spent the last four years, not outside of the presidency, he has literally been dictating the news that he's been watching, well everyone else is watching him and trying to identify with him. and what that means is that he is now no longer able to pitch himself to a broad spectrum of you know relatively uncommitted less than partisanly uh identified voters which is a lot of people and which a lot of like the dedicated partisans who make up the consumers of most political media have a hard time imagining but it's true and those are the people who make the decisions every fucking four years between one person winning and the other and also who decides to come out and vote who wouldn't have otherwise and none of that is getting none of them care about GlorP Simpson and Flitch doodleberg just like they didn't care about the the stuff with uh with Trump and the Russians, it's the exact same sort of epistemic uh black hole, it's the same uh bubble, which goes to show that like there really is no difference between these people, like even even Trump once he got into Hollywood, I mean sorry once he got into the white house just turned into another disc. connected holly uh uh Hollywood Hollywood Washington Cico, he he even as he fought against what he saw as a hostile culture, he he subconsciously absorbed all of their priors including that people care about stuff like who Hunter Thompson's Hunter Thompson Hunter Biden's uh uh co- criminal is as though as though like the Hillary Clinton thing had anything to do with the the content of the case like the emails themselves. It was with that represented about Hillary Clinton, and he could do that because he was challenging and incumbant, and now he is, he's the incumbant and it just, he never learned how to realize he was in power because he's just been watching the presidency for the past four years. I'm very interested to see what the uh, turnout ends up being, because you're seeing crazy numbers in early turnout in states like Texas and Geordia. now of course that doesn't necessarily me anything, we have no idea how many of these people are banking are how many of these are banked votes that would otherwise have come on election day, we have no way of knowing, but when you see how big it is compared to the number of votes that like we're in the last election, it's hard not to imagine that you, even if it's just a defect that because few people vote on election day, it's easier to vote on election day and more people who might be on the fence about voting will do it because it's less of a hassle, like even if that's the amount of effect it has, it could be a significant in terms of moving something from you know a a a a a clear elector uh uh popular vote victory, but then you know the the the the nightmare of litigation and all the swing states uh and a relatively anti-climactic biden victory, who knows? it's interesting. i keep saying hundred Thompson, i think it's because there's uh, he seems like the kind of guy. who has read Hunter Thompson and taken some of the wrong lessons from it. And I would say that the numbers of people voting is the thing that's more at this point interesting and dispositive uh than um the polls because obviously you can say the polls are wrong cuz they were wrong last time. You know, I mean I do think that that Biden has a big. more durable lead than Hillary did at the same point, I'm pretty sure that's true uh, but even if you say they're still fucking up and the methodologies still wrong, and even in assume it's in the same direction, uh, I think just the trend of the polling plus the reality of all these early voting, I mean if there is just if there's a high, there's two models here, there's a high turnout model and a low turnout model, Trump could win a low turnout model, in fact a low turnout model probably favors a Trump victory over a Biden. but Trump basically cannot win a high high turnout election because we know from the last 20 years what the GOP percentage of the vote is. Trump did not have any kind of big surge of support over previous republicans. what he did is he had support in some different areas that were crucial for the uh electoral map because they because of our fucking electoral college, but overall it was basically the same percentage, the thing is is that because of the electoral college, because of voter suppression and and uh and you know the explicit policy of the republican party wherever it's in power to to make it more difficult to vote as a as a party policy as is a matter of like platform uh importance and that they've been successful at that uh and means that they can win, but if there's a lot of people who vote, if even with those things people still vote for some reason or another, they're motivated to, that would swap it, like Hillary lost because the... share a vote that went away from her in terms of people not voting in the right states and a few of them shifting from Obama to Trump, but mostly just not bothering to show up in the crucial states, those people likely are not going to come out to vote for Trump, because those are not really politicized people, which means I don't think they're looking at the fucking coronavirus and saying, well you know it's all China's fault and uh fake news, because they don't if they accepted his premise, they would already be on board, you know what I mean? now there is a theory that says that Q and on style. shit and like the dissolving nature of reality and the way that we have totally just like stepped through the looking glass in terms of living within a spectacle that maybe all of our understanding of like incentive structure and voting has been annihilated by our collective break, nervous breakdown in the face of this overwhelming sea of information that cannot be traversed with any kind of certainty that we basically have to drive ourselves insane and create fantastic uh uh uh like... uh rituals to charge sacred objects with power in order to scry meaning out of the darkness and chaos of online and in the world around us and so that means that why people are going to vote for who they do is almost quantumly improbable to predict, in which case anything could fucking happen, and I am not ruling that out, as I have said, I'm not going to be surprised by any outcome. somebody ask was papio Daniel a precursor to Trump, I mean he's part of a tradition, you can trace Trump through a line of American political figures and papio Daniel would certainly be one of them, uh, Papio Daniel, of course the name of the uh governor in miss in Mississippi governor in oh brother warthou and he is the guy who has a old timey radio station that plays ads for his flower uh that's a real guy papio daniel but he was not governor of Mississippi uh with Texas uh and the thing is I think is and he was a guy who who was a had started off as a like door to door flower salesman and then become a flower wholesaler and then sponsored a TV show a radio station, a radio show, a radio program of old time of uh folk music uh, the and the papio daniel flower hour, and he became famous enough in Texas that he ran, I believe for governor and then for senator, and uh, he defeated Lindon Johnson in Lindon Johnson's first run for senate in 1940. uh 1942 or 1940 uh, i think it's 1940, um, and in that race he lost because both O'Daniel and Johnson had certain rotten burrows, like uh countries in Texas where the local uh justice of the peace essentially controlled the votes and could determine how many votes uh the respective candidates Scott and then just delivered them to the highest bitter basically, and they both had these these guys, these votes collected, and over the night as the votes came in, the legitimate votes and the illegitimate votes, they would let them out sort of as needed, and there was always a uh a staring contest about who would like release their votes last, because once you once the enemy had had released their last crooked votes, you knew then how many you needed, and that means you could go over the top. and that's what happened is that Johnson released his last countries prematurely because he felt like he had a big enough uh margin that he could just let him all out there to like flood it, but that gave Papio Daniels people the number that they had to beat and so they just scrolled it up and posted it and boom they won and so that's the environment that Texas politics was like when he ran in 46 would he finally did win the landslide uh the the election where he got that nickname for a just absolutely crooked completely stolen uh senatorial primary campaign against Coke Stevenson. That's a wild story. It's very uh that volume of the caro he's got there's one uh one of the early caro volumes about LBJ is just about that means of ascent basically uh and it's fascinating he's a little too easy. on Coke Stevenson who was an awful just reactionary political figure and would have just been worse in in office than uh Johnson but it's a fascinating like. minute by minute telling of it, and the funny thing is is what ended up determining the vote after this crooked election that had this hugely disputed outcome and like the fucking the texas ranger who killed Bonnie and Clyde had to have a showdown uh over the contents of a bank vault in in Duvall County, which is the crooked county that uh that Johnson had uh was part of the Johnson fiefdom and it ended up go being officiated by the net the democratic party because it was a democratic party primary and the democratic party at the end of the day was full of new dealers who wanted to see the new deal went succeed and Coke Stevenson was anti new deal so they picked Johnson and the funny thing is that's the right decision that's the correct decision if you're there that's the correct decision and if you don't understand that it's because you believe these institutions serve any reason that other than the pursuit of power and that respecting them is going to save you from capital deciding to change the rules whenever it serves them to fuck you over and the thing is you can't even say oh no you're you know you're you're defaming the sanctity of the electoral process Stephenson stole votes too everyone was stealing votes it was not there was voter suppression was was systematized I mean Texas wasn't as bad as uh you know the deep south and in texas uh a lot of the times what you had instead of outright voter uh uh repression is that you had like urban machines like in Houston uh uh like black vote was like a block that could be purchased which in terms of you know actual uh you know franchise isn't much better than not being able to vote because you know the reason you're up you're being bought well like what's buying you is just pure money in the form of like connections through the uh political machine. uh not actual benefits to anybody uh are making the votes, not like the old you graft or at least not as not as uh beneficiently because you can never really vote against the racial apartide that you live under, but anyway that's an interesting story. and that's the yeah it definitely showed uh what Johnson was capable of holy fuck you mean he was like so there's so many points in his life story where it's he absolutely should not have gone on not just that he brew up super poor i mean that's the thing that fired him and it was the engine of his his ambition so he that was necessary that's origin story shit but throughout his life like his uh he took a bunch of insane risks and like that that senate seat was insanely a huge long shot to begin with, because Koke Stevenson was fucking beloved, he'd been a former like three-term governor, everybody loved him, in fact and it was like a cinsanatus thing where he had gone back to his ranch and they basically had to coax him out of retirement to come save the democratic party in in uh Texas and he was and and Johnson was like some uh you know relatively young uh fresh relatively inexperienced congressman. uh in a giant state like Texas who had almost none of the name recognition and he had to he like used all this money to do insanely innovative stuff he had a helicopter he campaigned under with going around uh Texas a fucking helicopter bought a ton of uh like uh radio ads and like you know just to get his name out there and then had also to just steal a ton of vallets just make a bunch of fake votes to get to be able to to even compete for it and like that was while he was having some sort of horrible like gallbladder problem like he almost died every big point of of of real stress in in Johnson's life and like when he felt like it was slipping away he would go into some sort of like bad uh serious health decline sometimes related to like gull stones or stomach problems he had a ton of heart attacks like in in moments of real stress he would essentially almost die but then he would will himself back. life and and to victory, the craziest one for me is that I mean unless it's unless you think he was in on the Kennedy assassination uh in which case it makes perfect sense, but if you buy any version of the Kennedy assassination that does not involve Johnson being aware of it, for him it was just blind luck, he was on the verge of having a career ending expos of his corrupt dealings as majority leader when he'd been in the senate, it was going to come out in I think life magazine, the day of... or after the Kennedy assass Kennedy was assassinated and was going to reveal his relationship to this guy Bobby Baker who was in who is like the head of the um like the interns in the senate uh and was running just a a massive graft and kickback operation that involved him getting kicking back up to Johnson and he had they had him dead to rights and then after Kennedy was assassinated they pulled the story and it never came back. I haven't. JFK and the unspeakable? I will be, because to me this book seems to be the thing that's got like the most important like rallying point for this new emerging, I've talked about consensus, where like Kennedy actually was killed by the deep state, the deep state does operate that way, and he was that much of a threat to it, after being fallow for a while, so I know this is a text I got to engage with, but uh, uh, I'm, it's on, it's on the list, I will read it shortly, I'm interested. I have read the devil's chessboard uh which is a fascinating book and it's great on dullaus but I think it's really interesting that for a book that's like pitch is is that it's trying to argue that Dullis was personally responsible for the Kennedy assassination is that as the book gets closer to the Kennedy assassination the figure of dullys recedes from the fucking story more and more and it becomes much more conjectural. which i mean if i'm putting up suspects uh for deep involvement in the Kennedy assassination like allen delis is up there with like learve oswald but i'm not sure i'm not convinced as all, i am not convinced by any theories of the Kennedy assassination, i would say that including the single bullet. I have read legacy of ashes which is very much you look at it especially now of the stuff that I didn't know when I read League of Ashes that I've discovered about the CIA sense that isn't in league of Legacy of Ashes, it's a jaw dropping feet of emission, I mean it's it's like the definition of a limited hangout, all the stuff in that's like outrageous in legacy of assess is all selectively uh threated. around the premise of greater uh organizational incompetence that makes the case that the CIA is essentially only able to waste money and shoot itself in the foot and has never been able to effectively do anything, which I think is is not an accurate representation of reality at all, and it's a perfect way to like get into the public consciousness, real crimes, but but always in that notion of, well that's that's was the past, we're working harder to serve you better. Oh uh, the Carol book that's about the 46th election is called means of ascent. Oh, if I went on dough boys, what chain restaurant would I pick? That's an interesting question. I'm going to assume that I'm I'm probably not going to be able to do anything for the first time, like they've probably been everywhere at least once, so I would have to be bringing them back somewhere. The easy answer would just be culvers, because that's Wisconsin's contribution to you, regional chain excellence, I think, but honestly I think I could probably have a more uh fruitful conversation and... more interesting conversation about arbies, man, i really want one of those heroes, i don't think there's an arbis in new york though, the arbies hero, not bad. somebody asked if uh if if they think that given is right to christianity ended the Roman empire and it wasn't gays, well it wasn't. obviously, but I'm not sure it was Christianity either, uh, I'm pretty sure it was something more uh firmly uh fixed than a religious enthusiasm, I mean a lot of me, I don't know that much honestly about the fall of Rome, I think that uh, like climate and uh, and uh, like agricultural yield has had something to do with it, I mean it wasn't that alone, but uh, so you had that contribution of you know uh of of an agricultural of of like intensifying agricultural crisis, and then you have you know just the unwieldliness of of an empire of the type that the roman empires tried to be, it was like it's it's fitting that a lot of the uh reforms of the like late. involved delegating responsibility away from a single emperor because of on how unviable it was. but yeah, that's a lot of stuff. Nothing like that can have one cause or even like a handful of causes, it's like a rope, it's like a, you know, you could pick out the strands, but no one strand is the strand, but yeah, anyone who says it's any one thing is wrong, and certainly gainus is the worst one, I remember Francis'. I think I saw Francis Shafer thing that made like the opposite of the gibben point but totally incoherently where he said uh the like the guy in later hose and did those 70s evangelical history and culture videos, I think I was propagandaized with those in my like uh high school history class when I was going to school in the middle of farm country in Wisconsin but he talked about how the the what doomed those societies was a finite worldview is how we put it. I remember at the time just thinking, what, what do you mean, I mean for and my main issue with that is that the Roman empire fell apart as it became Christian, wouldn't, wouldn't that have like prevented the collapse, the emergence of a christian, you know, ideology suffusing the empire, baffling, so yeah, no, if anyone's talking about single answers, that's they're just trying to get a rise out of people, the question is, the those strands are entwined, you know, like that's it's all just like documenting connections and and figuring out how mechanisms work as opposed to uh you know trying to sell a single patent explanation which is comes out of the sort of entrepreneurial nature of like academia sadly like novelty is rewarded you know so there's always a need to create uh schools of thought that require certain shibeleths and that lead you farther away from truth by pursuing it that way. I don't know, it's tough. I mean, I'm wrestling myself with how best to try to create narrative history that acknowledges you know the contingency of of chronological events, while still grounding everything. all those events in sort of the inevitable context that made them you, if not inevitable, sort of predetermined in some way, it's tough, but it's worth doing because I think it's the only way to communicate really just like how contingency works in history, and therefore like what, what, what matters now, and what needs to be focused on, yeah, we need a diacletian, that's for sure, and I don't think we got one, I don't think Joe Biden is. Jesse Ventura could have been diocletian, Jesse, you fucked up, you could have been diocletian, I am a shivel left, damn it. Who's the most cucked president? I mean, not in terms of uh, I wouldn't say in terms of politics or like sexuality, but just in terms of a guy you got own sort of pathetically. uh, William Howard Taff has got to be up there, so taft never really wanted to be president, he wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice, and he is essentially badgered into running for president by Teddy Roosevelt and his wife who really wanted to be first lady, and to please both of them, he ran for president, one, almost immediately his wife, was very much looking forward to being first lady, and living in the white house had a fucking debilitating stroke, he just win went out of the sales and he just sort of went through the... and then while he's being president, they helped like drag him into it is yelling at him and saying he's not good enough doing enough job and then challenges him for president and then runs against him and gets more votes and gets more electoral votes and becomes the last time one of the two major parties finished out of one or two in the electoral vote count and the popular vote count for that matter that's cucked but he uncucked himself by later finally getting the job that he dreamed of when they made him Supreme Court justice, which is a nice little, maybe he got owned so bad that they had to give him a consolation prize, and lucky for him, it's what he wanted all along, there's some sort of parable there that maybe he just should have you know listen to his heart, no no there should be any acid this evening now, I think I'll just uh I think I'll just chom a little bit. Who poops himself during the debate? Very good question. I got to think that with the COVID Trump has got to be Mr. Incontinent right now. will Trump have his mojo tonight? this is the question. all signs point to know, all signs point to his mojo having departed him, he seems low energy, his instincts are all off, he's talking about stuff nobody cares about, if he goes up there and talks about hunter bonnieton for an hour, he's going to lose and badly, but you know, the universe has a way of preventing uh the the shattering of uh of consensus reality in one motion like that, we like to just wear away at the edges of reality and not rind it asunder because I don't know that's i'm just trying to explain how in my gut I have a feeling that it'll be kind of lower energy, he will be less uh disruptive, he won't look like terrible shit and it'll kind of come off as a Trump win by being uh like low like... less of a circus and that's just like that's where my stomach is, it's like doesn't that feel right, having it be a real like Trump just wheezing like baron Harkon and like flemming up and yelling at about Tony Boloni in the front row and spewing like Gallager all over the place, I just can't see it happening, or Biden stroking out as funny as that would be, I don't see that happening either, just some, I don't know, maybe I've just uh i've run out of things to believe in, maybe i feel like i've gotten to the point of hypernormalization where even if that did happen, i wouldn't perceive it that way, i would perceive it like visserally as oh, just boring because i will have hypernormalized that quickly, i will be more normal than man. we'll find out though, i'm looking forward to it. someone asked uh enverjoja cringe or based? i would say that enver hoja is based cringe. I mean the bunkers are fucking cringe, I'm sorry, I will not be streaming the debate, Alex will be streaming the debate, I'm going to be watching at home and trying to let it wash over me, trying not to feel like I have. have a response to anything, that's i think what really trips me up, it's i find myself feeling like i need to have a a grab point to say something instead and that's going to make it harder for me to just wash over me, so my hope is to just just a symphony of sound, we will do a post game though, at least i and chris will be doing post game, chris might actually looks like Chris might be on the debate as well with Alex, so there you go, i might pop on, who knows? We'll see how it goes, but I'm going to start off not on there. Who's playing football tonight? uh somebody asks uh if I feel like chapo in general is more disenchanted with the system than it was in 2016 and I would say absolutely in the sense that we have had after 2016 I think all of us had a feeling. in that aftermath of that race and in the aftermath of Trump winning that there was a possibility to take the surprise bounty of the Sanders candidacy which arrayed all these forces that were opposed to the Clintons for whatever reason good and bad to rally around and that that could be the base board like a counter uh hegemonic like self-consciously class-oriented uh uh political block within the... democratic party that could sease control of its commanding heights and like reorient the party from there uh and whether or not that is theoretically possible as a strategy, i think some people would say, ah see, prove you wrong, i don't know if that's the case, i just know that the illusion that we have had been dissed from is the illusion that American politics in this year and the American electorate in this term and their relationship to voting and the relationship to the media and the relationship to the economy and the relationship, the the cultural like relationship of the classes to like the means of production and the means of cultural expression and the means and uh willingness to participate in electoral processes, they're all askew and they do not add up to a force that can be harnessed to that end, at least not now, i mean you could say that the campaign made me mistakes and I agree completely, people have been very upfront about a lot of tactical and strategic errors that the campaign made, bad hires, from bad hires to bad strategy to all bunch of stuff, but when I look at the results to me, it seems like there was an unmovable block of anti-Sanders uh uh conviction among somewhere around 55 to 60% of the... broad democratic primary electorate if you like think of that as a stable grouping, and the only way was going to overcome that was by energizing and engaging non-voters, non-participators in the democratic primary system, and that failed to happen, and you can talk about why, but I think fundamentally it's because there are there are missing belts, cultural conveyor belts between the political, the the the symbolic and and uh meaning orientation around politics and enough of the people you'd need to reach to switch to swing the demographics of these primary races, so yes i'd say like, but the thing is is that that's constructed because it tells you where you are, you know, it tells you what you what won't work, and it tells you what not to do again, and you got to move from there. and the thing is is that the democratic party now that they have now that now that the command of the neoliberal you know consensus has been has been is no longer challenged within it, they're going to govern as as monsters, it's going to be uh a a hunger chancellorship, and that like any crisis is also an opportunity or it needs to be, that's all I can say, I don't know if we'll be able to meet it. I don't know if we have the institutional flexibility or or capacity to meet the moment uh, I'm skeptical, but at the same time there's nothing else to do, so if enough people have that conviction then. Yeah, that's all you actually need, but hitting that number is is so hard because you never know what it is until afterwards, you'll never know what it was until after it's already happened. mad or cracked? you know this is funny, uh, i know crack became kind of a a a cringy uh radical centrist like lifestyle website, but back in the 90s. and 80's, it was a knockoff of mad magazine that i think was made by like former writers and editors for mad who left because mad wasn't paying them enough because william games was a fucking cheap skate and so they created an off-brand mad which that's the one that i could subscribe to, i did not subscribe to mad magazine, i subscribed to crack and i honestly can't tell you why, i guess one time i just picked up cracked and i like i read a thing i Maybe I saw some John Seven art because John Seven was a guy who wrote for years, he he did uh cartoons where he did comics for years for mad and then he left with the crack people to get more money and so he was in cracked and I really liked his drawing style and and otherwise it was basically the same material and I just I went to cracked I still respected mad magazine but I only had cracked delivered to my home. Cracked had a print version yes it was. a print magazine, it was originally an arrival for mad, it was like mad tv to mad, hilariously enough, it's like mad tv to mads snl, apparently people didn't know this, the children around here don't know this, the damn kids today, they don't know. Yeah, Sean Baby was very funny, Sean baby, early internet for the old heads in the chat, the the guys who invented a certain strain of web comedy, and of course that's why you can't really go back and read it without cringing, because everyone talks like that, now it's you know, it's like how just weeden for a while it was kind of funny and then it became monstrous. but it was good at the time, fat chicks and party hats is one of the funniest things i ever saw, i just cried reading that when i was a kid, thoughts on Charles Babbage, how are you gonna ask a motherfucker about Charles Bavage? You want to know my opinion on? the guy who fucking sketched out the difference engine, the a primitive computer, what what what opinion of tarol's bambage am i going to have? i don't understand, you just want to like see if i knew who he was, you people, you have very whacky answer questions sometimes. Somebody asked if chapo is based or cringe and I would say again we are based cringe, I read somebody asked about Neil Stevenson, I've only read snow crash and I his way of writing action kind of annoyed me over time so I never really read anything else. Someone wants my opinion on the pythagorean theorem. I really don't have one. I'm not even 100% sure what it is. A squared a squared plus b2 = c squared right? Am I voting? Yes, absolutely. I vote every time I can. I've only missed a few times. It's fun, I like it. I like the ritual. and I think there is something like in me like at a civil like at a civic level I actually do think you should vote like I think as someone who thinks ritual is important to reinforce behavior you know obviously voting has way way way too much psychic significance for people but it should have a little bit and so it should contribute a little bit so I I do vote, but like the thing is that's a totally separate question than who to vote for, and it there's a different rubric, and like a lot of the undergirding assumptions behind a lot of these browbeating arguments don't apply in my opinion, but like I said, I think I'm going to be writing in Hillary, because I think that'd be the funniest right in. I'm going to go into the polls because that's part of the things I like I I when I I live briefly in Washington State where they do the all mail in and I didn't really like that I like going to the thing and doing the thing I'm really annoyed that I've never uh voted on a machine an old time machine. the used to print the sample ballot in my local newspaper in mannerwalk wisconsin and it was it was a it was a sketch of the machine and it had the different candidates and where they'd be and i remember thinking it was cool and i wanted to go and do that but i was too young and then by the time i was able to vote i lived in a different area where they did scantron bubbles bubble uh sheets and then i moved to new york but right right before or right after they got rid of the old machine so i've never been able to go on a machine which is a bummer, but i still like filling in the little bubbles and i like most about putting it in the machine and going. All right, just maybe a couple questions here before I go, thank you, talking about those euros got me hungry, got me feeling eurorific. There goes my hero, watch it as... he goes horror movie suggestions, i said return of the living dead the other day so i got to pick a different one uh on the zombie tip it's actually available on you you can just watch it on youtube peter jackson's dead alive or so known as brain dead that's one of the bloodiest films ever made delightful slap splatter core slapstick not very fun, not very scary, but very enjoyable. what movie spawned, what war spawn the best movies? all right, well we can eliminate a few right off the bat, revolutionary war. what the patriot about it uh war of 1812 i believe there's a movie about the battle of New Orleans with Charloton Hesten as Andrew Jackson but that's basically.
