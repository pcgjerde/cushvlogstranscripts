 I have a chance. If you like peing your colladas and getting caught in the rain, if you like having your boat out, if you like to get brain. if you love making love at midnight and sucking off all your friends, if you eat out at Wendy's, come with me and in my bands, there we go, if you like penis colosis, in your mouth or your butt, come with me and we'll have. some and you will get a nut, if you like getting sucked at midnight, let me bust in your face, i'm sorry, this is a family stream, that's really awful, i shouldn't say that, oh crap, i forgot that repost this guy, I got to reboast this thing here, bubble b, how about this, pardon me, I'm just fanging, all right? do it right? yeah, that'll be fine, you can hear me right? turn the volume up a little bit, that i'll do it. uh, all right, yeah, i'm sorry about the e4 thing on yesterday, just we could not get it to work, we could not get the stream to go, the like the obs thing to process the goddamn thing, i don't know why it was Chris doing it, i trust that he did everything. you could, so sorry about that, maybe we can make it work after the tour, i don't know, okay, hi folks, so we can sadly do universal universe alice, although honestly, i was kind of wondering what i'd even be able to do, because it just looking at the screen made me feel overwhelmed, but what we can do is we can talk about the next two chapters of this here book, first-class passengers on a sinking ship by richer. blackman about the last two countries to make a stab, a successful stab in Lochman's opinion, which is not shared by all, uh, at hegem before declining and being replaced by another hegemon, those being the Dutch Republic, those delightful freaks, those manage eating swamp germans. with their hilariously made up language, which is it's absurdly precisely halfway between German and English, it's like a joke language, like if you were going to make up a a joke language between those two countries, what would it sound like? it would be dutch, but anyway, so those freaks had a short moment in the sun as a global himan setting the terms after the decline of the failed attempted higem uh made by the Spanish Hapsbergs and uh before the French had their failed attempt. All right, I guess simultaneously, yeah, the Dutch Golden Age runs it about the same time that the French are making a play for continental hegemony, but uh, if they were going to get it, they would have taken it from the Dutch in the late 17, the late 1800s, I'm sorry, in the late 17th century, 16, late 1600s, because the Dutch Golden Age starts uh winding down in the latter decades of the 17th century. uh the peats of West Falia actually ended up kind of kicking their ass uh peace was was was the engine of the uh the sort of the elite consensus. uh that had powered uh them to that point of agemany and then once they get peace they're kind of fucked and then they fight the British and they lose even though they have more money than the British that's when Louis the uh Louis the 14th is trying to make his stab in failing before the British take it up so we get failed Spaniards then the Dutch actually achieve a short egemoneny they falter Britain and France vive for. it, the French, the British take it pretty conclusively at uh, after the seven years war, that's the end, that's the that's the clips of France, until you have the brief explosion under napoleon when they you know are able to create a modern state sort of almost overnight that is able to make up for their relatively backward colonial position by just wiping out elite conflict completely with a fucking guillotine, but that was because it was conquest regime, not the kind of commercial, consensual empire, yes, certainly also coers, but not only coersed or not largely coersed. the problem for the napoleonic style of of uh empire is that you cannot get sufficient buying from local elites to make to make governing it a winning proposition, in the long-term, they will eventually revolt because they're not seeing enough money because it's all being hoovered up into the metro. because it has to be sent back to the provinces in the form of pay for your administrators, for your civil and military administrators, whereas the uh consensual empires are able to enlist local elites, get them on board, because they are cut in essentially on uh on the deal, of course at the bottom you're getting a point to the bayonet no matter what, but uh, with more elite buying, you have a more stable uh, civil order that means it's cheaper to administer, which means you get more money out of your colonies, and that meant that in the long run, if a if a conquest regime like uh, like Napoleon's france or Germany's, Hitler's Germany later, when she can no longer expand, you're fucked, if you can no longer, if there's no horizon, you're fucked, whereas a... capitalist ejeny can extend that horizon artificially, whereas the the conquest regime is mired in the need to dominate a finite space that will not allow for infinite conquest, and you're not even get with with a formal conquest you don't even have to wait to to get to the edge of the the globe to run out of room, you'll run out well earlier than that because of the amount of friction with other polities and within the ones you've dominated. that is going to accumulate, all right, so last we met the book, the spaniards because they have this uh aristocratic autarchy rule, where you have a dynasty on top trying to create a centralized state, but having to contend with localized authority that is essentially independent, and then is only able to reproduce that relationship in its colonial holdings, so you have a bunch of independent land owners in Aristocrats who will send back as much tribute to Spain as they feel like they need to to avoid uh too much hassle. The rest they will keep to themselves, they will send out uh into the trade networks of rival powers. They just blead out as they were trying to fill their empire because the the hose was leaky basically uh and that just kept getting leakier as uh the power in the colonies increased as American elites became more influential back in Spain. So when the Dutch who started off as a rebellious province of the Habsburg Spanish empire. This is the amazing thing. They are a fraction of the Spanish holdings, but what they were was, they were the most economically fertile, the most uh urbanized part of their empire, which meant that they were going to be able to uh create local regimes of administ. creative capacity that and and and just cheer engineering ability uh increased efficiency of operations that your big lumbering empire cannot contend with, so eventually not only did they break away uh and they were hejamonic in the process of fighting Spain, like that's when the dutch golden age really begins after the because uh the truce, the 12 years truce in the 80 years war between Spain and Holland that went from 1609 to 16 uh 21 is the space where the duts were able to establish, they were they got the breathing room on the seaways of the world where previously they've been fighting against the Spanish. they gave them the breathing room to turn their nacent colonial holdings that they had built up in a attempt to you get around habsberg rule, they were able to turn those into durable sources of uh economic activity, they were able to create networks that brought incredibly valuable global spices and resources to to the Netherlands where it was able to be turned into capital, and then they use that capital during the... second half of the 80 years war, which coincided with the second two-thirds or uh, which coincides almost completely with the 30 years war, both ended with the treaty of west fain in 1648, by the end of that they had established a genuine uh hegemonic relationship to the other merchantile empires competing in Europe, but it didn't last more than 20 years after that, why? Now first we have to say why did the why did Netherlands why was Netherlands able to build a capacity for Hegemmany and uh we look here we find the same answer as we found in Spain in Spain there could be no hegem hegemany because the polity of the Spanish emp of Spain of the Iberian Union uh was made up of these uh local orders of aristocratic military rule that had been the people who had fought off the mores, had kicked the infidel uh Muslims out of Spain, and in so doing had established firm legal tenure over the lands in their domains, that means legal control of the of the output of their peasants and of the legal system that uh their citizens in the countryside and in the nacent small cities Spain did not have was not industrialized, I'm sorry Spain was urbanized nearly to the degree that the low countries were uh at this point because nobody was, this is before you really see the post black death explosion, that's because people think of the uh the reconquistas this thing that happens in 1498 or 1492, it is a 300 year long process and over the course of it these military orders come up, kick out parts of spanish or over... Socracy after the fall of the the Charlamen dynasty, the original uh holy Roman empire that encompassed uh northern Italy and France as well as Germany, the one that collapsed almost immediately as soon as uh Charlomain's kids started fighting over fighting with one another. The first thing to go was was uh was that area and uh it was never really uh it was only ever lightly governed by uh independent counts uh the peasantry were essentially free, there was there were very few feudal uh obligations uh that they owed to their uh you know their accounts and which were almost entirely in the form of like a yearly uh tides just the old you know the the feudal thing of like you know you owe me x amount of uh your barley or whatever the fuck for the year but no labor requirements which was a huge part of feudalism was labor obligations like two weeks a uh two weeks a a month or i'm sorry you know like a national guard service like you know one weekend a a month and then two weeks a year you got to work on my on the the lord's property the lord's private property and then you provide free labor so that they could have their own agricultural surplus that they don't have to put a fucking finger on it is done but as contribute contribute contribution labor from uh the local peasantry which is enforced by a legal system. which is controlled by the aristocracy uh and only on top of that is like a later larger uh dynastic royal authority in place that never existed in the Netherlands, the the peasants at most owed some uh either rent or uh some of their surplus to their alleged uh uh lord, they were not inmeshed in a feudal relationship with him. and part of that is because of how um labor how capital intensive making that part of Europe profitable as an agricultural endeavor what? because it was a bunch of fucking marshland, it was a goddamn lagoon basically, it was a swamp, and the thing about a swamp is you can make it fertile, but it requires fucking putting money in, and if there's one thing that the spent thrift aristocrats of Europe whose entire economic, their entire role in the economy was to consume, not to reinvest as in their undercapitalism, but to consume, they're not going to fucking spend a lot of money to build uh... and windmills, are you fucking kidding me? just i'll just i can sit in my fucking castle and sometimes like fight my cousins for entertainment and and go to bals and listen to balles, balls, listen to uh brass band music, have my little jester dance for me, i don't need to worry about like oh what, like we got a supervise putting in the fucking uh dikes, we got a design, you want me to tell you uh like what shape the fan blades of the windmill should be, that is a pain in my ass, and I don't need it, because whatever you guys make, I get a portion of it. The only people who were motivated to do the work of clearing that land, of create putting up the dike systems that could irrigate it, they could power uh uh mills with wind, were the peasants, so uh, the infrastructure of the low countries was built by peasant communities, like like uh, essentially. cooperatives uh that where people pitched in their own labor instead of giving it as tribute to their overseer, their own labor to the project of building a dam, building a a windmill. what that means is that when uh, first of all when Spain tries to impose a greater tax burden on the... independent burgers, because what happens when this occurs is it brings people into cities and all of a sudden these farmers are moving into cities and you have these these dense urban agglomerations where consumption happens because if you're in the city you're not growing your own food, you're not making your own clothing and that creates mar demand, demand that could be filled, and it also uh gets people together to figure out things like how to build better fucking uh ship fishing pots so that dutch uh dutch fishing fleets can trap more goddamn fish than anybody and have more surplus from the sale of the fish, allowing more and more land in the Netherlands to go towards creation of consumables uh, not not directly as food, but as uh elements of a greater consumer economy, thing that goes into clothing, things that go into uh uh stained glass windows or or little dancing puppets, whatever the fuck, all the economic activity that comes from. a bunch of people together and that creates this new independent, urban elite, never part of the uh aristocratic structure, the aristocrats, the few that there were getting uh are uh giving each other head injuries in their castles and sitting on their uh sufficient if uh tribute like if they really want more they'll have go get more territory and if they if they try and fail they get killed and then somebody else takes over, the logic is always the same among the aristocrats, I'm not investing any money anywhere, you give me what you have, and if it's not enough, we take over other peoples, it's it's the Rober Baren logic that that is at the heart of the military bandit class that ascended after the fall of the Roman empire, to to assert some level of uh security at the base level to allow for commerce. so that means you've got these independent city folk, literate ones who had they hear about about the same time that the the spanish are turning on the screws and demanding more in taxes and demanding more administrative control over these self-governing cities, this is not like a traditional aristocratic over uh class, this is a foreign uh aristocracy, because there is no local aristocracy, they've been overthrown, you've got the house of orange and a few other guys, that's it, in the in the in the poorer provinces because remember, it's 12 provinces that end up getting independent at first, uh, they get more later, but they are not all equally rich, they don't and not all equally urbanized, some of them become places that contribute agriculturally to cities that are in other provinces, namely Amsterdam, the big one, the heart, the the the city that is essentially the end of the day too big. compared to everything else in the Netherlands to allow for hegem to be established and not so quickly undermined. so they're getting Martin Luther and John Calvin and all these st and all this and and the Geneva salter giving them a culture of religious resistance to the catholicism that undercurds the uh habsberg monarky at the same time that they are becoming independent uh economic actors, so of course they revolt and they're able to successfully fight off, at least in the north a big this army. and it's because you have a unified elite who have a uh who are able to align their interests around the central goal of getting independence and what's this the way to get independence build a durable commercial empire and though they create do things like they create the Dutch East India company and they and and they create then later the west india company and now these are not s "this is not sending out a bunch of uh uh pirates to just grab something and then say it's theirs and then like just write basically have them uh buy a piece of paper from the king that says they own it and then lets them do whatever they want these are administrative bodies they are not technically part of the dynasty or i mean they're not technically like state-owned but they're staffed with the members of a single class of of largely amsterdam" and so it is through that, it is with that end in mind that unified end that they carry out their colonial endeavors and they're so much more successful than Spain is at getting money back to the Metropol because there is no independent power accluing here and that's how they're able to build this this this dynamo and that's why they are the kings of the slave trade and eventually the... the spanish have to piggy back on and at first the British do too, have to piggy back on dutch trade networks in order to get anything out of their colonies, but oh, what's interesting though is that eventually they get these things built, but then the the cost of war begins to overwhelm the benefits coming uh from the the ex to fight it, and the dutch burgers, are paying the vast majority of the cost of the war, Holland and Amsterdam in particular are the by far the most heavy contributors to the state coffers, everybody else is is essentially free riding on the dutch, on the the Holland economy, but those places are filled, those those places where they're making like uh produce and agriculture, they benefit from wartime prices, they actually uh have a vested interest in seeing the war continue forever, but they're losing money in the in the merchant capitals and so in the face of resistance from guys like uh the house of orange who were the military heads of the effort because none of these burgers could marshall that kind of authority, that kind of authority did still reside in the the the the aristocracy that they did have that passed for. Aristocracy, native aristocracy in the Netherlands and that was mainly the house of orange, disproportionally the house of orange, compared in a way that isn't true in other uh dynasties where you had a much greater competition of of large dynastic families, big houses, in gambo terms, great houses rather, and so there's this material interest s split on the question of the war, the d the uh the the... Amsterdam merchants get their way and there is a a um there is a uh truce, but the whole time during the truce there is this political war over whether to uh extend it or end it and go back to war with the Spain and it becomes expressed as a religious war between people who are hardcore calvinists and those are the war party, the people who are making made more money uh uh selling their uh agricultural. products under the war conditions, people who were refugees from the southern Netherlands who wanted their their property back and could only get it if they were reclaimed or liberated her wherever you wanted to put it, and then you had the Amsterdam merchants just didn't want to fucking pay any more money and we're happy to see uh these thriving net the commercial networks being able to be bud up unmolested in peacetime conditions and they are the ones who support this guy arminius who says Actually, you know what, maybe uh, it's not predestination, maybe God isn't such a sadistic monster that he dooms people to eternity and hell fire before they are born, like that is basically burning ants with a fucking bag. less, if God is good, god does not do that, and that becomes this our alternative calvinism, and they go to war, and eventually the war party wins, because uh, the military power of the stotholder is able to essentially repopulate the the uh, the judiciary with members of the war party because of their uh wartime powers and that leads to the leading uh armen getting executed including John Olden barveld, is the head of the the the peace party, and it's it's and it's declared by the sinod of door, it's declared, heretical, and calvinism is affirmed. now that doctrine, that alternative understanding of grace, and free will, ends up being the colnel of methodism. which is ends up basically swamping calvinism in america because conditions get different, conditions get better basically, because we're in America and we're able to secularly satisfy a lot of the stuff that we used to have to satisfy spiritually and intellectually, so we can make do with methodism, and i think that that is the split in the bourgeois psyche that ends up emerging is between the calvinists, the god's will is wrought by deed, those suffer. are suffer at his command, those who prosper, prosper at his command. that is the that's the pointy end of capitalism, that that's the people who were slave owners and who now are small business owners, and the other one, the Armenianism, that is the Christianity of the soft-handed merchants who don't have to extract, because they live in the uh, they don't have to extract because they live in the abstract realm of exchange, w all the violence is done elsewhere. they have been temporarily and specially fixed away from it, so they could have this fantasy that they're good people, and and the god is a is judging their works as they live, which is otherwise an unsustainable belief under capitalism, the dutch invented the slave trade basically, the whole time they're having this fight, they are literally inventing the slave trade, but as soon as they create this new... so the for a minute, for the for a while the uh the burgers of Amsterdam are sort of overthrown, the war starts up again, but dutch uh uh economic fortunes are still great, because they've built this machine that is so much more effective than what the ricky ass spanish can put together, even though they can draw on theoretically more resources, eventually they become the entrepo of Europe, Amsterdam is is the uh the finance capital of Europe, the war ends, the burgers naturally solidify power, and this is where you're doomed, because backman's entire thesis, lackman's entire thesis here is that the the specific arrangement of forces in elite relation, the the specific alignment of elite forces that can create higemony, cannot sustain it, because having higemony creates new challenges, new challenge uh uh new challenges, new conditions that that fixed uh relationship of elites cannot address and so therefore it uh, it it declines, because lastman is is really does believe something that I do too, that you cannot really have a reform from within a given hegemonic uh elite structure, it has to destroy itself. because it has complete command, if it didn't, it wouldn't be hegemonic, that's scary, because a lot of us imagine revolution is this salvation from below, but only under conditions of collapse that have already been created by that failure of the elite structure to adapt, can you have uh a revolutionary situation, which means you cannot avoid the disaster, you cannot avoid the emergency, you cannot avoid the horror. see somebody says the calvinist response to the frying of the magnifying glasses thing is that whatever god does is inherently good uh if god God's God does not get to decide what's good God's goodness cannot be different than human goodness, because that assumes a universal, unbridgeable distance between people and God, and the entire point of religion, I thought. logically, rationally, reconvince yourself, because you can't feel it anymore, you can't feel it, you can roll this fucking things, but they just feel like wood, you can't feel it, so you have to think it. and so that means you have to make God essentially into a rational human mind, but rational human mind is a is a is a construct a expression of a greater total truth that is called God, and that is, I think the only real thing that you can, the only real blasphemy is the blasphemy against that, and that's what the horror that we live in is that we are trapped in a religious. that because of its need to create and sustain class rule has now enshrind in the hearts of almost all living beings a heretical view of god as a separate thing and people walk around thinking that that that that they're honoring God, when in fact they're creating an idol by needing it to fulfill, needing God to fit in your box, that is the horror of the of the uh of the Christian tradition specifically, others are like this too in their own way, but I don't know them as well, but the the uh, the tradition of saying that uh, we have to justify faith, and the thing is, you only have to do that as a, not as a theoretical, not as a spiritual or theological problem, as a practical consideration of the persistence of class rule, because we should not have to justify in our interactions with one another, if we lived what would you need that for? you need to do that because you're the world you see calls god one thing and the people whose name people say? the name while striking down their fellow fucking man, how the hell are you supposed to believe in god than that situation, we better prove it to you, like we just stopped feeling god because we were no longer able to sustain the fiction, the social fiction that that the that that that god like was a force in our lives, it would have to be something that we have to call towards ritually, inscribe ritually, rituals, the only difference in catholics and protestants is the refinement of the ritual away from actual acts like carnivals and and masses and and eucharists and sacraments. and a book, symbols on a page that you look at and think about, those were the Dutch, the kings of that, they spread across the globe, but what they did in doing that was they created a fixed new hierarchy that was not going to be able to adapt when conditions changed, when mainly when the British created their own. to change the compos the the general thrust of their uh of their political economic engine, but because the uh families that had created the Dutch East India Company, the Dutch West India, the west India company had written it into the contracts of the founding of the fucking companies that their families would control their seats forever, trying to create essentially a new aristocracy. within the commercial economy, it meant that if uh, fighting the British, hey, we actually uh, we need to increase military spending here, if we're gonna actually compete with the British, we might not have to like you know build more ships, we might have to invest more, uh, the Amsterdam burgers, uh, no, we want low taxes, please, low taxes please, and they had the ability to veto anything, because the... the the the uh united provinces, the Dutch Republic allowed any province to veto any uh proposal, and so Amsterdam had essentially a ved to over every policy, which meant that they could not adjust, and they got their fucking asses eight, now the French go for it, Louis The 14th. tries to take over spain at the war of Spanish succession, invades the holy Roman empire, go gives it a shot, but he didn't realize that the game was not going to be one or lost in Europe, it was going to be one and lost in the colonies and the French just as we talked about for other reasons and we talked about in previous uh chapters, they did not have the capacity to uh to really compete colonially, who did the motherfucking British? who come in and create the longest yet durable hegemony of the capitalist era about 100 years, although again some people disagree, some people say that British never actually held higem, if you define hegemy as more, you have a greater put out on any given access, like you have a bigger army than the next two uh rivals, or you have a bigger uh manufacturing sector than the next two rivals and the two rival standard the British barely ever uh dominated anything during that whole period. but I think if you take Hegemoneny to mean setting the rules for a global trade network, which I think is makes sense, and definitely is the way that the United States could be defined as aigemany, uh, then I think that this is a good standard and uh, and the British certainly for that 19th century really uh, they had it, they held it, and part of the reasons is that after 1688, glorious revolution, where the uh British commercial bourgeois that had struggling that had been so powerful that had been able to punch through uh the dynastic system in the 1640s kill a fucking king but could not stabilize a uh a non-monarchial uh structure to negotiate elite conflict which is what a government is they couldn't build a new leviathan so they had to have Cromwell step in to fill the gap and then they brought back the Stewarts and James went catholic, which was essentially the second version of the Stewarts trying to fight what was coming, which was the overthrow of the uh dynastic ruling family and and its position at top this um uh this this post feudal uh aristocratic military order that's falling apart that can't compete with the dynamic center of uh capital in the cities and it's Again defined religiously, catholics versus protestants this time, but again on top of the same basic interest structures and uh, they literally import a Dutch king to come in and have him agree after basically a job interview to rule as a reduced sovereign who would essentially be there as a backstop and uh mainly just as a avatar of process. a ritual reaffirmation of like the agreed upon rule set that the bourgeois, the rising bourgeois were going to use to govern in parliament, and so that means that like the Dutch, the British are able to create these uh companies, these chartered companies like the East India Company and allow them to acting as independent corporate entities but connect. loans to the British state, that was the condition of the East India Company and the other companies being chartered is, you're kicking back a shit ton of this money to uh to Old John Bow and they were able to create a uh a structure that was capable of busting open India and turning it into this massive cash cow with the money being directed towards this this new uh center uh and because again this is a staffed bureaucracy and not a bunch of independent free booting would be uh failing aristocrats and like up-jumped uh boot uh buckeneers like in Spain uh their employees they are able to be uh uh constrained in their ability to operate independently of the Metropol except or and they are... able to exercise though individual initiative, this is the crucial thing, but and that individual initiative pulled the British state deeper and deeper into India probably against its own wishes, but in so doing without anyone knowing it building these like roots that would end up taking a hold and creating this insane money or uh capital machine that just pulls estimates of trillions of dollars, i believe $45 trillion dollars is: estimated amount of wealth taken from India uh during the and during the East India era and the Raj afterwards, but instead of that action creating independent power power bases, what it really did was it built a incredibly robust British state and bureaucracy that when the time came when the East India company was cutting too many quarters, pissing off too many natives, doing something like revoke provoking the uh in 16 in uh 1857 they were able to just nationalize the motherfucker unlike in the Netherlands where those companies operated as these independent fiefdoms their entire existence buse cuz the burgers could veeto uh the more um uh all the money coming into England created a unified elite block in England that was able to exercise influence through parliament, the interests of rural land owners and industrialists and commercial uh merchants and financiers all came together around extracting resources from the colonies, domestically manufacturing products in England and then distributing them to uh both uh a well-established internal market and also uh to through the rest of its um... uh colonial holdings, that was a state capable of just having a vote and saying yeah East India company uh that's now the that's now uh a brit a arm of the British uh state department because the big the big money thing that people had were not shares in the East India company although plenty of people did uh it was shares of government debt it was it was it was was uh, it was corporate bonds, it was stocks, so they are able to um absorb the East India company and create the Bellapac of England, the the Victorian era when they were the the dominant force on the planet, the proof I would say, the ultimate proof that the British, the English in the 19th century were absolutely hegemonic and... way that the United States later became is that one of the most important contributing factor factors to the failure of reconstruction had nothing to do with armed resistance by racist whites in the south, the Johnson the disastrous Johnson administration, corruption or anything else, it was the goddamn gold standard which was imposed by the city of London on the rest of the world. "if the United States did not want to get completely fucked in its trade with the British, and the British were their number one trade ally after or number one trade partner, had been since the revolution, because who else was there to trade with, nobody else had the networks, like the fucking jacksonian, the Jeffersonian democrats hated that the federalists wanted to trade with their old enemy, but the federalists even though they were a bunch of fucking stiff neft aristocrats, at least recognize that the British were the actual ones who were buying." so the US if it wanted to maintain a decent trade with Britain and not end up having its it's it's uh currency inflated away in value by a run on its money it had to stay on the the gold standard. now it didn't have to, and I think there was a politics a greenback politics that guys like Benjamin Butler represented that could have fended off that, but it would have required the full emancipation of uh southern slaves, instead of the failed attempt to do so that reconstruction became, but one of the things that made that made that made that thing inevitable was that in a context where uh, there was great resistance to the imposition of reconstruction, there was basically an incapacity at the federal government level to deal with economic conditions by increasing people's uh livelihoods, the... higher period was this deflationary era when these cyclical panics would destroy the economy and then there would be no federal aid possible because there could be no uh debt uh run up there could be you could not just print more money so that's how and that's and that was a decision not made in dc although the majority of people in both parties wanted it that way because they were of American capital, which was essentially a uh symbiotic creature connected to British finance capital, but it could have been fought from below, but we didn't get a we didn't get a real fight against it, sadly, but that's a hegemonic motherfucking uh power, I get to this. but that's only India, the other thing you have is the settler colonies of North America, uh, Oceania, those are where the problem comes in, that is where your higemony gets fucked, because you get the same contradiction emerging that fucked up the Spaniards, which is independent power accruing in. the colonies, now the place where independent power accruwed the most broke off the United States, the other places did not have sufficient to resist uh fully British power, but they still had a capacity to extract um concessions, and you see in those other countries, a willingness after the US has lost to a se to to concession largely because the British throttled America the way they did in part because they didn't think they could afford to lose the revenues they were getting there, they couldn't afford uh to uh bleed out to the US developing its own independent trade networks uh because it did not have us anything else to back that up uh it's it was still nacently in India. when the other uh settler colonies start acting up, India had been well established then as a huge money winner, a huge uh, a huge resource uh, like American cton could be replaced by Indian cotton, uh, slave labor in the Caribbean could be literally imported from uh India, so you could give the colonis more of what they wanted, you could give them more leeway, and the other thing making them want. get more Leeway is that eventually this independent uh ruling elite or uh this this united ruling elite which again it's composed of everybody most of the old aristocrats who were land owners they bought theirselves into the finance economy the the the uh the manufacturers had the merchants had everybody it bought into the financial economy so they had all settled around a common interest around free trade means you can't print money, means you make money for capitalists through profit, but you cannot return it to anybody made it, now that's fine in the colonies because they don't count, they're out of your your your social structure, but they will still resist and they resist everywhere where they feel that they're being squeezed this way, and the states has an interest in being able to deal with that, but what stops them? from being able to is that these independent settler colonial elites are able to demand things like their own tariffs to build up their own domestic industries which fucks British manufacturing which you need, you can't cut out the heart of manufacturing or else your financialized economy will eventually blow away in the wind of fluctuating uh macro conditions which is exactly what happened to the English they could they were they stop the their the dynamic uh unifying elite that went out and conquered became completely resistant to actually paying for a fucking empire. Nile Ferguson claims that uh the British had this like full commitment to empire that they imposed through like this culture of duty or whatever the fuck every British Aristo and uh and and merchant and and and shop owner, anybody with a a piece of stock with their name on it, spent the entire British Empire era bitching about how much it cost, and they were paying a incredibly low rate, they they didn't, there was a doubling of the tax rate uh after reform finally kicks in that takes the top tax rate to like 7.4%, and that was doubling the previous uh amount. and they have the ability because of that control of parliament to shoot down the sort of investment in an actual military that could allow you to defend an empire, instead of eventually give away so much to these peripheral elites that you're for essentially competing with them, so that means that by the time the Americans and the Germans catch up in the late 1800s, their manufacturing uh base is collapsing, let me read some crazy shit about about uh how how how quickly British manufacturing collapsed at the very end of the 19th century, let me see if i can find this, but this thing like it created this insane wealth, this this huge jump of wealth at the top, it also raised wages, which is what minimized domestic uh v like the domestic uh uh labor war, like that that's a big reason that uh Britain never really developed a i mean they got a labor party but they never really developed a meaningful uh i mean i remember like Lenin Lenin for example was like the the British aren't going to do it and a big reason for that is that that empire did have spoils and raise wages went up and the ability to do a thing like go be a colonial officer or go make it into one of the colonies was a live option that diffused a lot of social conflict, but eventually by the 18 late 1800s, not only are they having to fight like other white people, which means you can't use colonial troops, many most of the wars fought in the 19th century were with colonial troops, indians mostly, so they could get killed all the time and it wouldn't matter, but then you get the... war, you can't have, you can't have uh uh indians getting used to killing white men, so you got to use all white guys and that pisses people off, and it costs a lot of money, they want to spend uh less of it, but the reason that this uh your manufacturing gets killed is that um bank consolidation sucks all the money out of the local economies into... to foreign investments because that's where the highest rate of return is, nobody wants to invest in local businesses, so that means that local manufacturingers, which is most of them don't consolidate, they don't get the um influx of credit that they got in North America and in Germany, which is an industrial policy, that can't be carried out in England, what what the desire of the of the financier is is the desire of the ruling class in uni in dominants if not unison and so they say no dice so that means that local manufacturing falls behind, it doesn't consolidate, it doesn't get the the uh the competitive advantages that the consolidating manufacturing sectors of of north america and Germany get and it starts falling behind, we find this goddamn fucking I should have marked it. Okay, here it is. No that, I'm so stupid, I'm sorry, I get, please, keep staring at my bald spot, where the fuck is this, have to give up, i'm a fucking idiot. suffice it to say, in the late 19th century uh, the uh english, british manufacturing output is absolutely collapsing, uh, which means that they're losing on a bunch of other axis including militarily, which means when the big war comes, uh, they're fucked, and they turn it decline, and then who's there to pick up the ball, people who are able to take all those uh, are able to at a later date consolidate a different and more dynamic set of elite interest into one unified elite interest, but you know because there are few resources and we finally hit a global maximum, the uh time before crisis emerges and something has to change is much shorter, which means decline sets in even faster, and we are now in the decline phase because we have an that cannot be challenged from without, all of their interests are arrayed against one another or all of their interest against a general interest, because they have created structures that give them the ability to overrule, they used to have a unified interest with the state, so they could together steer it, but now the state has an interest in like taking their money, the state has an interest in breaking their political power, the... state has an interest in radically reducing their share of of profits, but they build structures that ensure that that is the one thing the system can't do, it's like how Robocop can't kill anybody who works for ocp, like yeah, if they're unified, they are unified in resistance to any centralizing uh oversight. now they all think it's for their own reasons, but they are all still motivated collectively in that direction, and even there though there are sectors and specific power structures that aren't, they get swamped, now the question is what happens next, like the decline of these previous hegemons is relative, they don't stop being powers. they don't stop having uh economies that make a lot of money for their elites, they don't stop having a functioning political economy and and social structure, they're just no longer in the driver seat. the difference now is that America decline does not appear to offer a viable alternative. China is the one everyone talks about where again elites have emerged later to deal with some of those problems. oh the Chinese actually can where they need to exportriate, they're not, they're not programmed to not be able to excorporate, but the problem I see with that is that the the structural problems we have are so deep that they go beyond uh uh simply redistributing on top of a a capitalist political economy, because we're exacerbating with every action the... crisis conditions more than any human action can address them, we're behind the eight ball, all right, here it is, fucked. All right, Britain's international investments and the ease with which British investment firms facilitated the transfer of capital around the world, helped firms in other countries borrow the money needed for industrialization, which then made competitors for British industry. This led to a boom in industrial production worldwide, but a decline in profits, which hit the less efficient older British firms harder than newer, technologically advanced and vertically. integrated American and German corporations, does anyone does this found familiar to anybody? man, he's a scholar on these subjects, who defines as exceeding the next two powers combined, finds that Britain. that standard for industrial production between 1860 and 1880, on a per capita basis, its industrial production was more than double the next two powers. from the 1830s to the 1880s, Britain still retained first rank in the 1900. um, all right, sorry, on a per capita basis its industrial production was more than double the next two partners from the 1830s to the 1880s. Britain still retained first rank in 1900, falling behind the United States by 19. 13 by which time total US industrial production was 250% of Britain's and Germany had surpassed Britain. Britain accounted for a third of world industrial output in 1870 and a seventh in 1913. It produced a third of world seal in the late 1870s and a 10th in 1909 to 1913 when Germany produced twice as much and the United States quadrupled British output. Chronic trade uh chronic trade deficits were. clear indicators of Britain's declining position in the world economy. now that's a problem that we don't really have, that's only marginally ours, because we took financialization further than the British could have possibly done it because of technological innovations, but we are still in a general downward trajectory because of an inability to maintain a domestic real economy, because there are knock-on effects of that, one of which is there's somebody other than uh uh these freak elites able to exercise political power. there's another thing that is able to sit at an elite table but is not composed of actual elites, only uh, i guess you'd call them labor aristocrats if you're thinking globally, you're able to bring to the table actual workers, whose who do not uh wish to see the state destroyed and replaced by private power completely, because the state is what? with them, they are fused to it in a way that uh can't be the same with the rulingelites who all imagine themselves as having emerged first and for the state to have been imposed upon them. now at at the base level it's meaningless distinction, but psychologically and culturally and socially it's very important. so like you've got for example these uh local extraction capitalists in america. the the the small bourgeois of the big bourgeois, the beautiful boaters, whatever you want to call them, you know, from the coke brothers and the teals at the top, to uh to skilled electricians with mortgages at the bottom if you want to be totally uh uh open with it, but of course not equally powerful, not equally accessible to direct energy, which is why talking about them as one group is kind of dumb and it just becomes a question of like moral - moral uh vote and that might contribute to something in an aggregate, but individually, individually they have as much moral power as as the sports fans, especially compared to the other members of this broad coalition, actually are able to pick and choose to fucking serve in office, that's way more powerful. and those people are big capitalists, they are not just petty bourjois or home-owners or boat owners. and they all recognize the doom state that we're in, like liberals are really hamstrong politically because their their legitimacy resist resides in maintaining a cafe of a functioning state. the republicans have a big advantage is that they get to point out that the thing is falling apart. problem is, from like a objective perspective, they literally want to make everything worse, all the things that are making it bad, they want to uh exacerbate, but they don't know that because they their class understanding is through the screen of their personal identities, they're and that is why their politics are identity politics, even though that's what they claim to hate most in the world. and that is competes elites competing for what they think is staying in their position, maintaining their power, because they see one way or another a threat to it, but none of them are able to uh actually effectively do it, look at the libs, the libs believe that these other guys are gonna destroy fucking planet, that they're going to destroy of the American uh, government and they're not really wrong about that, they are like objectively opposed to the continuance of democracy. as we practice it in America, that cannot be denied, whether they can actually do that independently is the real question, but they think it's real, they hold positions of power in political parties, they write checks to political parties and they can't do anything effectively to stop it, they cannot even if effectively challenge them at the ballot box, even though demographically they are the... govern, they are the natural party of government in the United States, and yeah, like they are heightning the contradictions, the working class isn't heightening anything, I mean people are doing it at their workplace, but there's still no pul, there is no cultural or political. machinery structure on top of that energy that struggling, yet it's being built in our as we say as we speak, and all of us have have a have a oh, we all owe it to ourselves to contribute to it any way we can, but you know really, materially, and if we can't, you know, find something else, but find figured out, oh god, I hate prescribing, you can't prescribe, can't prescribe, can't prescribe brain annurism. but I'm not saying it doesn't it um it won't exist, but right now it isn't there, which is why all we have is this uh this one-sided class uh this one-sided uh mobilization against a failed liberal political consensus and constitutional order, but they lack cohesion too, which is what under my their power and their ability to exercise their will, they're all trying to sell each other mlms, they're all trying to pick each other's pocket, look at fucking banning, him and those guys, they want to fucking save america from the chinese or whatever the fuck they think it is, from the bug world, and and they're stealing millions of dollars from their own supporters with some fragilent idea of buying the wall and building it to yourself, an impossibility. That's why it's so fascinating because you have a total awareness of the uh bankrupcy of the moment but out without any constructive. response, now we all have individually, I think correct readings of the situation, but we cannot structurally reproduce our action along our understanding of it. That's why I'm definitely thinking that after this book, we'll take another little break, but then I want to read one on China, somebody gave me a good recommendation, I book about China, the rise of modern China, uh, and where where where their governance is at specifically right now, I would like to know, it's very, it's it's definitely a black hole for me. I mean look at the democratic parties uh ginocracy, the fact that it's all 90-year-olds, this is a perfect example of this, no institution that had people within it operating on a consensual understanding of what is best for the organization would allow that to happen, and it wouldn't be hard to prevent, it would not. be hard to prevent that from happening, all you need to do is clip seniority a little bit, all you need to do is get enough people together when a challenger when somebody seems like everyone understands, okay, this person's a little too old, they've lost their fastball, we can all agree that they're going to go, and then you just present it to them as a fait complete, and they got to go, they have no choice, but everybody is a siloed little political entrepreneur, so no one can... shit and so they just keep winning elections, because they've structured it so that in most of these safe seats an incument can't be defeated. so the voters are never going to notice that they're a billion years old, and you can't as a party edit them out, that means you have no control over anything, which is why I just can't understand anybody who's like still clinging to it, the idea that the democratic party can chall can can represent anybody's aspirations for resistance, for uh counterveiling force. all right guys, gals, that was it. next week we're going to dive across the span of time and across the Atlantic to the new hegemon, the decline the current, the the once and future and non-forever king. the... American state, good old USA, and I think we'll just do one chapter each for this last section, yeah, we'll see, because I think these are uh, like individual articles, basically. I should raid hasan, what would they they would not notice, how could they any would notice, it's a fucking raging torrent over there, does he actually read that chat is he able to do that? if he can, that's amazing, that's skill. Oh my god, everybody's always asking what the book is, this is the book, first class, passengers, not a sinking shit, Richard Lackman, yeah. All right, I'm out of here, chumps and chumpets.
