 through like a star in my sleep, i open up my eyes to pee, find I was by see gazing with tranquillity, was when in the herdy man came singing songs of love, and the herdty man came singing songs of love. Here comes the hirty girty man, he's singing songs of love, histories of ages past unenlight and shadows past, down through all eternity, the crying of humanity. and here come the hurtig man, he's singing songs of love, hurdy gurty, hurdy, hurdy, rolly, poly, rolly, poly, rilly rolly poly man, rolly poly, rolly poly, rolly poly, rolly poly, roll singing songs of love, hurdy, tongs of love, hurty girty, man, donovin, one of the best credits roll songs ever at the end of zodiac, i saw zodiac, i saw zodiac at advanced screening, i guess i got a little pamplet like a little card, hey go and see this for free, great, cracked pack packed theater, when the and when uh Jimmy Simpson when the McPoil, he goes, that's him, I cuts the black and he goes, before he could be interviewed, Arthur Lee allen died of a heart attack, I heard the entire crowd do this collective exhale, this disappointed sign, it happened in Unison, and I got. say one of the most like you know you talk about how the whole point of the uh the theatrical experience is to have those communal moments and usually they're of catharsis but just to like to have this theater-wide collective thwarding of catharsis at the very end it was powerful - then the fucking creepy ass herdie girty man kicks in it's great like you're fucking haunted by this guy who can just play you a song of love and then you'll never have a consummated, it's great, which is why zodiac is not really about how you can't know about what happened and like it's the impossibility of certainty, it's not about that at all, that movie is adapted from a book by a guy, Robert Greysmith, had a pet theory, he's not one of those guys who looked at you know this un uh solved historical mystery and decided to like bask in the uncertainty and like turn that into a... create pursuit, no, he said, hey, yeah, this Arthur Lee Allen guy, he did it, and the book, and the movie, even though I think Fincher is much more ambivalent about it, probably doesn't even necessarily believe that, just by virtue of telling Gray Smith's story, you smuggle in this like actual narrative, and that's the reason that everybody sighs at the end when we saw it, is because they're like, fuck, we couldn't have our knowledge consummated, and that's really what it's more about, it's about how even if you know. what happened, you can never be satisfied, it's not that you can't know, it's that knowing does not provide the satisfaction, the culmination that knowing is supposed to, because if we're not seeking knowledge of what's really going on, then what else are we doing, right? but what does that knowledge gain us? nothing, it can't be gain us anything, because we can know anything and it won't change our behavior, that's why. you want to talk about great songs uh that speak to the specific like contours of modern alienation from the self uh Leonard Cohen's everybody knows everybody knows that the dice are loaded, everybody knows the war is over, everybody knows the good guys lost, like people want to, oh if only everybody knew who killed Kennedy, it's like what, two-thirds of the population think that in some way or another the government was responsible for the assassination of president Kennedy, what are they doing about it, why would that number going to 100 change anything? that is the... fundamental problem with conspiracy theory as a heuristic for understanding history or the current moment, not that those things didn't happen, of course they happen, you cannot have - global capitalist hegemy without a full uh coersive apparatus, we have some fantasy even like with a relatively radical critique of American imperialism, that there's the places where we could worst capitalism into being and the places where we uh where we basically bribed it into being, but no, every level of social order, from the president of the United States, if his name is John Kennedy, to exploited workers and certainly minority workers in America, there are people who have to be brought along coersively, outside of the law, because remember we're not, we're talking about how there's x amount of coersion that needs to maintain a a class rule. right, over time that number has to get bigger, because there's more people who are being exploited, their or their exploitation is organizing them around the feeling of being exploited, it requires more output, there has to be a continue a escalation of uh coersion, now part of that is buying off some people so they're not fighting, so that they don't have to be coersed, and that makes it easier to concentrate on those who cannot be reconciled. in any way to the system as it exists, and so that doesn't just mean imperialism in the third world, it means assassinating the president if he gets out of line, it doesn't understand what's going on, doesn't hasn't really doesn't understand the the real context of America's victory in World War II, are the real, not the context, the real uh consequences, like when the United States decided to to go to war with the Soviets and with the former colonial countries on behalf of the political. that the uh that imperial Europe and Japan had left on the world, they decided we are going to uh put this thing back together Frankenstein style, and that means we're going to have to repress the fuck out of a lot of people, and that includes people at the heart of empire, and so it's no coincidence that as the CIA is being formed, you have the creation of or you have the the red scare, this cultural war on communism that... has political uh effects in the form of purging uh the most progressive elements of the American Democratic Party coalition which could have steered the US towards some sort of negotiated uh co-management of the post war world with Russia and I know that seems insane and it's like yes the moment FDR's brain caved in that possibility went away. as soon as truman, the fucking party hack from Missouri whose mom was a southern uh partisan who uh talked about much about how uh she fucking uh thought it was good that Lincoln was assassinated and when she went to the white house to visit her son she wouldn't sleep in the Lincoln bedroom so like you've got this cultural package in this guy coupled with the fact that he owed his position to the democratic party, not to the coalition of left-wing and progressive forces that involved that that was centered in the Democratic Party, but which had come together in a popular front to win World War II, in alliance with the Soviet Union. The question was, will that alliance continue into the task of rebuilding the world, or will it turn into war, and we made the choice to do that. The story we get told. is that Stalin was this, he basically closed curtain down, said no, fuck you, and we had to, in order to defend freedom, match that, but that's not what happened, this is what's happening, by the way, while uh, the CIA is being built, while truman is authorizing the building of the CIA. Oh yeah, no, and true, the thing is truman was like progressive for the time, he had genuine progressive values, he wanted to continue the new deal, but he hated communism. and he didn't hate communism merely because he was a apparatic of the Democratic party, he also hated it for visceral personal reasons, because it suggested missegenation, now again, that's you say, oh, you're talking about, this is ideal. No, why is Truman there to be president in the first place? because the left couldn't keep Wallis on the ballot at the 44 convention. This is where you see that by the time you get to the creation of something like the CIA, the die has been cast, and so while you can describe what the CIA does, up to including assassinating the president, doing MK ultramind control, selling uh building up every network of large-scale drug mark, drug uh sales in the world. standing up the cartel system that the uh that the global supply chain then piggy backed on top of, they did all that shit, but they did it in a context where the the the the social muscle necessary to like really resist the imposition of capitalism on its own terms, which the new deal state had pushed against and was being eroded away from the position of like being able to sustain. that uh, what that meant is that while the CIA had to do what they did to maintain the the position they were on, they were not doing it in a context where the any of their discrete actions were determinative, they were always happening after the decision had been made, after the crucial real battle between the the working, the global working class, the the global proletariat, humanity at large and the the algorithm that is like parasitically sitting a top like the uh the human institutions of capitalism of the capitalist like developed world and so well you can map the terrain fixating on proving specific. events within the context of the deep state and with the context of our understanding of like the role intelligence plays as a crucial butterus to the structure, the greater structure of capitalism, like it's a necessary component, it cannot be done away with, the CIA still exists and does stuff, although I would argue that now intelligence is more of like a make work program, because one of the things that the CIA did was make itself obsolete, like it. have to intervene at the most at those crucial points anymore, because they didn't have to worry about those moments of arising, because instead of trying to do cansian uh like inefficient um like uh mid-century modernist shit like brainwash individual people, the market can just unleash the product of uh of of you know of of raw research carried out under like... the the funding of the government privatize this technology of the internet that is going to structure human life in a way that is going to tear us out of any kind of social context where our actions can have political consequences that's why we have to we can as an entertainment only for entertainment purposes only we can observe the arc of uh the intelligence state but if our politics become applying a uh, a heuristic of conspiracy to every event as it unfolds, that will only lead you into inevitable uh neutralization by the fact that that process, the process of just taking individual events as they happen and then trying to make a narrative out of them given the brick a brack of culture that you absorb, that is how reaction popular culture is made, that is how reactionary mass politics, such as it exists, can be made, is through those narratives, what, what the what socialism, what marxism is supposed to do is allow you to look at events as they happen, neutralize that need to go down a fucking rabbit hole and find someone to punish like you're in a fucking movie, and get to the question of... How do I improve my conditions, how do I improve the conditions of my children? How do I make the world I live in conform with any kind of value for what human life means? but my god, no, I can't do that, I have to solve the riddle of who did 911, or I have to expose uh, the plan demic, like, okay, good, go for it, you're going to end up never finding out why, and what I mean that by that is, you will convince yourself, you've already convinced yourself, what you will not have is what you're dreaming about, the fantasy that is pulling you forward, which is that the re'. changes something, a fundamental fact about your life in the world, catalyzes a reaction, because like even if you are just like a person likes to talk about conspiracy theories and has no contribution to the research, and somebody else pulls out a smoking gun, you're going to feel like you were part of it and that it was, it's your victory, that is going to, that's what's going to, that's the reason you're involved in this, and other people involved in this, they're trying to get off, you're all trying to get off, now you can think in your head, I'm trying to get off, because I want to overthrow the structures of capitalism that uh, that stop us from me being able to organize, and it's like, okay, yeah, I understand you want to do that, but nine out of the 10 of the people who are doing it with you don't care about that shit, they want a narrative of violence, they want someone to blame, then they want to come together to uh make them. suffer, which is the fucking narrative, that's the mass political narrative that fascism offers as an alternative to the pursuit of like socialism as a utopian nirvana, it is, no nirvanaism or utopian like uh horizon, i should say, no, utopia and horizons are impossible, we are it is man against man, there can be no deep cooperation between people, we are strangers to each other, which means we will all eventually destroy one another until there's only one left, and so then we must seek out our enemies and destroy them, and how do we find our enemies? we see who does the bad things in the world, and we try to punish them. that's where a queue comes from, that is why the center of gravity of like conspiracy theories about the Kennedy and stuff has drifted rightward. you can argue, oh, it's because the left doesn't taken it seriously enough. no, the labidinal uh gravitational pole has dragged it there. that's why Alex Jones became a reactionary. because he's selling a a politics not of the hard boring of actually changing things, but of a fantasy, a fantasy of of consummation through violence. you're never going to get there is the thing, and you're just going to keep running until you smash into the this is the death drive in throned that represented as fascism that can only be distinguished from the rest from capitalism in any other condition. is it, what's the difference between? it is, it is uh, the conditions, the material conditions under which capitalism is operating, that is what the only difference is. now the reason that, but the thing is is that time is the other factor, it's not just material conditions, if it was material conditions that we would be back in like classical fascism that we imagine is like a mass seazure of power by a mass political party, represented in our case by the republican party, and i i can see why we want that to be, because yes, if it's just a question of like capitalism in deep crisis where even at the core of it, there's massy felt alienation from the system and and and like unchanneled hostile energy, like that is true, but we are a hundred years past that point technologically, that's what we forget when we think in only one of the two time or place uh factors that go into.... considering like a a context that we're considering historically or even uh contemporarily, and what that is, that hundred years is wrought is a depoliticized, desocialized people who cannot act politically the way people could act politically in the 20s, they are, and when I say they couldn't, it's not, it doesn't mean that they can't physically do it, and it doesn't mean that they are too weak or pussified to do it, it means that the... things that would should exist to reinforce their actions like to echo locate against don't exist, because people are like, in any situation, this sucks, i want it to change, then what do you do, in some context with some degree of uh technological uh, you know baffling between people, you get one amount of uh political uh like meaningful political organization, but in another like well the one we're in, all of our political uh energies get dis diffused into enter aesthetics, which in politics is fascism, like we like imagine Americans as uh like and this is why it is a fascist thing, this is why like this is this the psychology is fascist which is just accelerated capitalism, so imagine you're an aztech right, and you're like uh, are like like everyone understands that you have to uh, that there has to be violence in the enjoyment of pleasure in a ranked society right, like the ASTEC uh tribes that like became the conf that came together like on those on those islands in in in lake i can't pronounce it uh they were like these warrior bands who like had these hierarchies of power within them and they were able to come together and and organize collectively by agreeing to turn their violence into games into sport, but the problem is someone still has to die if there's real consequences, there's real consequences, if it's not fully uh, if it's not removed fully from the class system, the exploitation mechanism that is grinding away at every moment at the like very enamel of civilization at the its bones, so like - to be a American who considers themselves and lives a life where they are getting they are addicted basically to capitalism, put it that way, the way that the thetex were addicted to their class rule, in the sense that they cannot imagine any other situation where they would be in the same position, specific like like the their their enjoyment of life would be dramatically reduced, and the main reason for that is not even like oh they're afraid of not being able to eat a million burgers and they're afraid of not being able to have a giant mansion and all that's bullshit and that's part of it. That's not all of it, part of it is a genuine belief that, well, because we treated the rest of the world this way, there's no reason that if the tables were turned, that they wouldn't return the favor, this is why Jefferson referred to the slave owning class of the south is holding a wolf by the ears, because when you do stuff to people, you know at a certain level, it's wrong and it has to be laundered somehow, you have to make them deserve it, but that only displaces the guilt, it does not eliminate it, and one way that it manifests itself is in a nerotic terror of the other, and the thing is, the only thing that defeats that, this is why, this is the problem and why one of the reasons we can't act politically the way we used to, is that the only way to get over that is to have faith, uh-oh, oh no, faith, yeah, shit, you have to have faith, fuck, that sucks and we got rid of that. and again it doesn't go anywhere, you know, this is a closed system we're talking about, this is this is there is no uh place for anything to run, it all stays in the system, uh, it just got displaced to the self, so the only thing we believe in now is the soulf, and that means that the the thing that got the fucking uh, the you know millions of um, storm of like brown shirts to go out there and like street fight communists and then you now very quickly, enthusiastically wage a war on the rest of Europe, they did that because they still believed in something beyond themselves, now they didn't call it god anymore, that had been destroyed by the 19th century, as Nichi said, but there was still like some notion of a unity to stand in for God in the community, in the in the in the sense of of other people, and of course the great clash of the 20th century was, when we say that, do we mean the nation or do we mean uh a class? do we need these nationalist concepts or do we mean a class relationship that correspond that means that our violence has to be directed upward is what i'm saying? now the reason fascism took over and was was taken up was able to take power, fascist fascism was able to take power because it was people who wanted a violent reckoning, but didn't give a shit at the end of the day about uh, about her utopian horizon, at the end of the day they just wanted power, they convinced themselves that that's all that mattered, and that's because at the end of the day they bought the final lie of capitalism that the self is the only thing, and that is what's eating us is that we are all one way or another captured by a theology of uh self-worship, and the problem with talking about this is that people immediately turn it into a fucking moral question, oh you're all. now there is nothing else to be, it is like, it's amazing, like the same people who want to like defend like slave owners or like... vikings by saying like they had a coherent moral code and it was like of the moment and you're present, you're using presentism to try to to critique them, well then look at their fellow people who are narcissistic, in by the way the exact same way they are, no difference at all, except for branding, and then blame them for it, it's like i'm sorry, they are not, none of us have ever lived in a different world, i've never breed the air, you know, like what the hell is water, you know that joke, the fucking uh, the... two fish are swimming and one of those fishes says turns and says to the god damn the water is real warm today and he says what water or i'm sorry what's water? but what this procludes is the mass politics of fascism? filling the gap, technology, what does that look like? and to me it looks like branded techno dictatorships, and because there have to be two brands, because remember. "there's another half, there's another group of these people who at the end of the day are just as death worshipping, they also believe the self is the only thing, but they also adhere to a remnant of the puritan ethos that says that if I do something, that there is a god who will recognize me, some kind of collective entity, history usually they think of it as, but like not in the dialectical sense, like just in a narrative sense, history will remember them well." because they did good things, that's liberals, but of course the end of the day, liberals are more addicted to the capitalism uh, then they then are uh able again or willing to act politically to actually challenge capitalism, but they have to supplimate that guilt somewhere too, and they do it by blaming republicans, oh and blaming fascists saying, they're making us do this, but they submit willingly, and the way that, but and the way that they'll be able to submit willingly is to federal. and I really do think the great divorce is much more likely than any claim of the senter because the center is collapsing. We have seen the government response to real deep crisis right now in the last two years and you cannot, I know people want to say the cruelty is the point and like oh these people are doing this because it's a siap or it's a great plan demic if you're republican or like a based socialist or it's like oh it's white supremacy and it's cleansing if you're a leftist, but at the end of the day it's neither of those things, the state doesn't have the capacity to do it anymore, to do the things it used to be able to do, because it has had its guts eaten away by marketization, by financialization, by by the death of the public sphere, it doesn't go anywhere, it is just privatized, of course there's going to be. there's violence every day, there's violence now, 50 people in a fucking uh trailer got fucking wire seasons two on the mexican border just the other day, the violence is everywhere, it will continue, but it will continue to grind up the people it's grinding up now, it is not going to change its target, that's what everyone, the change of target is the breach with the old world that all gives us permission to act and freeze us of obligation. That's what we're all hoping for when we can finally act out the movie, but for precisely because of that reason it can't come to pass, because it's what we need to, and we're imagining that, it can't happen, because what we're imagining that we need is actually what our libido needs, it's not what the moment requires, it's not what's actually happening, it is a libidnal delusion that we all collectively engage in, because that's the only way we can engage in politics is through the narrative spectacle. i hate to reuse that word so much, but it's it's very meaningful, and the and the reason we're able to do that is because how much of the actual sinues of the state, even though those are buckling, are automated by capitalism, by the flow of money through the system by the wind through the the pin wheel, the reason we're in a huge. crisis now though is that the thing that fuels this is this uh this politically determined input in the form of US dollars that are circulated and and and how and where those that money goes is a political decision, it has not been fully automated yet, it's behind the times, it's version 1.0, it's literally presided over by fucking nonogenarians. And there is, and the thing is, the system is going to work, no matter what, it's going to. adapt to whatever crisis, politics spits out and it's going to win because there's no there's nothing else contesting anymore, we're all just individuals trying to survive, and what we're going to get inside uh is continuing amiseration at the bottom, renters, but yeah essentially starting with anyone who does not own a and then basically how much, how good their job is, how much access they have to uh generational family wealth in the in the form of like maybe their parents own a house, their proximity to home ownership, they will be the their misery will be determined by their proximity to uh ownership, like land ownership, and and that will be capital ownership. basically and that will be determined both just by like the grind of history like oh unemployment rate just pumped uh you're all fired and now you have to live with way less money in the same conditions and you have to juggle that and that you know eventually you're going to fall off of the beam everyone is cuuse you can't stand it forever it's it's it's it's ground going away beneath your feet it's just a question of how long it takes so that's just the grinding thing in the background happening indiscriminately based on on pure money, but then you have the individual encounter with fate that is determined by their proximity to land and ownership, encounters with the police, encounters with uh uh violent criminals, encounters with uh even hate criminals, their encounters with disease like corona virus, their encounters with uh discrimination and and most lack of care and interest by uh intervening institutions because they don't have the money to make anybody care it isn't being paid minimum wage to do so all right so this is once again a very long way to introduce a chapter from uh the making global capitalism by Leo Panich and Sam Ginden, we get there eventually, we always get there, so I I did the same thing uh on Friday, so I ended up having to only do one chapter, and I want to, I don't want to get in the habit of that, because the book is very neatly organized into two chapter parts and I want to keep that going, so I decided today I'm going to go through chapter eight, uh, wrap that up and then do uh the next section chapters uh 9 and 10 week from today, next Tuesday. Oh, but just to finish that thought, uh, what this, but then, and then of course, like encounters with law enforcement, like what's legal, what's illegal, to like, you know, because people are going to be on the wrong side of a lot of discriminatory lines, in like uh, popular culture and in legislation, but they will be able to protect themselves with money, it's going to go from something that is an existential threat to something that is an inconvenience. and bad and traumatic psychologically, but it's not a direct existential threat, and then for some people they're going to encounter it stacastically, and boom, they're actually going to be the thing everybody else is scared of, and there's going to be more of them over time, like that's what's going to happen, like we're describing the imposition of you, like a techno-fascist regime, but who those people are, I'm talking about is in terms of like numbers percentage of the population uh, and and specifically like the uh, their... part of a process that is like social wide is is is uh not different, and this is why, it's not necessarily even going to be that way more, you know, social enemies are going to be extinguished in red states uh than in than in less fascist uh blue states, it's going to be that some people are going to be chased around by the state ritually. to make everybody feel better in both places, and in both places that is going to be part of a larger tesilation of like everyday miseration that will be socially invisible because it's not what anybody is going to be paying attention to, they're going to be because we live as cyborgs and we're cybernetically connected, they're going to experience this state, like they're actually going to experience the state, because remember we're talking about the people who are not falling. into the cracks, because if they were, they wouldn't be on the board anymore, they wouldn't be part of the public, the assumed public, they by definition are all on the board still, and what they share is, the desire to not think about what's really happening, especially the closer to precarity they are, because that means thinking about their own vulnerability, that is destabilizing, they would much rather think about literally anything else, and so that means let's think about what the state is doing, what we could theoretically be in charge of, even though it's a fraction of the violence being doled out by this machine, as it tries to strip the last fucking shreds of profit out of this goddamn uh globe. and the thing is that's not that doesn't say people think this is domerism but the but the fact is is that yes political action as we conceive of it in this forum is impossible but that's not the definition of political action that is a fantasy deluted. uh concept, symbol of that term that we use to allow us to carry on with the fairy tale that we're doing politics anymore, when we consider ourselves with who's getting elected to these offices that have been drained of any actual authority, and that is why the only meaningful political question is, do you have the horses for that, which again and because it is meaningful, it cannot be spoken up, but anyway, the flip side of this is that while you're imagining that nothing can uh, while you're trying frantically, because you still believe in it, you're trying frantically to to operate these these uh, you got to the the cockpit of the plane and you're trying to move uh, okay, here it is, here's the metaphor, people can understand and hell, the right wing things talks this way too, that like uh, the political project is anyone you could. and when I say political, I mean our imagined idea of what a political uh project is that would involve us mostly voting, sometimes demonstrating, spending money and joining orgs and it's like, well again, that's politics, but it's not by definition all of politics, it's the only part of politics they can't be legally spoken of, and therefore it's the only one that's visible in the discourse. so you participate in this thing, and that means that you are fixed on what's the state's doing, and so the state is using its limited remaining uh um discretion, picking and chooses who is going to be made a public victim of state violence, and again, not evenly applied, organized around those who resist, who get turned into... either couldn't keep up or tried to fight it, and I think because of that, you're never going to get your horizon, to be a devolution to the states and then within those states the continuation of politics with one side winning more and more and just doing more of what they always did before, which is going to hurt more people over as time because more people as percentage of people in the system are going to be like unambiguously hurt by the current conditions, not just not like the people in the center, not like the middle class w determined determining all this psychially, not just... in their feelings, in their fifees, which is what they're doing, and why their politics can consist of voting and legal stuff, because politics at the end of the day is aesthetic to them, because they're not really suffering, now yes, they're suffering generally, but they aren't suffering in a way that alienates them from the system. i'm talking about myself, but i'm talking about millions of other people too. now at any time cataclysm can break this whole thing open, this the black swan event can crack it open, if there's anybody left to to look through the wreckage you will be able to of course show prove oh that thing that wasn't some random event that was uh the clear and un unchangeable direct consequence of these earlier actions and you'll be right but it won't matter because we can't see it as it's happening it's it's all subterranean it's all our it's you're stepping onto like ice and the ice is cracking. but not in like at the top where you can see it, it's cracking it like the base, and the cracks are like running and deepening, but you're not seeing them, and then the whole thing is just going to burst out, it's not going to. "the thing about those is that by definition they cannot be predicted, so like the same, convincing people that a specific type of catastrophe is about to happen is just like trying to convince a bunch of people that a specific conspiracy theory about a a significant crime, like I'm going to prove that all the school shooters actually are uh MK Ultrad uh uh gladio people. Okay, good, you did it, congratulations." now what? well, now i believe this, cool, what are you going to do with that knowledge? i'm going to convince other people too. well, shit, if you convince them, what are they going to do with it? the same thing you did, which is meaningfully, nothing. the thing to take from this though is that you still have to live a life, you can't know any of this. you can have suspicions and you can have personal beliefs that guide your decision making, which is what you should be doing all the time, but they cannot be ever uh a horizon to chase because you can't get there, like that, why is it not, why is the conspiracy fantasy a courtroom? why is it always a courtroom? the conspiracy theory of fantasy almost always ends in a courtroom revelation historically, and why? it is because the fundamental underlying notion of... of the conspiracy narrative and the fact that it's rooted in libidinal politics and not in class politics. again, there's you can, the whole point of class politics is that it fuses the labido to class interest, but that is something that only happens through the process of class consciousness formation, which we have lost, so few free people have that, what we have instead is just this floating politics that wants somewhere to go, that wants a container, and and uh, theories is the container that like it gives to downwardly mobile middle class people, people who have some proximity to home ownership and are feeling downwardly mobile, plus of course the a big chunk of the middle of persecuted minority groups who are much more generally alienated from capitalism than uh than white guys for example, white guys and girls in the middle uh class have some relationship to. in the form of home ownership, the fantasy there is that you get, you prove it in a court of law, a neutral institution with power to adjudicate right and wrong and punishment, that's the important part, you can prove something and then the court will make a judgment and it will be rendered, and the and the the guilty will be punished, and that under assumes a fundamental institutions like the court and constitution and that is, I'm sorry, that is, that belief is incompatible, incompatible with socialism, because as soon as you believe that these institutions have valid, have validity, you have to have a personal understanding of why, and that means you have to build a history of America where things like the constitution and the court system. uh are uh did good work for people and help people out and it's like they did, but only in a greater context of being the scaffled of like political uh of uh cultural uh social coersion that allows capitalism to be birth, it's built in like the it is, there's contradictions that are inherent here, and and the conspiracy theories seeks to flatten those, and it says you get the court everybody understands and and they e persecuted, and and that's what Q and on comes from, there will be a day when all will be revealed, and the thing is, it's just a socialist, it is just a secularization of the of the Christian fantasy of uh apocalypse, which by the way is the uh theological, spiritual, like uh, supernatural version of the yearning for a communist utopia, before you can get the dream of a... utopia, you have to have the the religious dream of the kingdom of heaven, and that is why for a Q and on, they have totally fused the coup, the day that Trump takes power with the second coming, they are identical in their mind, because it is the great revelation, everyone will know the truth, and the truth sou them free, but we all know that's not true, and the thing is you don't have to reject religion to believe this, you just have to given that would any situation uh exist and be ever be able to be brought into existence when the system as such man by people believe in the system is presented with evidence that would require its own abolition, would it go forward? no, it would protect itself, it would never allow that court case to come forward, and now you can say, well we have, we don't want a court, we want a rev and that's another you know headlong run into a brick wall because again everybody knows okay Kennedy was killed by the government how many of them are are now going to believe politics that include a narrative where uh Kennedy was killed because he wanted to stop the gas taking over the government, which is a basic uh thread of a lot of queue and on stuff, where are their politics going to go, when it's time to fight and the trenches, you know what I mean, it's they're going to be organized around the the rooted land based remaining capital that is at war with finance capital and is trying to uh immunetize itself, the same way that the United States tried to immonatize itself in Iraq as like a last gasp effort. to resist being dissolved into the world uh market as because the thing is the United States is placed in uh as the the center of global capitalism was always short it could never last forever because eventually the system equalizes itself there can be no America like eventually there can be no America in the global capitalist system it it will dissolve that uh poll because it it tends towards this equalization but it it requires first you know uh it required the nation state as a birthing mechanism and it has gotten to the point where it's at least it's usefulness, but because we do have like institutions governed by people who have understanding of themselves as Americans that's separate from the project of global capitalism, but they responded to that not by revolting against capitalism because they that is impossible to them to conceive of trying to invade Iraq and take all of that uh soft power that we'd accumulated over the cold war and make it hard with a actual physically in manifested empire, the kind that had gone out of style after world war 2, but the now in a mayaday type situation we're going to start grabbing for, and we failed, and that's why it's turned inward and now we're destroying ourselves in seek of in seek of uh finding who's responsible for this this declention and punishing those accordingly. so how do we get here? how did we get here? the answer is the 1970s and 80s, i'm sorry, we're now in the 80s, the 1980s and 90s, which according to uh, the authors of this book, is where capitalism a global system of capitalism became not a horizon be pushed towards, but actually achieved imminence, this thing that we're all seeking. one way or the other was either annihilation or with uh communion you know barbarism or socialism the classic thing and we're on the barbarism path and that's what's driving us all crazy because we don't want it but we don't know what else to do. okay so uh we talked last uh week about what this meant in America, the buck breaking of the labor movement basically in long and short and the creation of this credit economy where people are still... to be consuming and they're still going to be spending, but they're not going to be spending wages that they earned as that were per share of profits of the uh industry they worked it, that was stuck, they were never going to get raises of wages again, they were going to get credit, they would allow them to keep spending on the more and more advanced and cool technology that was capable of being pumped out uh out of the same out of the tech uh boom or the the uh the tech revolution of the 70s which of course was something that was publicly fucking funded and then privatized so that it didn't become this agora of... human liberation that the California ideologist idiots thought, oh what's this, material conditions uh interven, oh no, they sell it all to the private market, meaning it all just becomes crap for us to buy and the further enslave us, oh darn, again, why do you need, you don't need the CIA anymore at this point, you have a digital MK Ultra that is just going to rewire every human brain according to the capitalist imperative, mission accomplish, sit back and relax. but again, that doesn't mean that the role of uh of enforcement goes away, it just migrates to the private sector and that that's started in the 80s under Bill Casey, after after the buckbreak, one of the things that got buck broke in the 70s was the CIA and the national intelligence service in in uh, in general, and uh, Bill Casey solved that by creating a parallel, privatized, privately funded intelligence uh system that was outside of any america, any uh democratic oversight, there had been theoretical oversight that was exercised in the 70s and now that was eliminated. and that's that's the that's what iron contra was about in part was building this network with fucking uh coke money building the network with fucking uh money that got turned into or that with uh coke money that came from turning uh contra supplied uh yayo into crack in America's inner cities at the same time that the a black working class was being dispossessed the people were at the lowest at the totem pole because they had the lowest access to fucking land because they hadn't gotten in on the great post-war bananza, so they had to be fucking pacified and coers, drugs and then the drug war on top of it, it's it's a perfect system, but again, these are all things that are caused by other things within it, it's this kind of beautiful unity, and we only can like gock at it and then try to live and apply our understanding of what we're looking at to the condition of building something different and totally separate from. without its institutions and outside of its parameters, because within it we are trapped. okay, so so according to the panden and panich, 80 to ths is the 20 year period where capitalism totally uh, fixes itself uh in the global system, and and all of the nodes of resistance like the uh, you know, the developmentalist uh uh third world non-alind countries or the command economy, soviet union uh, those were all gone, and and the Chinese had decided to hitch along for the ride, so the the the financial institutions that are built now internationally are the ones that took this from something that was a system among systems to the only system uh, and how this happened in Europe was, further process of buck breaking different uh left-wing parties and letting them know the deal and having them get the Ned Bady speech and finding out you cannot do certain things unless you want to change your relationship to the state in a way that you just can't f fathom because you don't believe in enough you believe in yourself and again you didn't choose it you were born that way it was dissolved out of you it was leached out of your bones what were you supposed to do so you get Francoi mederon who and while everybody else is electing reactionalries, we get thatcher, we get Reagan, uh, in France, of course, those fucking the French, God bless him, always trying to fucking zig when everyone else is zagging just to show that they are different and that they're not part of the herd, they elect Fran on this fire breathing socialist platform uh and with an absolute commitment to doing the opposite of neoliberalism, advancing state control of the economy. the way that the bennites were proposing to do in uh in the labor party, they got crushed where the might the Swedish social democrats were proposing with the midner plan, what uh Chile was trying to do uh, and you know in Chilet, because it's in the periphery, you that's where the CIA shows up to give guns to a bunch of psychopaths and have them murder everyone uh, but in in in Europe, in comfortable old Europe where everybody sitting on their assess and having their 15th uh red wine break of the day, capitalism is doing pretty good for them, they just want to live better conditions under it, so when the state says to them like meteron that they said to meteron, okay, you can go forward with this and we will destroy the economy, because the thing that uh had been created by the end of Breton Woods was the ultimate discipline, like the ultimate whip hand had been created when they unpegged currency and they got rid of fixed exchange rates, because when you let uh exchange... rates float, it means that a particular country can be targeted for destruction, to have all of its fucking uh reserve currency reserves just taken out of it like with a with a giant fucking vacuum uh and this happened in a number of countries that the that the US empire wanted to discipline who in the third world particularly like Zimbabwe and stuff uh Venezuela. uh, it's a cap, it's a capital flight, it's called, uh, and uh, it basically means a run on your currency, your currency becomes... so scarce in the country uh that you can't make payments, because your the capital has fled and turned into money elsewhere, all of those uh, all of those franks are going to get it turned into deutch marks and get and and uh sterling in dollars and you're not going to have any fucking money left, we are cutting you off basically, because your ability to build anything to use an economy depends on this global cat trade system. so that means you have to work with our our fund bucks, you have to use the itchy and scratchy dollars that we gave you, so unless you're willing to do a revolutionary government that institutes a like wartime scarcity and probably go to war with your neighbors, like shooting war with your neighbors, if you're willing to do that, then you can try to have uh your your socialist france in a in this moment, but if you don't want that, "if you'd rather stay president of France and for all the socialist and uh MPs to stay in their position with their three mistresses and their four fucking pietta tears and their their four-hour uh snail-based lunches, of course meteron and the rest of these guys take the deal uh, he went to he went around to the to the other European uh governments first and he said hey we can create our own coordinated exchange rate group outside of the system and like you know pool" or resources basically like and and create a bigger pool of economic activity that could like you know generate its own flows and it kind of it could have worked because you know uh western Europe is incredibly rich uh and very um uh it's it's very rich and very advanced it's it's like the most one of the most advanced parts of the world in terms of uh capital accumulation that means you could actually maybe build something more efficient thanks to that you could do cybersin on steroids maybe but everyone told the fuck off, including the Social Democrats in Germany, so once again a crucial moment in history and who's there to stab any hope of change in the back, the motherfucking social democrats, I think it's very poinent, so so meter on of course classic french uh, he was a lifelong socialist, that's what he believed in, but he was also the most french man of all time, uh, he had like a bunch, he had a secret family and a bunch of mistresses, his secret family came to his funeral that apparently was not awkward at all, everyone. like, oh yeah, there's his other family uh, so I guess it wasn't even a secret, it was just other family, and then so he was, he was a man of appetites, he was a man of pleasures of the flesh, and so of course he doesn't want to go to town and and he doesn't want to fight a gorill, a chegavar gorilla war, leave that to the puritans, you know, uh, I think it's very fitting though, that when he was dying, you know, he had his part in building this machine, and of course what he got out of it was a fantasy of European integration, so they basically told the... look, we're all doing structural adjustment, you're going to have to uh kill the dream of socialism, but we all now because of these floating exchange rates, the Europeans we got to come together, we have to create our own currency, and the US basically gave permission right then and there in the early 80s, late 70s to allow the Europeans to go, start of this process of getting their own currency in the Atlantic system, not outside of it, that's the important part, uh, and uh, of course, meteron's able to convince himself. "this is going to be the this is going to be the vessel of human liberation is the European Union, and it's not going to be my generation, but future generations who will lead us to the promised land, so I can just be a fucking dirty old Frenchman the rest of my life and help help dismantle socialism as even as it was any nacent structures of it within the uh French state uh, so when he was dying and he's looking back at his career, uh, he decided to have uh, as his last..." basically uh a sumptuous array of pleasures with the center piece being ortalon bunting. Ortalan bunting is one of those things that was like a cool reddit fact that people learned about in like the midds and then it like made its way 10 years later to mass culture and now you know like it's there's a succession reference like I think there's another show that has got ourlon uh it's it's now just like hey sort of like project paperclip that's an other thing like people just started talking about hey you know we got a bunch of nazis uh uh from Germany after the war what uh and then you now there's like four shows where where they're playing I've seen two streaming series in the last couple years to have uh to to needle drop Tom Layer's song uh Vernar Von Brown you know um but yes, it's a song bird, an endangered I believe song that is uh, fried hole in cognac, drown first, I believe, and then you uh are supposed to eat. the whole thing hole in one bite with your head under a a napkin. In fact, I think the reason a lot of people learn about this is because of a famous a relatively popular article that was written about it by a journalist at the at the dinner. Uh, and you eat it under a napkin because you're hiding your shame from God, because you are killing and eating this like perfectly pure little beautiful thing, and you're chumping through the the gristle and the bone, the tiny little bones, they're snap, they're stabbing you in the mouth, and it sort of... ritual that's supposed to you know ground you in your pleasure and like situate pleasure within a greater concept a greater context of sin and that like you your pleasure is at the at the at the pain of others uh and like we all deal with that, but the thing about the rich is is that the rich turn it into a sadistic uh uh fantasy of domination, they turn the the uh the the misery that they... carry out on others into a pleasure to themselves, this is the ritualized element that like the nerdier members of our ruling class do again, not because it's in it's it's power, but because they got to do something, they're not going to actually be pressing any buttons that mean anything, so why not have go to the uh the epstein island and go to uh bohemian grove and molest some kids together and believe fantasize that you're actually in control of anything because you imagine you're like summoning you know the spirit of pure domination from the earth and you're embodying god in that way uh have fun but the wheel is turning no matter what it's all on fucking autopilot you're just you're rich so we don't you're not a threat to the system you spending the money is one of the out the the the consequences of the system like these people getting rich is not why capitalism is doing what it does it is a algorithm it is an unfeeling uh imperative to create profit doesn't care where it goes. "we decide where it goes and that means that we're going to let our rich people sit around and fucking imagine they're in charge of something, and that means people, dumb asses going into politics, smarter ones going into secret societies to do uh fuck fests, because you've gotten past the fantasy of thinking that you're actually in charge if you're carrying out political uh decisions, and then you get to the point where okay, the actual violence that I carry out on real human beings is is the real power." and i can ritualistically magnify it to be my power over others, that is really just the machines power that i'm piggy-backing on top of. so it's all a system of people fantasizing about agency, so like we at the bottom, i mean no, not at the bottom, but i mean like outside of the power structure, you know uh, look up at them and we imagine what they're doing, and we tell these stories about what they're doing to explain why they dominate our lives, and they're all. are telling these stories to each other to explain, yes, that's good, we should be doing that, uh, but the thing that we have in common is that our actions are extranious to the fucking uh outcomes, it's called ortolon bunting is the name of that meal, it's technically illegal, but there are places if you're rich and famous, you, but I do think the idea of meteron like at the end commit, doing that, what's really fascinating is, did that mean did he do that as like a ritual of acknowledgement of the pain he has? caused and uh as part of some greater expiation, but like uh covered in this like facade of pleasure, but like indicating a deeper yearning for penitence, or was it a fully self-conscious essentially demonic ritual? thing is, you'll never know, can't bring him back, now fucking uh, i don't i do not speak. so even if we got him board i wouldn't be able to tell you and and the thing is that the conspiracy question that all ends up leading in his head, it all ends up at the end of the day leading in the head of people at the are also along for the ride, not to the same degree, but in the final crucks of it are, which means their most extravagant acts of personal will are going to be their least consequential ones, the stuff that's the most against the grain and like personally violent and flambollant is the stuff be processed through the system itself, the the pleasure they can't get elsewhere, but also the pleasure that is dependent upon the underlying system of oppression that they're part of. all right, so meteron in the french, they get buck broken, they do the great reverse, they do the great turn around in 81, they say all right, we're doing structural adjustment, they got us, because if we don't they'll just, they will create hyperinflation. because when the money goes away, the only thing you can do is print more of it, but the actual capital has gone, all you have, all you have left is this fiction of money and it's represents capital, as soon as it doesn't represent capital, it becomes completely ficticious, which is why the numbers stop meaning anything, and that's why it was always very silly to imagine hyperinflation in the United States, because hyperinflation is a disciplinary tool from the center of capitalism. now what's changing now though is we are in the final stage shift to where America's central role is being removed and it's fighting back, Iraq was part of it, Trump's tantrum, the war in Ukraine, these are uh sanctions against Iran and Venezuela, these are all part of the process of attempt to create a stringle, building a wall and building the cyber wall and building alliances with all the fucking uh tinpat coke dealing maniacs who run Central America uh and of course trying to undermine the pink tide in Latin America, now the thing is though, nobody is resisting them is resisting them along class lines, they're all resisting them along the lines of the interest of their national. China, at this point i'm sorry, it is national, the thing is China, you can't really say, it's something new, and that's what makes China so interesting, and why I am at the end of the day ambivalent about it, too soon to tell is true and life said, and also it doesn't matter, that's the beauty part, I can leave it at that, because what am I going to do if China's good, go to China, I guarantee you they don't want me there, going to stay here and just cheer them on for the side. the penent, how's that going to do? i can leave it at that, that's the beauty of this whole approach is that it allows you emotional freedom from certain subjects that could suck the fucking orgone out of you. so surprise and and of course in England uh not only does do the does the right take power but the labor party would you know uh this one of the... oldest and most uh influential and and uh labor uh social democratic parties in in Europe has its socialist principles ripped out of it by new labor so I mean and and of course the SDP had already been uh neutralized so this is the end of the left and of course the communist party uh in Italy is going to come apart in tandem with the Soviet Union so you're losing any real nodes of political resistance uh and of course this integration that's now going to happen uh what's the shock of shock it begins with the end of capital controls completely because capital controls are legal regimes that states can use because remember the state is in charge technically of this of this whole operation the state is there at the guide post or at the trading post like putting up and down the arm you could say yeah no you can't take capital out of the country that means we can do... things and avoid hyperinflation and avoid having our economies destroyed by a capital strike and that is that is one of the things that made capital initially resist uh post war state, the post war Breton Wood system because they thought oh no this is going to be if this is the new deal overseas then it's capital controls in all these countries which means our money will not be safe and they were resistant to it but guys like Harry Dexter White literal communists who are making these systems. thought to themselves, like meteron did, this institution is going to bring us about world communism, he could look at the Bredwood system and say, we're going to constrain capital and move the direction of uh investment in a social direction, in a social uh of uh vector, we're going to turn the the flow of money, flow capital development towards uh social ends, and that was a big no no uh and of course they didn't even get the initial they they only really allowed themselves the law the uh the uh reserved themselves the right to impose them in the future that's all they really got because it was watered down so much because you know the the flow was against the left even though these guys didn't even know it yet at the at their high level they didn't know it was it was over before that there was already like the tide was turning these systems were going to be turned against uh the entire uh you know working class everywhere. but at the time they thought it was real uh, but this now in the new the new world, they can no longer afford those bobbles, no more capital controls, goodbye, and this is going to be how uh these states are all brought in the line, like uh, there's a big um, there's huge currency explosions in Argentina, uh, and then of course, oh Mexico, and there's the uh, the Asian tiger economies in the 90s, I think we'll probably talk about that in the next chapter, uh, start uh... and that's all because of currency flow, because the floating currency exchange system, that's how George Soros made all his money by the way. "I wonder why he's such a social liberal, he's literally the embodiment of the global capital flow as like a disciplinary structure outside of the control of anyone government, including ours, which is why our middle, which is why our political class is going insane, and we're eating our own brains, because we cannot recognize our position and negotiate from it, the way that Nixon tried to, the way that Berniey has talked about doing, uh, because we're afraid of..." what the fall would look like, because we're afraid they would treat us like we did to treat them, because at the end of the day we are all middle class subjects in our political efficacy, because our institutions are fully working class, or middle class, but again, not middle class in the sense of even really a relationship to capital, so much as a uh an identity or that is wrapped with notions of race, gender, nationality, uh, culture. that uh warp us away from expressing uh a solidarity in our politics, we can only hurt each other, because helping has been has been literally eliminated from the programming, so this means that uh, that London, which is been this clearing house for US dollars and a way around Woods from the beginning uh in a big backdoor of US capital uh into and out of Europe, but had remain their original uh structures because London was the first was the place where like classical liberalism liberalism was born where the idea of like independent currency, independent uh uh independent market already existed so there were very few uh formal regimes of regulation that the city of London had to push against when becoming institution still needed to be updated and part of that was uh getting rid of any restraints on uh derivatives because that's where all the action's going to be now the a thing that exists now multiplied through time uh to try to stave off the crisis of profitability. that's at the center of the system and isn't going anywhere and is only exacerbating uh, but it also got for the first time an scC, it's not called that, but it has the same function, and it's because neoliberalism is not the state, like deregulatings things, it is the state changing how it regulates things, that's it, it is going from regimes of enforcement against actions. because the the the new deal thing that pervaded to the 70s was basically no, you can't do that, you can't do that, you can't do that, uh, hindrances on the actions of capital, uh, what comes in its wake is uh, things that expediate capital in the form of insurance against risk, because the thing about a financialized economy is that it is much more volatile, you got a classic productive economy, sectors can sort of... assumed to be in the long run profitable, but if you shorten it up, if you make it uh, if you shorten that time frame, it becomes much more internally volatile, and that means a lot, the risk of like catastrophic collapse, like uh, that the kind that break down an economy and and and throw a wrench into this whole system uh, accumulate, and so you've got to minimize those chances, now used to minimize them by preventing institutions from doing things that would lead to that kind of a speculative bubble. starting with the late 70s, early 80s, it becomes, we will now ensure that if it does happen, it will not lead to a collapse, because we'll just pump liquidity into the system, we will just because all it is is a when when when you have overproduction, it is it's just there's no money being made to be spent, you just dump money into the system and you solve the problem until it the real business cycle kicks in, like that's the that's the thing at the base of the of the uh of the austrian fantasy of the of this is that oh you can always just pump money into the bottom and again that is in one condition that's not any more stable than the kensian uh fordus to compromise that that came before it where you had a regulatory state and public spending that wasn't stable either because the material conditions deteriorated well our fucking material conditions have deteriorated. and this is also when Goldman Sax becomes like a global brand. Goldman Sax is not one of the old boys on wall street uh and there's and they end up overtaking all of them in doing business in Europe and selling all these new um instruments. and that's because the old dog can't really learn new tricks, you know uh, scientific and financial progress is measured in uh funerals, you know, it's the counian incommenserability question, you have this new world, and you have these old bankers who just don't know how to accommodate it, because all of their structures are based on these obsolete paradigms, the new guys, hungry, less, at the end of the day lazy because they're at a lower spot in the totem pole on the in the chain of the food chain. have a motivation to adapt, and they do, and then boom, they're over there, and goldman sax becomes the vampire squid that like eats the entire economy, and that basically administered, they become the JP Morgan, basically of the uh of the uh 2008 crash, because it's amazing, it's 100 years, 1907 you have this crash that uh is rescued by a liquidity dump that is coordinated privately by JP Morgan, uh, then they build the federal reserve and like they create this this this new system to regulate the thing, you have the but you have the great depression and you have the ups and down to the market, and then by 2008, 100 years later uh the government is carrying out at the end of the day what is just the same thing as uh what happened with Morgan, the the uh the the the orders of a player on the board looking to stabilize situation for the the state. stabilize the situation for their own gain, which is why what we get instead of a re-regulatory state, instead of public investment again, is just fucking liquidity, liquidity at the top, first and foremost and only, if anybody wants to talk about fucking liquidity at the bottom, that is doing class war on behalf of the rich, but it is, it is just more currency, which can be done from the center of the system, but again, our centrality is waining, this is an emergency mission, we're banging on the fucking button. try to keep this thing propped up, because we've given up on the hope of of gracefully changing our lives, it's going to have to crack up. the forces that would have moved us towards accommodation with the forces as they exist, were all destroyed, they got assassinated, they got uh purged, they got uh outmaneuvered by a more concentrated, more technologically advanced, uh, more coherent, uh, concentration of human energy around the the magnet filings around the iron bar of capitalism, so goman sax is out here dealing out these uh these instruments in Europe and meanwhile all the European banks start embracing American practices, America's best practices, look at these guys, these guys are killing it, they have lower unemployment than us, they got everybody wants us treasuries, these guys are are are where it's at, we want to be like them, and one of the things they embrace is the no. the the theological concept of shareholder value, that there is only a short term fedutiary responsibility, which of course this is the ethos you need when you have shortened the time frame, robbing from the future to keep things going, um, you have to hit the fucking uh gas and the only way to do that is to have people think it is not just like the smart objective. thing to do in some uh uh uh uh what do you call it fuck um empirical way it's not something that you're like oh observing and then saying that's the right thing to do it works in practice no it's deeper than that it's theological that's what they believe in and that's why now we can they can they can carry out trades that are eating out eating from within the heart of the thing that they're trying to preserve. because they can't preserve that without undermining their deeper loyalty to the shareholder in the moment, which is a fantasy, it's it's a theological delusion that they're that they're wrapped up in, one of many that flow through all of us at every level of the chain, um, and so in this context, these new newly americanized firms in Europe and goldman sacks are flowing, the FDI back and forth, we're getting a huge, huge uh surge in foreign direct investment both ways. It's European money coming out of uh or Europe or it's dollars being bought by Europe in the form of treasury bonds because the the new Vulker rates are so much higher that the return is better and then coming back in the form of uh Europeans buying American uh exports and and uh and American real estate stuff like that like bringing the dollars back the dollar the title flow even flow title gravity uh so Europe, Europe has higher unemployment uh than the United States during this period uh consistently through the 80s and a big reason for that is that uh in the so I said that... uh you had the big drop in profit, everybody did basically the same thing in the businesses, the things that they've been told to do, if the economy uh, if like the profits drop, then you invest more in the business, you invest in becoming more efficient, like that's the first thing you're supposed to do, it's a native instinct, and they teach it to you and all the good business schools, problem is the united states uh that uh um the efforts to uh to make it more efficient ran into the organized workers who said yeah no we don't want to be more efficient what the fuck are you talking about we want uh efficiency means a more alienated work day for me no thank you i need more money if i'm going to do that you want me you want me to work for less money and alienate myself more no thank you uh they were eventually broken but like it it made it so that that initial attempt to uh prop back up profit failed uh in Europe where the working class was much more organized in the United States those efforts to uh become more efficient were even more easily and quickly thwarted, so unemployment uh stayed up because those firms, it is true like they lost the efficiency, now again efficiency is not a good abstracted out of its relationship to uh capitalism, it's like they don't have to become more efficient to get to fix profit, we could get rid of profit, this is only on their and under capitalist terms that this is a choice that has to be made, but the choice that they end up making is all right, fine, fuck you, you don't have, you don't get a job then, we don't have these profits, we're not paying you, so you can sit on your ass, but again it's a it's a mark of working uh power, now in Japan, one of the reasons they did not have an inflationary crisis in the 70s is that when the Japanese firms decided to start uh in making more efficient their processes to uh rescue profits, they were up against basically nothing because the jacket Japanese working class had been fucking completely lobotomized by the fascist uh imperial Japanese state just like the German working class has been decapitated in west Germany which is of course like has the least has has the most American like uh political economy that is built up after World War II uh so there's no working class that could really resist it and so you know they were bought off with uh with high interest rates in the in the 70s, I mean they were bought off with high savings rates and the ability to like save money uh in the 50s and 60s and then they were just you know hyper exploited, but the uh European governments all realized there's nothing they can do internally to fix any of these crises because it would mean saying what they meant, it would mean saying like hey we actually have to you have to work for less if you want to work, they want to say that so they had to walk talk around. and so politics becames this argument about like if we could get a euro together, if we could get a fucking euro, yeah, the Japanese thing didn't eventually burst in the 80s, uh, because all they had, they were like us, like at the end of the day all you have is is more money in the system and eventually uh it pops, the thing that's preventing it from popping now is just there's nowhere for it to go, but that's going to change with time, but you know it's a question is there a pop or does the bubble? i would say that we're in a situation where the bubble doesn't pop, it it uh, it is drained, but it is drained in a way that is very violent and not smooth and in fact uh horrifying. um, but it's not, does not destroy the central machine that is necessary, remember to keep all this going, because they still need the US state with its money and its nukes to not fall apart, they really need America to still be america as we understand it. where the treats flow more than anything, like you can't have a country with 330 3,000 nuclear weapons and uh, you know, a currency with its level of uh market penetration, and like the consumer heartland of the world, you can't just have them fall into oblivion, because then everything will fall apart, now eventually they could fall into oblivion, but it would have to be long after uh, their uh power had been depleted through that exanguination I'm talking about. That's why I think it's more likely that the thing is going to be just dracula drain to death, because the other is a outcome that, other stakeholders in global capitalism have a interest that aligns with capitalisms to prevent, but eventually, eventually you cannot sustain profit and human intervention in the system, not just the democracy, human intervention of any kind, and when I say that, I mean people acting with. the system and believing themselves to be in part in control of it, and then we're going to be, if there's people left, they're going to be like the people in primes of the future, if anyone has seen that movie, uh, just a bunch of estetes whose are you living in the ruins, but are technologically kept in sort of a bubble uh with the last remaining uh profit being accumulated because it has to go somewhere uh just you know doing uh rituals of sublimation of their sense of responsibility for their condition and why things are the way they are. so anyway in Japan they were swadded like a baby all through the 70s, just you can have capital controls, you can have tariffs, but we're not, we're going to let in all the Japanese uh uh stuff you want, because you are too crucial to geostrategic politics in the in uh Asia, you are our bullwork, buse remember, China fell in 52. or 48, I'm sorry, uh, China fell, Japan is the only country with like left that has is anything like a a developed power to like project and and uh and circulate American power throughout the region, so they had to keep it propped up, so they allow their industry to just almost overnight go from uh, like textiles, they go, they do a speed run through the whole 19th century, they go within a few decades they go from textiles to... to um to light machinery and electronics to fucking cars, to industrial shit, like they go through the same process that you know killed however many million people in Russia uh, it all goes out peacefully because it's being all the misery is elsewhere, it's it's in the places where uh value is being pulled from the earth at no recompence you know through coersion and it's they give it they swattle it, i mean like... you can look at South Korea and Japan basically were given the the profits of African uh uh economic activity during that whole time and this means they have a weak labor movement because it's structures have been destroyed by the war and then you know they didn't get high wages there uh but they were able to uh save more money uh and and imagine like a uh horizon of security and home ownership which kept them relatively docil along with whatever cultural uh processes there might stamp down class conflict uh so yeah there's lower inflation higher on high but higher levels of exploitation and uh and that uh so you have uh there's lower inflation there's period 70s but it's because you get on one hand high exploitation and then the other a low cost of... capital in the form of cheap fucking credit, low interest rates, which go all the way through the 80s until they're no longer sustainable in a in a global system of of circulating capital and circulating currency, and popped, and that's where you get the the 90s as the japanese uh lost decade, i mean these were people who were Americans were freaking out about Japan taking over the world, hw went over there and barfed on their fucking prime minister, michael crighton wrote a book that became movie uh about uh Japanese intrigues and industry and oh man you should see it rising sun uh uh Shan Connery Wesley Snipes it's a hooot it's a hooot to have the movie Gung Ho if everybody's any seen everyone's any seen that one with uh with Michael Keet with Michael Keeton that's a good movie uh Ron Howard I believe it's one of his better films honestly I think it's kind of underrated um of course it's you know it's capitalist propaganda but it's hollywood but it's a fun movie but anyway all of a sudden overnight yeah no worry about the Japanese and you know the reason they couldn't hack it take the ball from us and like go to the super cyon level is because they didn't have the population they didn't have the level of capital development to do it uh they couldn't hold it up and and the reason we're not having a pop now is cuuse China can't... do it, that's that's what's going to keep things from popping off is that china can't do it yet, and honestly though, the thing is, i don't think China can ever do it, because when i say it, i mean harness themselves to capitalism in a way that promises like continued standard of living rising for their citizens, that can't happen in the uh in the ecological and geological context that we live in, and the thing is they know that and so that means that perhaps they're going. bend this curve towards an actual global system a global circulation with no center. and that would be them basically like cutting off their lower limbs and saying like oh the least advanced of us are just going to eat eat it and they'll say look that's terrible but what's the alternative here what's the alternative here annihilating all life on earth and because they you know there's still a soul in the party they won't do that that's the hope anyway again don't know not my problem really and again if i knew for sure. what would it make me do? it would make me try to convince you of it. and again, if you if you agreed with me, what are you going to do? again, what rather wins repeat, our discrete opinions on any individual subject can't matter, there's only the collection of our opinions, adhered to our experiences and emotions that can generate action, can generate a will to anything, a will to act, and that is not determined by what those specific things are, so it's just it. we all have to reconfigure what we mean by politics, but before that bubble burst in the late 80s, you had this huge profit bubble explode in Japan, that money had to go somewhere, so it came into American investment, that's why people freaked out partially, not only were their cars uh much more competitive than ours, when people were buying Japanese cars like crazy, but they're also buying up real estate in the United States, again the ub and flow thing, we bought. their cars, they come and buy our uh real estate, the same thing happens with arab countries and uh and America in the 1970s, it's in network, and they were buying up treasury bills during this uh high interest era, but that cheap yen had a political problem in the United States, because it was leading to or it was understood to be led to in popular culture, because here is this foreign country doing something, we can't reckon with what we're doing to ourselves, but we can reckon what a foreign country is doing to us so in this foreign country is that setting uh their yen too low so they can have more competitive vehicle prices with us because their cost of labor is lower and they can leverage that into accepting less for the car because they've undervalued their currency because they're privatizing that uh uh they're privatizing rather than adding to the public purse that productivity raise that's not fair and that they'd say uh make them revalu it and because it's a it's it's a foreign it's it's another country and because the US both parties have no interest in like disabusing the of the idea that yeah it's Japan's fault because they didn't want to fucking say yeah this is actually policies we're carrying out they said yeah they got to stop in so there's this plaza agreement that there's an agreement to bring down the cost of the yen bring down the cost of the dollar or bring up the price of the yen and bring down the price of the dollar which had just gotten way too strong in that period uh two million dollars in the US it had to it had to they had to go elsewhere. they needed more exports and so that was the hope anyway uh and this this thing this this agreement integrates Japan more fully into the finance system and it crucially makes it totally subject to American markets, it's very important uh and what they do is they end up investing a lot of this money uh in uh the auto sector in the US, like I said, they didn't just close a bunch of factories in the rust belt in in the 80s, they also opened a bunch of factories in the southwest. in the southeast in the non-union parts of the country uh that uh started putting out like hired fewer people because it was more uh highly automated uh and paid them less than union workers so it's like it's all part of the depressionary spiral on on labor but it's still you know it's investment that builds jobs just at a lower level um but this is all premised on cheap money the cheap money gets to the point of instability, they raise the rates and the whole thing pops and the Japanese economy collapses, uh, and I honestly wonder if that's not what they're hoping to do right now, I kind of think that they're looking at what happened with Japan and how yeah, you know, their economy basically collapsed uh there, but not as part of a global uh, great depression, that's important, like they're still like the lights are on elsewhere, and you know, it it it fucked them up, but still around, they're they're still - in the G7, they're still part of the team, they're on the fashion, they're on they're part of the the capitalist cycle here, they're they're moving the capital through the way it has to be, maybe we could do that here, and of course that you know overlooks the fact that uh, that the sinues of state are so fucking rickety here and the social network that allows people to uh accept something like a massive collapse in living standards uh with something approaching equamity is is is is liquidated, so it'll be very interesting to see if they're if they're if they're pulling a a Japanese. is late 80's type deal or late, early 90s, i can't remember, so for the rest of the world, well this is happening, and the financialization spleed through everything, these guys who are trying to catch up to the first world with their input substitution uh, and sometimes with the aid of the US who understood that these like if not for the communists, the threat of the communists, these states have to be structured, they have to be uh durable, that means there has to be some sort of domestic economy, so there is like a grudging support for ISIS uh and for you the larger of the post colonial countries and the developing states in Latin America to build their own economies, but when the volker shock kicks in and people call it the vulker shock now kind of to talk about the interest rates as a whole, but the vulker shock to me refers specifically to how it was felt in Latin America, because there really was a shock, in a way it wasn't anywhere else because because they had borrowed a bunch of money to do their uh to to fund their you know economies and to to keep the development system going and trying to you know develop those internal markets that are so crucial uh and they needed to do it on borrow money because they were fucking running up hill with a backpack uh and when that interest rate hits their borrowing uh ledger they all of a sudden basically go and solve it because they cannot pay the... interest rates, this basically what happened to uh the adjustable rate home owners in 19 in 2008 uh and of course the IMF is there to do there what they did in uh uh to do there what they did in England structural adjustment on the condition of the uh broke the breaking of the public sector and the end of uh trying to build sorry buddy you're not building in industry anymore except uh some of you can be a place for foreign capital to park itself uh and provide uh low wage proletarian labor for, you're not going to have any domestic industry with like a domestic uh uh distribution of profits, no no those profits come with us, you we leave you uh the the cost of maintenance and we leave you the pittence of salary we give to these people uh whose exploitation is the whole point of the operation. and that means you can't develop, you're done, everyone's done, everyone's treading water uh and been seeing the thing slowly fall apart ever since, which is of course why there's this big fucking uh, at least part of the reason why there's a large immigration problem now uh, because at the end of the chain, once we now have immunezed, realized global capitalism, global capitalism means like industrial or um some countries close to capital uh with domestic, consumer industries, all every level, a consumer economy, and a consumer economy to an extent has to have a political component, it has to have a public uh sphere of discretion, for order in order for uh the the whole cycle of uh of consumption to to generate, like you have to be seeking something, you have to be seeking something through the affirmation of choice that is elsewhere denied you, and that's that dream relies on rituals of choice, and that means you have to have a ritual of political choice, but that that ritual has real effects on like how exactly, efficiently capitalism can operate, uh, but in these in these places that got capitalism last, where where there was no development because all of the prophets were first excorporated directly for for the west in the form of imperial uh spoils. or after the end of imperialism uh extracted by the multinational corporations that came as I said and did what they later were able to do in Latin America after the the Volker shot and that created this new bipolar world where you got people at one end uh concentrating uh consuming the production of people at the other end because the actual production is at the level of resource extraction and manufacturing and shipping, that's still old fashion Deckensian Victorian capitalism, the kind that should lead to the building of durable working class political and frankly military institutions that are able to to compete uh with capitalism for power, but we have those now scattered and broken throughout a geographically diverse peripher. and then little blobs of internally geographically diverse poverty within. it's a hell of a system. I got to give him credit for it, and by him, I don't mean any of us, we're too stupid, but the real god of capital, I got to give it to him, old old Satan, I really do think it's it is, it is a real god that displaced and detrones the old God uh, for everyone, that's what I mean now, it's not, not for just believers, for everyone, uh, because even though you know you had horrifying regimes of class rule before that, you had... had notions of a holy and a sacred that had transcendent qualities that transcended any individual and that could at any time touch any individual, and I'm not just talking about Christianity, any all of the great and small religious traditions, but those feelings persist because they're human feelings, but our name for them, our names for them has now been uh, they've been drained and desacralized and turned. these empty categories that are only cynical shells for class rule and for accelerating alienation to and and surrendering of human value to an algorithm, a incantation, a spell, but you know, the apocalypse comes for all of us, but not all at once, that's the fantasy, like in early. 1600s everyone in Europe, Christian and protestant was 100% convinced that the world was about to end, and the thing is for them, the ones who died in the in the in the in the crisis of the 17th century from like 1618 to 164 like the 30 years war era and a little bit before, it it came, if you died during a village destruction by some Swedish fucking uh cavalry men or or of a resurgent plague epidemic that... that rampaged through the continent, or of a famin, which were the frequent result of of punctuated uh, crop failures caused by the little lice age, by the the climate shift, that that dropped global temperatures by two degrees centigrade. one way or another, you that death was part of a great uh tribulation, and therefore your death had the... had that architecture to it, you found out, like god's judgment, you found it, one way or the other, um, but then there's what about everybody left, what about everybody lived, it felt apocalyptic, but you know their whole lives had sucked, it was apocalyptic, and once once they survived it in retrospect, it becomes just some more stuff that happened, and the... stays on the horizon because it always has to, because they cannot reconcile their lives to their to their values, because we live under class rule, which was never overthrown by this, this convulsion, and so we have to build new structures around these terms, with and and give our feelings relationships to these these terms, and it meant that what we were worshipping the whole time, like once it comes into being, is not is not any embodiment of human. value it is an embodiment of the value of the extraction of profit, which is domination, which is separateness and difference, it's it's literally the fucking uh, it's anti-matter, and you know, it's part and parcel of life, it's built into our alienation from ourselves that is inherent to human life, you don't get rid of alienation completely, it's impossible, we're not animals, we can't, we are different animals i should say, our our capacity for reflection means that we cannot be uh unalienated the way that we imagine fantasized we could be and the way that we imagine animals are and that is always going to be there um but the question is what name do we give it and we've name we've given that that gap that that little that separation uh instead of trying to to remove it with our concepts uh we are deciding to worship it we're worshipping the void uh the separateness and all of our actions in the market reinforce that that's what those words mean because we have this roman conception of identity centered on possession, ownership, that's why the empire never ended, was correct, and i think that uh grab grow to go back to the... gone of everything, they make a convincing case for what was life, like what life was like when you know that alienation was just something that was dealt with as part of a more uh grounded and holistic politics and and religion, this is the crucial part, that that dealt with all that stuff, that didn't allow the accumulation of alienation, but again after time, over time enough trauma is going to bend things in one direction or another, and then if that trauma encounters the material to reify itself, like horses and bronze, then it's going to do so, and it's going to dominate every other form of life, because they don't have the imperative to and then the Romans are the ones who defined that most purely and built the most induring institutions and structures of that reinforce these ideas over time so that when they collapse, even though their power could no longer be extended out physically, psychologically, it was still the prevailing idea of the entire people, and everything they built after that, including their idea of Christianity was built on. top of it without knowing it, without knowing that Christ was trying to prevent that very thing from coming into being, Christ was tr was saw in a tried to stop that thing from emerging, but now built by it, molded by it, that system of values that is deeper than any name we give to it, because it it organizes our lives and our relationships with each other in ways that we can't choose. then Christianity becomes a parody of itself and Christ becomes Satan, and of course the protestants immediately decided like almost like Martin Luther starts off being kind of conciliatory toward the pope, but like as soon as the pope tells them to fuck off after uh worms, he was like, actually the pope is the antichrist, it's like, yeah, of course, of course the... the antichrist, because he represents to you everything about Christianity that corresponds to the deeper rot of the ownership uh theology that our Christianity is built on top of, but he can't see it, the experiences of life to allow him to see it and articulate it don't exist, so he has to project it onto the fucking the catholics, because if the catholics are just listen to him and read the book and come to the same conclusion as him, well then god damn it, everything would have been fine, we would have had are heaven on earth, but of course we can't have that, because these people are most powerful in society, they understand Christ as the guy who gave them all the stuff they have, so they have to project to the other and then try to destroy one another, and then when everybody's out of that, they build a new god that'... allows them to uh sublimate that conflict, like the protestants sort of have to dis things get worse, the protestants have to decide that the catholics are antichrist, right? that the pope's the antichrist, because they have to, they deal with all the horror that's happening, and they have to stop it, and this is how you stop it, kill the antichrist, but that means like actually going to war, and that's disruptive, what's much better is if that the antichrist becomes invisible, and all of the evil that we are doing becomes unspeakable, and so we imagine that that satan is this is is is this thing tempting us, when in reality satan is our is our is the shape of our actions and it's only our sublimated guilty consciousnesses that uh require this this foil to contemplate and that's why uh monotheistic religion has to at the end of the day become fascistic, it has to try to seize the state to compel, because more deeply than it believes in humans, it believes in ownership, because it is this unreconstructed, totalizing ideology that has to be stood against at its root, and the root is nothing to do with the fucking trinity, it has nothing to do with any theological question or moral question, beyond is there a transcendent right to proper. and i say no, i don't think there's any argument you can make for it that is not presposed class society, and i say we have lived out of class society before, we could live in it again, but that's because we have the capacity to seize our institutions and direct them that way, we could only do it once we had the concentrated capital capable of it, that's why the medieval peasants could not build. socialism in the crisis of the fucking 17th century, all they could do is do in uh die uh in starvations and and fammens and and uh raids by soldiers uh get killed in feudal. that they can't coordinate well enough to uh defeat like mercenary armies sent by uh rich uh princes uh they either died uh or they you know blamed it on witches that's the witch days of the 18th 1630s is the world coming to the at the seams and someone having to be blamed for it, there's also obviously a bunch of anti-jewish programs, but the height of witch mania was at the height of the fucking 30 years war and in the worst part hits of Germany, somebody had to pay for it and it couldn't be the the lord because that is an existential conflict that you can't win, some fucking old lady on the edge of town, you can beat the hell out of her, you can fucking wrap rapper, you can wrap her to a fucking stake and you can set her on fire, you can do whatever you want to. to vent the the misery of your life that doesn't involve confrontation with power, but you couldn't have because there's no structures to accommodated, the working class is always supposed to do it, the working class, wc failed in the 20th century, we are now in a situation where you cannot really talk about people as being members of a class, so we're just we're the global citizen, i guess this is some heart and negry shit, but i do think it's true uh, and we are still going to organize a long class though is the thing, because the only people are going to be alienated enough from the system to actually risk confrontation with it are those who are the fartest from capital and therefore the most the closest to real alienation and that doesn't just mean the global poor and unemployed reserve army, but also the the most hyper-exploited among laborers which still need to be there, we have not fully automated this economy by a fucking long shot. there still plenty of people even at the center of the system that have to do shitty long grouling work for low money and so and the tools exist for them to organize, it's not going to look like uh the old organization though cuz those categories have been empty to meaning we're building new ones every day and i don't know what they are, i hate having to fucking always end it that way, but it's just the mandala man, it's the western fantasy that you can straighten the mandala and just walk up it like a staircase, you got to keep going around in circles, sorry. you got to, I know it's a cop out, but you get to the top of the fucking dark tower and you open the door, you're just going to find yourself in the fucking west, chasing the red, the the chasing the man in black, and maybe you've got the el, the horn of eld in your hand this time, and maybe that'll mean something, but it's nothing that you can into it. All right, so next Tuesday we'll talk about chapters 9 and 10, which is about going to be about uh, the super hyper financialization leading up to the big collapse, and then I think they're going to talk about what's next, and I'm very interested to see how they talk about that, because the theseas of their book is that the state is inextrably linked to capital, US state has been the most important single uh institution in bringing about global capitalism, but now we're in a situation where like the demands to to equalize the flow that are that a system in crisis requires are uh running up against the fact that the US government you know has a... "the US state is now have a directly contradictory interest to that, because if they're not at the center of this thing, we're not getting the treats anymore, and the story, and the treats are the only reason any of this works. I know that's snied to say, oh treats, you're talking about things like dialysis and you know, school lunches, it's like, yeah, I know, I know, but it's a consumer economy, it means everything from things people really need to things that people don't really need at all, but psychologically, they need them." It's the it's the addiction economy and people are going to get weened off at one speed or another, and the faster they're weaned off, the more violent the response is going to be, the slower they're weened off, and and you know, and that's what the US wants to do, but they're pulling against now, they're pulling against the rains, and so what kind of equilibrium do we settle into? that's the question, I would like to ask it, and um, apparently uh, Sam Ginden, the co-author. uh has been made aware of the stream and he might come on at the end when we're done with the book and talk about that. i'd be interested to hear his thoughts. so all right, this is another long one, sorry about that. next tuesday we'll talk chapters 9 and 10, the making of global capitalism. bye-bye.
