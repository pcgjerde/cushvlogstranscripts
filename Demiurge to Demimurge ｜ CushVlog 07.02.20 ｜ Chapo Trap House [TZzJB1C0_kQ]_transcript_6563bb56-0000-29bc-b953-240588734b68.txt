 see if anybody comes over here, it's been a long time since I've done one of these, I apologize, but I got kicked off of the Twitch page, I have to be readded, and uh, I wanted to set up my laptop for that because I'm sick of the audio issues happening with my goddamn uh phone, I'm not going to be getting a new phone anytime soon. uh, because it's a hassle, so I'm going to figure out with the help of our trusted producer Chris how to set up a uh direct thing from my laptop, so until I got that set up, I was going to decide I still wanted to do a chat and so decided to do it back here on Instagram, I didn't get kicked off, it just, I think what happened is is I was like trying to get on and someone else from the FYM crew went on and it knocked me off and I have to... like do the two factor and chris our producer is moving right now and i just don't want to have to deal with it so instead i figured i would just do good old fashion instagram for now but uh we will we will be back on twitch soon i promise um let me say that when it comes to giz lane uh i was just on I was just on asan's stream with Race and whole deal so if you really want a good lane primer and react uh and check that out uh because I didn't have a lot to contribute in terms of the blame stuff because my theory of the case man she was dead I couldn't imagine a world where just laying max is alive and anything I thought I understood about the absten case mak sense, so if she's still alive, that means that there is, perhaps a factional infiting going on, something like the white hat, black hat q and on concept, only the difference is, it's all black hats, there's no white hats, there's no good guys, it's just scumbag criminals, uh, that's all we have, our awful awful pieces of shit, um, and oh good lord. did it happen again? what am i supposed to do? i i can't, i can't, i i turned it up, i turned up the volume. i don't know what else to do. how's this? how does this sound? oh, you guys need to stop doing this, because it really throws me off because i can't know how i sound, so like you can't just mess. with me and think I'm having a good time, you're having a good time, I don't know what I sound like, I don't want to waste it talking in a way that people can't understand, because I want these also to go on YouTube, and I can't do any of that if I don't know, and I can't trust that any of you people aren't giving me the business or that you're not audio files, which are the weirdest mutants on earth, and people who make it impossible for anyone to make anything that has sound because they just say, god this isn't flack or whatever the hell, bunch of Neil Young's. Can I take this out or does it just immediately ruin it? Because I hate having the headphone in. Is it okay? Is it still okay? Is it okay now? Can you hear me? Because I'd really rather not have a thing in my ear. So Jislain being alive and in fact apparently under FBI surveillance for almost a year. I mean I don't know man. I i don't what the hell i'm supposed to make out of that uh unless she's being protected by some other faction of intelligence or the elite uh who want to see some some percentage of the epstean network exposed not the whole thing of course but some chunk of it and and uh Jislaine's going to do that uh the fact that she's apparently being her case is being prosecuted by the like the public affairs division uh of the of uh of the new york uh attorney general uh justice department office, that implies that they're going after some public officials, uh, maybe maybe this is an October surprise to own the Clintons by by Trump and bar, or maybe it's a counter Trump insurgency within the justice department who are pissed about their guy getting fired uh for no reason or I guess because he was like looking at a prosecuting Giuliani uh and deciding to met with Trump, I don't know, I would be surprised if she died, not because obvious like there would be above killing her or like there'd be some worry, oh this is too far, because we know now there's no too far. just that it would have happened already, that was my assumption, i thought she was dead, the second pstein died, and apparently she's been hanging around in New Hampshire the whole time, i don't know how to process that, so uh, i'm gonna have to do a big old big old shrug, uh, so right now i'm just going to sit back and see and wait and find out what happens, i'd be very surprised if there's any sort of large scale investigation, some sort of, it could be that they brought her out to do the opposite of what i'm saying and brought. about to exonerate people, like say prince Andrew, like maybe this is all a british thing, maybe they kept her alive in case some part of the accusations didn't go away so that she could be brought in to exonerate somebody who is under the under the uh lamp like prince Andrew, possible, i have no idea doing the shrug emoji man about this lamp, i am shrugging my ass I have no idea, but there certainly is um, like there are factions within the ruling elite always even within things like the intelligence community uh, and some sort of internesing battle always was something that made sense about epstein, because I mean Epstein thought he was going to get away with it until the day before, the day he died, which makes you think that he felt uh that he was still protected even in prison when of course he wasn't. who was protecting him? were they only pretending to protect him or were they actually trying to use him for something? and then somebody got in there and gave them the old the old uh fake suicide. i i don't. i feel like i i know more and feel less confident about things as time goes on. so but that's all i have to say about jazlaine for now. i talked a little bit more on the episode we recorded today. um, but i actually want to talk about something else uh to start with, something that I talked about. about last time uh i tried to talk about yesterday but stupid twitch stream would work because i did something bad yesterday i went on twitter and i engaged which i actually very rarely do because it's that's not where twitter's for twitter's for having fun with your friends but something you just hit me wrong and i felt the need to engage and of course it was waste of time in the sense that nothing was advanced no one learned anything but i do feel like i le something or at least I learned like I could explain something a little better that I thought beforehand and when it was was Chris Hays tweeted something about how my mom never let me watch the Dukes of Hazard because she thought that the flag was racist gay mom and it just hit me wrong it was not Grill Pill to respond I agree but I'm not a perfect being I will fail every day trying to be... uh, you know, a a a mature person, because none of us are, you know, and and there are too many, there's so many uh, seductions and I tried to compartmentalize, but like I said, I feel like this was instructive anyway, so I look on it as uh, even though it was a mistake, hey, turn that mistake into a miracle, and obviously I'm already kind of annoyed, I've been annoyed with Christ for a long time, specifically the way that he spent the early months of Corona just freaking out about Trump's inadequacy of a response. while not saying a word about uh about Joe Biden and the Democratic party insisting on carrying out uh primaries that got people killed definitively say a word about it cuz he's but anyway that tweet was just so nausiating to me because it like what was the point of it like what does he really think he's saying there other than my mom is one of the good ones. like is he saying my mom is a good white, is that what he's saying? so i just asked him, not challenging him, not insulting and i just said, do you really think that you would be more racist if you'd watched duce of hazard, growing up in what? he grew up in New York City, he went to a magnet high school with immortal technique at desus and marrow, you really think if you'd seen the general lee 30 minutes a week, you'd be more racist, and so i just asked him. he never responded, but instead, gek here, everyone's favorite internet pedant, the man one of the people who have been, one of those people who are trapped in the cave of online discourse, the kind of people who, if you did the the play-doh allegory thing and went up and saw the real light and came in and tried to get them away from the fire, they would punch and kick you, because it's to them that's the only world they live in is the internet, and his hilarious asked question to me was, do you think web deboys is a lid? and uh, I asked him if he was smelling toast, it was baffling to me, but it started this whole tedious argument that I did not participate in for the most part and ignored. uh about the role of cultural reproduction in maintaining and uh systemic racial oppression and Jeet's half of a point was that marxist tradition black marxist tradition has plenty to talk about the way the culture reinforces racism and it really struck me like how online discourse maybe all discourse but certainly the kind I'm familiar with online really isn't possible because I of course, no one reasonable, he called me a glist, that's like, no one reasonable doesn't agree that culture reinforces racial discrimination, of course it does, culture is where people live, that's the level that people live at, of course that what does it, and so yeah, things like the confederate flag or or racial tropes or whatever, they reinforce racial ideas that then people act on, that's true, but right now, in this moment, right, all this talk about like Dukes of Hazard, yes or no, it's a context of this cultural uh, this sort of minicultural revolution, right that we're doing right now, uh, getting rid of episodes that have black face from old shows, renaming things, pulling down statues, and there is a current of thought that I think is wrong, that says that because these things are doing, because these things are happening, because there's um, because there's this corporate attempt to uh uh to to nullify and neutralize the protest movement by doing things like hey we're taking the name off and hey we're getting rid of this episode and hey this actor is not going to this white actor is not going to do this black character anymore that that is proof that the entire movement is some sort of like neoliberal plot which i mean if you unless you want to put George Soros in there that doesn't make any sense uh because you're ignoring the fact that cultural production, the culture that is created by corporations, which is basically all the ones we know, that exists to try to co-op and neutralize all social movements, that's what they do, this is an attempt, and the fact that they're doing it only means they feel they have to, which is an indication that there is a potential for power, right? that's why there's an attempt to molify, because there is a potential for power. Well, the question is, how is that potential going to be filled? The corporate answer from above is, what if we get rid of these bad episodes of TV, what if we take our names off this thing, what if we cleanse the cultural palace, so you don't see things that remind you of racial discrimination, racial hierarchy, huh? how about that? and people, individually, the people who are in in line with this protest movement, and who do things like supported material. through money and participation specifically in protest and continual civil disobedience, what is going to mallify them, what is going to make them say, we've got something, is it going to be this stuff or is it going to be a significant redistribution of wealth that has been unjustly malaportion towards white people over the history of America and through a disparity that is reproduced by capitalism over time, which are those are. going to confront, it's going to be very difficult to get to material conditions because we don't have deliberative bodies, we don't have an organization, I mean I said this a million times and it's still true, something might emerge, but it hasn't yet, that makes it hard to focus on material conditions, it's much easier to just choose to accept or not accept things passively like the removal of an episode of a television show or the changing of the name of something, and in my opinion it is vitally important to rese that to say that is not going to do it, that is not enough, and anybody who is this moment arguing the trivially true, but irrelevant point, that well, cultural stuff does reproduce racism, sure, but we're not talking about what reproduces racism right now, we're talking about what makes it happen, like the actual motivator, the actual thing that generates racial discrimination, generates racial disparity in experience of being an American, it is the resources, it is the failure to include black people in the the the the the the treasure, the the festival of of wealth of the post war era, and now because our systems are not redistributive, they're redistributive upward, that has only been reproduced over time, now the culture is getting less racist right, because because of the 60's and because of the change in cultural perception, and more important, most importantly, the change of the way that culture is taught to us through things like television and education, specifically college. where post war everybody went to college essentially got a a social um eticat class, that's what that's what college is really about, college the ed the information unless it's technical and there is even that much technical stuff in a technical degree, what you're really learning is manners, how to comport yourself among the bourgeois, and that is what gets you into the bourgeois, that little piece of paper says i am. of someone who has these values and those values have gone left now the reason for that is because conditions have only gotten worse, conditions have only gotten worse and there's a bunch of liberals who tend to have disproportionate control of cultural levers who don't like that fact and it makes them feel bad, it makes them sad, but of course they're not going to change anything, they're liberals, right? liberals mean you can't really change anything, oh i'll i'll pay a little bit more tax, but i'm not going to rip up the foundations of this like uh cases. because it's fundamentally capitalism, you would, you would to to do the kind of redistribution that would be required and would be just, you would have to abolish the ruling class to redistribute, they don't want that to be done, they are the ruling class, what they want is to feel less bad about how it's still bad to be black in this country, so they want the culture to be more egalitarian, they want it to be more racial anti-racist, anti, not even color anti-racist, but that's but it has happened, we've gotten less racist while the conditions have only gotten worse, so all these people who say, this isn't nothing, this is a real, this is a real gain, we should really be pursuing this. the culture has gotten so much less racist in the last four years and yet conditions relax in this country have staltified, and in pat since the uh uh, since the 2008 crisis gotten worse over time, so we know that because what happens is you mow the lawn right? you get rid of racial symbol racist symbolism and culture, you reduce racist ideas and it works too. people are more open-minded in America than they used to be, they are more accepting of the races, genders and stuff like that in in broad opinion polls. broadly, it's true. uh, but if you don't change the conditions in a country where you think you are participating in a democracy and you're participating in a just rule a just order, why? is there this disparity still? how do you explain it? and for the ruling class to reproduces this culture, they're never going to be interested in the material explanation because that will undermine their position. it becomes a question then of what's wrong with black people. and liberals can say, oh, there is still material conditions that are different, and there is still real, but they don't have a prescription for it, so it's impotent. If you're not a liberal, the answer is obvious, they they can't do any better, they're imperior, buse why else would they? I live in a just country, I haven't live in a democracy, I live in a country where every government is pursuing what is we broadly consider to be the good, why would this disparity still exist, and so what you create is this ball of racial, white racial anxiety, frailty if you will, or fragility that is: express through either uh guilt or hatred, some combination of both, but here's the beauty part, it's a combination of both and everyone, so the most anti-racist white people person, his ball of guilt is marbled through with hate, and even the most racist black uh white person, his um his ball of guilt or his ball of hate is marbled through with guilt too, to some degre everyone is this, and here's the thing, those are both negative of feel. and emotions, you don't like feeling either of them, now has this sick perverted uh fucking uh, pin head from hellrazer purification of pain theory that you should be holding anxiety and guilt in your head at all times when you're dealing with the right person, and if that's good, well, for some people like getting their car, car batteries attached to their nipples, most people don't, most people are going to then avoid subconsciously black people because they don't want to feel guilty. and then the racist who hates more, he doesn't want to interact with black people buse it rises his hatred, and that that phenomenon will exist as long as the disparity in in material conditions exist, you can mow the lawn, but it'll grow back, but if you abolish the disparity, which is possible, which is honestly, if you socialize an economy, the size of Americas is trivially possible, not in would become self uh self perpetuating over time and that is possible with a socialist uh approach to government with the abolition of the ruling class, the abolition of property uh as as it's understood in marxism, the abolition of hoarded wealth, the social reproduction, use value, you would not get rid of racism, but you would get rid of racial disparity, the majority of... disparity, the experience of being black in this country would persist in being uh less fun, being alienating, more alienating than being white, because there's going to be lingering feelings, because that that because the culture comes afterwards, the culture always comes afterwards, it's the super structure, so it will take time to for those thoughts for that to diffuse, but it will, and guess what, all those confederate flags will come down, all those statues will come down, because nobody's going to want to keep. up anymore or not enough people are, but what G is insisting on and what Hays is insisting on is, no, no, let's get people used to the idea that this cultural change is sufficient, when we know it isn't, you mow that lawn and the fucking grass is going to grow again because you haven't done anything about the material disparity, you might make it easier for some small segment of black people to go farther. than they would have, because maybe maybe we have increased affirmative action as part of this, or more divers, greater diversity in hollywood, right? so that means there's a lot of more black people getting getting high-paid media jobs that and then that money filters in the community, maybe, but this is just around the edges, and so that's why anybody who's making that point right now is doing the work, not only of the ruling class that's trying to co-op and neutralize this. movement, but also all of those class first reductionist stupid pall people that you all hate, right? the people that the GTers of the world hate more than anyone, way more than Trump people, the stupid class first reductionist sons of bitches, oh i hate them so much, well guess what, you're doing their work for them by giving them a living example of you settling for cultural change at the expense of momentum towards material change, and you validated their argument, so you're you're you're doing the work of all of the malefactors both in your little hot house of internet commentary and and and thought such that it exists to the highest levels of of of the cultural wing of our ruling capitalist overlors. it is pronounced to boys, yes. so that is as they say, that on that. And then there was one other thing I wanted to say yesterday that I couldn't, I wanted to get it out over with here, and that is that I wanted to follow up a little bit on the demirds that we talked about uh the other day about what the demir is in gnostic Christianity and how it relates to uh the material world we live in. I said that the crisis, the the spiritual crisis that provokes nasticism in the in the in the uh gnostic is the inability to live as a Christian in the world he finds himself in because of the demirge shaping it in a way that binds us to conditions material conditions that pull us away from God, mainly greed and pain, are our greed and that which puts us over others and dominion over others, and then the pain of being oppressed, both of which are not good for spiritual pursuit, and you have a guy who told everyone, live in common and and and because what is wealth, it is meaningless, what is physical pleasure, it is meaningless, but physical pleasure and wealth are all this world worships, how is it, how are you supposed to live in that world? how are you supposed to live in that world? the explanation was an evil demon came in and created this thing and trapped us and it's our job to fight through, it's a beautiful narrative, it makes us look at the adventure hero, we're we're the fucking guy from pitfall, uh, but what i didn't really get into is that so i was, i said that that is our condition as human. that we live in a demirgical reality, we are actually all human beings and part of the same species being that could and should be working as one consciousness with the same singularity of purpose as an individual consciousness, that is a class, and then a species coming into itself, consciousness of itself, that's that should be the goal of all human endever, and instead the world is split into fractuus. groups that are all delusionally believing that they're at war with each other when they're actually serving the interest of an even smaller group of vampires of demons who are draining them of their life blood, well they struggle through lives of ignorance and pain where they never feel a the touch of the divine, but the question, i didn't really answer is well, what is the demi-urge now? i said we are the ones who created it, but what is what is the demirgical reality? so the spiritual world, the world where we could be operating consciously, is one of material abundance, is the one of a environment that by definition can be lived in a state of homeostatic harmony with any species on it, that can persist, and we could, we could be a homeostatically inmeshed and not in like a stupid, like not even not in a dumb, ancap way, or no, not ancap, anarcho-primitivist way, the dumb ass anarcho primitive argument, oh we just need to get back to the hunter gatherer thing, now because because the reason you know that, you know the reason i know that, because we are here now, and we started there, and we got here, which means it doesn't work, you're basically saying, let's try again, no, no, no, you work through the steps, like if we, if we were able to harness technology to bring us in harmony with our fucking natural surroundings, we would be able to live the sort of life that they imagine those those, those noble savages did. with uh clean water uh high uh low low infant mortality rates, low to nonexistent mortality rates uh basically life less terrified and there and a life more connected to others, a life more conscious, we can have that, but struggling there is almost impossible because we find ourselves bound in a the space has been defined for us, like this land is here, like i'm on the western edge of long island, right? uh, that's real land, and like the things that the the the wood that built this house, the bricks, that was all part of the land, that was all part of the fora, that's all real, but it's here, like in this exper paraded place, land a piece of like lapan lenape, i think, indian land, in this building that is owned by a holding company in Florida in which I rent the the I rent give them money give those people money for the for the right to live in their house without getting shot basically uh that is the demical reality like the regime of private property and the commodity fetishism that we are locked in that's as much of a as a tomb that's as much of a tomb as the nastic concept of our bodies. being tubes for our spirit, we are we are our our collective spirit, our collective guist, our humans uh consciousness is as trapped in in the in the dead flesh of capitalism as the the godly spirit that the gnostics imagine was in all humans was trapped in the dead flesh with the demo airge pressed down upon us. and there's another cool uh concept from nosticism that I use that I think is useful and that is Arkans or Archans i never really know how to pronounce the ch there uh but Archons I'll go with that uh were demonic entities that were essentially the handmaidens the the minions the bureaucrats the middle-level bureaucrats the paper pushers uh of the demirers of the of the head evil demon that did his will and shaped and kept spirits from from pushing through, we're there basically with wacamoles to smack everyone down before they could get to god, that's what they're there for, and they also form together, there's seven of them i think, and they deform together one big evil demon, so it's like a fucking voltron, and I feel like that is another concept that has an analog in the material world, the material, late capitalist world we find ourselves and that is uh, that there are some people in this world who have so fully. the values, the perverse and and anti-human values that are part and parcel of this demirgical reality, so fully that they are able to intuitit its will and do its bitting, those of course are the people of power in this world, bohemian groove types, the high elites, like because of the mostly the the fact that they're so born so close to power to begin with that they have access to it at an intimate level. but then also through the the systematic stripping away through nature and nurture and learned behavior of conscience of of basic human uh love of the god. spirit of the of the universal loving kindliness that is instinctive among all human beings severing those in pursuit of a dead of worship of death of worship of disconnection and extinguishment and those people are have the function of demons, they're functionally demons, so that's another thing where Alex Jones, not totally... off the beam and his concept of the our rulers as demons is is poetically and i i'd say even metaphysically accurate like trump is a fucking archon but i would say that like if the archons like if you put on they live glasses and instead of people you saw demons like big demons with fucking giant cod pieces and huge wings but they were bigger the like the higher up they were and pony in ranks, Trump wouldn't be that big of a demon compared to some of the other people who held that office and people in power right now, like I think Seth Minuchen's probably a bigger demon than Trump, that is a umbrella, it's not a KKK man, yucky yuck yuck, yeah, see, I've always been very uh, I've always been very conflicted about. the usefulness of conspiracy theory in left organizing and left thought, because it is instinctively the way people think, it's how you fill in the gaps, how you filling the gaps in your in your uh, in the in the information you have, which for all of us is very very small amount compared to what's actually happening in the world, our ability to orientate our 12s is is uh facilitated by how we're able to fill in gaps as things occur, create a narrative that makes sense to us and so we end up throwing shit we hear for the internet mostly from culture. and tv and stuff and throwing it back out there, and the thing is, because the the funny thing is is that because the culture right, is as i have said, comes from the economic base, right? it's it's not generative, it is generated, guess what, if you're filling in the gaps of your knowledge with narrative and conspiracy theory, it's going to reflect a lot of true shit, because culture is reflected truly in our uh or or or um like our ideology is truly projected in our culture, it's just reflected so that all the bad qualities are turned into good qualities, like we can sexual we context, culture contextualizes the reality of our physical horror, and reorients it to reflect back to us in reverse, where all the bad stuff that is really felt by us is turned into theoretical, cultural, uh, superstructural good stuff. and then we live at the level of that stuff to and that's what we use to make ourselves okay with the bad stuff to rationalize the bad stuff so that we continue maintaining fidelity to the system, that is how it may that's how it does ideological oppression on people, that's how it keeps people playing, that's how it manufactures consent, it creates a culture where it it acknowledges all the horrors of your... life, but it puts them through a a symbolic narrative lens that flips them and makes the bad things good, but then you're getting it back in the form of conspiracy theory, it's been flipped again, it's reapplied to the real world and it flips back, so there is usefulness to it, the problem is is that you're not everyone assimulates to culture the same way, and that's the main problem with this mechanistic argument about how oh if we reduce this cultural element like the confederate flag or non-black judges on law and order, it will make people do this, you can't predict what people will do with information they get from culture, it's different with every person, even if it's not a different response, the depth of the response is different for everyone, just like a fingerprint, it's a cultural fingerprint, and that is why there's there's always something stupid about the argument about whether culture makes people do things in the 80's it was a remember guys in the 90s some of you are too young but in the 90s it was about violence and it was about does does consuming violent entertainment make you violent and the left response was no that's silly that's that's ridiculous now it's does the culture make you racist and the left argument is of course it does in both cases the answer to that is yes in the proximate case like john Hinkly Jr. could be said accurately to have shot. the uh um uh to have shot Regan because he watched taxi driving like that is that is a legible sequence of actions that has a surface plausibility to it. "the guy had then no idea who jody Foster was until he saw that movie, and seeing her in relationship to the heroism of de Nero makes him snap two and two together, and then that turns into because of other old information and taxi driver, I'm going to shoot the president, now the thing is though, from that is only describing the mere action action, that's the mechanism, you can't draw from that, from any specific thing like that, a general theory of what to do." like actually how to practically deal with that, because uh, it's too individualized, it's not worth it to ban taxi driver to stop someone from shooting the president, because he's probably the only guy on earth would have had that response, because he was already set up to snap. the answer to this stuff is that culture gives someone an excuse, it's gives them a little final push, but the thing is. It's un, it's completely unpredictable from one person to another, it's stastic, so you can't use blanket condemnations, you can't use big flip, especially ones that seriously undermine free speech and alienate people from the government that you represent, you're trying to have popular support for these measures, and I'm sorry, in America, especially calls for censorship, makes some people mad, even if they're not trying to defend racism, that is a social cause. and then you have the social cost of that thing not being able to be artistically pursued, which is a loss for all of us, to stop what, maybe one or two guys wanting to try to shoot the president, it's not worth it, you have to change the physical conditions, you have to change the material conditions to minimize the number of people are going to snap, the number of people are going to do anything from commit a murder to act out on racial beliefs, you want someone who's going to be racist, you want them to have the racism at like a three, you can live in a and that's where culture can play a role to bring that number down and so this whole argument about oh these things have negative effects it's all assumed because you're talking about an individual moment but you're applying it to an entire group of people and can't work, it's too flimsy, that's why you have to always be oriented when it comes to prescriptions to the material, and this is where this is the meaningful distinction I'm talking about, this is the real meaningful distinction I'm talking about, you can say that it is correct, like when Jeet says, cultural racism reinforces material felt racism, you can say that and be correct, but that is at the level of... description describing a situation, it is not prescription saying what to do about it, but every all of those distinctions are lost online and the debate is flattened, and they both become dimensions of the same question, and they're not, they have to be separated, and so my my mind is because of that, don't even argue about any of the don't argue about these things, don't waste breath on either defending or condemning. flag cancel culture, statue cancellations or or the role of of uh of woke capital in the protest, don't even argue about it, because I said as I said the other day, even you arguing about it contributes to the cycle, because it gives someone the something to argue against, just focus on the material conditions, and the thing is, everyone's having this fun argument about the descriptive question, and you want to be part of the fun party, you can hear them on the other side of the fence, your neighbors, having a great. barbecue over there, you yelling at each other, they're having the time of their lives, forming friendships and hatreds that are going to last forever. you're over here scribbling away in the blue books like fucking marks in the in the British museum, they're over there playing fucking nude softball, i'm in volleyball, both whatever at the same time, so i understand the lure of it, but it just contributes to the it just contributes to it, grilll as in stay grounded. and and most of all take what you know to be true about the material roots of racism and the need to attack it materially if you're going to do anything about it and apply it to your actual life. how about that? and you can say, i don't know how, well then wait, move forward, one foot in front of the other until a movement, a direction makes sense, but don't panic and try to skip steps by formulating. online by expressing yourself online emotionally and getting your sense of a purpose build there because guess what, it will lure you in like narciss. this reflection, if you don't have an answer, keep grilling, if you don't have answer, keep doing whatever is in your life that you feel good about doing, that you feel like you're constructing something, and then there will be an intersection with the question of the political, and then you can apply that, so that is what I say to everybody who's getting all hot and bothered about any of this stuff. like if you're protesting, if you're out there, keep doing it, if you're organizing, keep doing it, if you're not yet, then apply the the that that rubric of like what satisfies me and what am i good at, and actually apply it to the question, instead of getting theoretical, ah that felt good, got a lot off my chest there. It was bad because I was all ready yesterday to go and then it was like sorry, I don't like coughing on the thing, that's why I take the smaller pups, I know, I don't like coughing, grow your own food if you can, is good advice for anybody, becoming self-sufficient in any way you can is probably not a bad idea, and you know what, makes it... easier to be self-sufficient having other people cooperating. i know it's hard because we're living we're living through a a a a a um pandemic that has ex uh made every current of alienation in this culture exacerbated. that's a bummer man, that that's a real bummer. i know i i i i uh, i remember with instagram you only get an hour, i don't know how long i've gone if anybody has a clock, so i know not to get too wound up into like another thing if it's gonna cut me off, i prefer on twitch how uh you can go as long as you want, what kind of time we got guys anyone anyone got time? 10 minutes left, so it's been 50. okay, all right, well then I'll just uh, maybe ask a couple, answer a couple questions before I log off here, the question of the statues helping moment, helping uh give people momentum, as I've said, uh, it's only if the momentum is towards something useful, if pushing down a small statue makes you get it in your head that now we can push down a bigger statue and it just becomes a question. bigger symbols, you'll never get anywhere, but that's a question of how individual protest movements that are not organized, respond, and that's why it's not a question of description, it's not a prescriptive question for me, I can't, I can't apply a prescriptive lens to it, because it's not being organized, I can't contribute to its organization, so I can only describe it and say, this is happening, and look for something that is, that is prescriptive and that can motivate me, that's that's that's what I have to wait for, that's what we all have to wait for. uh, I hope Aaron Rogers retires as a packer, I mean they ruin, they they cost, they absolutely cost him at least two super bowls in my opinion, that hack fraud uh, absolute clown mike mccarthy, one of the one of the most dreadful, probably my most hated packer quarter quarter, packer coach of all time, just an absolute worm man, just a... snivelling little purd, risk averse philistine, he didn't realize the fucking gift he had in front of him, the glorious arm of this man, god the game it the seahawks, the seahawks uh playoff game when they fucking punted or went for field goals at fourth and within like i think the 10-yard line, fourth and within the 10-yard line they went for phiel goals twice in the opening half and then they end up losing by a feel goal and that husky look, i don't want to get abelist here, but he just looked like he was a fat middle schooler, he looked like a hus a guy in a kitten ashga pagash, like wandered away like like an extra big kid, you know like it's like he got an early hit of hormones and it's like sixth grade and he's like like Andy Reid looked in the punch pack and kick uh video we did, just stumbles away. from a field trip wearing his overalls and just picks up a mic and a clipboard, so they wasted years of his prime with with that oath and now it's like the poison relation. he's been fighting him, i could definitely think i the thing is, i think especially if you get one and this is what happened with farv, you get towards the end, it's like, give me one more, and they'll do anything to get the one more, that's all they care about, and it's a question, it's honestly it comes down to growth, like if you're a real adult, if you're if you're a enlightened being, you stop playing football as soon honestly as it's financially viable because it's dangerous, but if you you get a spiritual pleasure and it makes you a better person to be a football player and it's going to be harder to be one without it and you know that, play until you reach some sort of equilibrium, these guys getting into their 40s demanding to keep playing, it's because they're chasing something, they're trying to fill a hole to can't be filled, but like that last one's going to make them feel good for a week and then they're going to be they're going to have to retire and then they're not going to know who they are, that's why the guys who walk away from the game are the ones i respect the most, barry sanders without a ring without even sniffing a ring. thanks to the packers killing them in basically every playoff game uh pretty hilarious there uh a guy whose career was completely wasted and uh but he was like i don't want to do this anymore i'm gna move to london to hang out with my daughter adore amazing bo jackson he was cut down in his prime but then he didn't like spiral he he just like well that was fun now i'm done with it i'm going to make my own arrow heads in bow awesome ricky williams they said weed or football and he thought of he said weed, i'd rather like open a headshop than get my skull caved in, so it depends on how mature Rogers is, if he walks away then i will respect him more, i will say that uh, and if he feels the need to like try to sign on with like oh god like the uh try to think of who they might go for where where he might like desperately let the packers or not i'm sorry uh the... Vikings again, the bears i don't even know who he could go to as like a as the quarterback position is actually kind of, I don't know, but if he does that it feels like he has some growing up to do, he has some maturity to do, he has some inward looking to do to realize the limits of pleasure like that, uh, that's how you know that Tom Brady is a broken hollow man, the fact that this guy has seven super bowls and he's going to go to... Tampa bay, he has a sickness, he has a sickness of the soul that will carry him to death, unless he realizes the hollowness of his pursuit. All right guys, that's been a good one, I think, uh, I hope I can get it onto the YouTube page within a few days, so catch you guys on the flappity flop doodle, go pack.
