 want to get the the punters too riled up twitch.com love and charish you twitch.com twitch and twitch you reach out to me. reach out to me, got to go boost this on the bird website for maximum eyeballs, got to move this merchandise of the words coming out of my face, we got to move these refrigerators, we got to install color tvs. Today we are having a uh razranberry lecrois, not my preferred, my preferred is the heart as the uh black cherry polar, number one goat, uh, sadly it's rarely available at my grocery store, so I end up getting whatever I can, I say cherry over any other thing else, then berry over anything else, then watermelon and then any of the raspberry cranberry type things. Yes, I believe that the goat, the goat of the flavors is the black cherry, it it's cuts through, it's efficient and it's delivery of a of a sous of of juicines in an otherwise calorically deprived beverage. All right, so today we speak not of fiszy beverages. Today we speak of carence, sing to me, oh muse, of carence, I know that the the meme is well dead by now, but I just thought it was useful to make a point about the whole current phenomenon in reference specifically to the recent blatant attempt by the president and his minions to ensure that there is not an accurate count of absenty and mail in ballots in the November election. so obviously Karen is now quite a warn topic of conversation, no one uses it anymore as a term other than people who are five who are always behind the times, not the not the internet literati, no one would be, no one watching this stream would be so gosh and so uh behind the times is to non-ironically uh a letter carren loose in in public. but for a while there, my god, everyone grabbed it, they loved it, oh god, they were so happy, it was just a perfect explanatory concept, a way to take all criticism, a way to take all things you don't like, categorize them, very very efficient uh, and therefore very useful, and so people loved it, and you can talk about how it's a lot of sublimated uh, hostility towards women, you know, like misoggyny on the... left translated towards women that are acceptable to not to not be to hate because they're uh doing like class-based oppression or something when really you're dealing with misoginy, i think that's part of it, but i honestly think that the bigger thing that drove the car and phenomenon much bigger than even the the the suppress misogeny that it did express in my opinion, was the fact that a lot of things like that, a lot of those terms of abuse that get turned into categories of people that can be immediately dismissed and and given you two minutes hate about and stereotyped and and all that uh are that our expressions of the thing that the person themselves is afraid they are, and people are terrif, and you'll see on the the left side of the internet, the number one epitheth uh is liberal, because everyone is terrified that deep down the... liberal because they don't really know why they believe what they believe, most people don't, most of us are only tenuously uh uh uh confident about any of the propositions that we carry around in our head, we mostly keep to them because the social formations that we prefer uh express them, and then we want to be part of that, and we're expressing something, we're not really believing it in any kind of depth, and so that makes us all worry, oh god, like where am i wrong, where's my liberalism, and uh, and the fact that you have to engage with things like mass media, and uh and electoral politics and the fact that real like gorilla style a conflict with the state is not something anybody feels would be worth doing that. that creates this anxiety around am i really a liberal and so you have to call everyone else liberal. same thing with Karen, everyone is afraid deep down that they're caring and so they have to get someone else to call the Karen and to yell at, and that's because we are a nation of carins in the specific respect that our only recourse on all issues, especially politics is to ask to speak to a manager, to have to, it is to make a request. of some other power to fix our current predicament, to resolve the contradiction that we are currently being emeshed with, and that we are battling. whatever that contradiction is, whatever that social political reality, that that logger head is, we are instead of embracing our own uh will, political will, and trying to change it ourselves, we are asking to speak to a manager to have someone else fix it. and you see that, i i can't, and i i've been guilty of this my whole life too, of course, i think, i'm not saying this is a point of finger to anyone, i'm saying that this is how we are conditioned to respond to all things, especially politics, to be customers, we are customers, the state is the service, government is the service, we are customers, uh, just like everything else in every other relationship, we are customers first, that's how we've been able to subsume class so far by redefining Americans away from being workers to being customers, if you're the one getting the the the uh actual, if you're the one being served in any situation, even if you work for a wage, even if you are exploited at your job, even if your late wages have been stagned for 40 years, you still are uh a customer, and that is it it defeats class consciousness uh, and it leaves us bereft of anything to do during any conflict in any political question, but ask someone else to fix it, because we don't know how to fix anything because we're not workers, we're not in a relationship to a means of production that we could collectively interfere with. withdraw our labor from, cease to allow to function, we are customers and all a customer ever has is their voice, all a customer ever has is their willingness to make a scene, and that's i mean you could say that that's the whole of politics right now, even on the the left, even among people who would rather die than think of themselves as a liberal or a Karen, what they're essentially doing is asking to speak to a manager, we're all doing that, every tweet that says reminder, uh, this is all messed up, it's like who are you talking? to, you're asking someone else to do it. today, swear to god, as if to prove my fucking thesis, there was a trending topic around the liberal freak out, the liberal dawning of recognition that he could steal the election just by not counting bailin votes, about the post office, they're just they're literally taking out machines account ballots, i mean they're just doing it in front of everyone, and then Trump says that they're going to do it because we don't want them to vote, we don't want their votes to count, it's it's there's no hiding it, it's it's out there and yet this this is the thing that you would reveal in a movie and that just the the fact of revealing it is would stop it and yet we're at the end of that movie and then no one's doing anything and the trending talk was do something who the fuck are we asking to do something congress each other? we have no idea where the levels of power are because we don't recognize that they're actually the only ones that matter are within us acting in concert using our power our labor collective labor power. and our organization along those lines to refuse to allow the system to continue to to function, anything less is an appeal to the manager, and so I have this vision where Trump loses by like 15 million votes, but in in a handful of swights that would have given him, that would have given Biden the electoral college win, uh, the ballots just don't go anywhere, they're just they're thrown out in court or something, some'. year old judge uh that just got appointed, a fucking zigot in a little a a a fetus in a in a black robe with a tiny little gavel comes out and goes, yeah these ballots are bad, what are people going to do, they're going to wait for somebody else to do something, and we're going to watch the whole thing happen and there's going to be no one, and that's going to be, if that doesn't happen, that process is a is a... a eruption of this of the subliminal action that's been going on over the past 40 years as the safety net has been destroyed as crisis capitalism has ripped out the foundations of society and replaced it with nothing with fucking opiots and uh and uh and tick tock and vapes and uh and uh constant soul death is that people have been waiting for someone to do something and it never arose and one of the big reasons nobody ever did anything is because there was always the appeal to the electoral process. "this sucks, but the only real way, the only realistic way we can organize against it is at the ballot box, we don't have enough social cohesion to do something like have a general strike, we don't have a so, we do not have the social" networks that could sustain that or coordinate it, but we do have enough of a social network to coordinate enough to vote for someone to represent us get into power and prevent the bad things are happening and maybe do good things, and the thing is is that that's not an entirely insincere or uh false argument, like in the absence of a real organized left, electoral politics has to be a scene of struggle because it's the only one we have, it's the only place where there's a level of participation and and social coordination that can be in any way influenced, everything else is too, is too flausy, it's it's it's just water flowing out, getting uncaught by the bucket, and so there was always, oh things are getting bad, but we can vote, and this time, even more than 2000, i mean 2000 was a theft, but it was it was a slow-motion theft and all the forms were observed, here months before the election, you have them saying explicitly, we are going to make it so that these votes don't count. "we are going to make it so that we can swing this election on our front, why would we want to let them sort the sort the ballots? that means the people will be able to count the ballots, he said that, so the last layer, the last layer of justification and the highest level of uh of like political uh spectacle has now lost its ability to serve as a shield, to serve as a screen for what's really going on is what's what it's there for, it's superstructural, the superstructures exist to obscure the..." reality of the social relationship, to mystify it, and now the last bastion of it will have been made there translucent with no response, why? because the social uh cohesion, the social fabric necessary, the class uh culture, the organic working class culture, necessary to resist it, has been destroyed, never really built up enough in this country anyway, in the first place, but even brought down from that level to a point where it cannot respond. to even even the last illusory notions of participatory democracy being replaced by the full acknowledged overrule of minority uh oligarchy. but again, i have no idea what's going to happen, shruggy emoji, i always have to end all of these rants and and cosmic visits. visions visions with an uh with a stipulation that hey i didn't know fucking Trump was going to win the first time i don't know anything and i sure shit don't know uh i don't know what of the million of things that could happen in terms of the intersection of Trump's ham cackhanded attempts to rig the election and like the real like nature of his declining uh political constituency and the reality of a of a of a... president presiding over depressionare economic conditions, it's such it, there's so many variables dude, it's a fucking, i mean as always the worst outcome is the most predictable, as it has been so far, the worst outcome has been what's come true basically at every level, we even got the boringest vice presidential candidate with the less, you can with us jokes, my god. I mean obviously the easy thing to say because it's the most likely to be true and it's easiest to predict is that instead of having some sort of collapse, epic collapses institutions and and then break up of of governance and and the world market, you'll have a steady and slow subsumption of all into that market uh and then it will not be without disruptions that could be called apocalyptic, but the thing is is that they will be because of our heart. normalized reality instantly metabolized into the the substance of of uh existence so they are not perceived by those who survive them anyway they are not perceived as apocalyptic because they are turned into they're turned into oh that's what it's think like now oh this is how things are now oh this is the thing and so at no point will there be that break that we're all praying for secretly that since the 90s we've been ritually trying to bring about like evo shandor and the fucking ghostbusters building trying to bring in energies to crack open the fucking veil between us and reality because we cannot bear this this this tadrian empty spectacle any longer this disgusting dance of macabra across across a dead landscape of fucking mini malls and and uh concrete and and a reified uh market system that destroys all human autonomy and and spiritual meaning. and everything that happens that makes it worse will just be another thing that now is part of it, like if you talk if you like the the American workplace, like the gig economy reality of working in America would look... like some sort of post-apocalyptic neo-feudal imposition on people in the high modernist uh uh main uh high point of American history, I mean look at what's going to happen with climate change, not an apocalypse, slow and steady consumption, like Florida, Florida is going to go away bit by bit, Miami's going to go away and it's just going to be yeah, well Miami, I mean come on, what was it doing there? not realist, not very realistic dummies uh, and then the rest of it will go, and that's just the way things are, and this is going to cause mass despoilation of life, mass death, billions of death, baby, depending on how it shakes up, but those dead, those who die will not be part of the narrative of civilization, they will be those un people, so society will not have broken down even as huge chunks of it no longer function, they will just be gangrous limbs cut off from the... world market and within the cocoon, within the remaining cocoon, things will be kind of the same, only worse every day, until we've been subsumed into this massive neural network, this this high mind of capitalism where we are all individual transistors, and the thing is is that the search for uh for like communism, the the pursuit of pursuit of socialized production at the at at this point of... capitalist like productive capacity, that isn't the challenge to turn the human race into one collective consciousness, that is itself, that is all of it, that is additive, that is all human minds together, as opposed to what capitalism seeks, which is to subsume all of what makes us human out of humanity and turn us into pure non-conscious stimulus response transmission vectors. so we're going to be part of one big network brain, the fucking nationalists who talk about how you know what uh uh uh we need the nation say yes yes you have to deal with nationalism in the reality in in the here and now but i'm talking about at a pure at a purely theoretical level nationalism is absurdity uh and it will not sustain human life it will have to be done away with now that doesn't mean you can walk around in 2020 telling Americans that America sucks because they're not going to have it. because they haven't gone to the same class as you have, but I do think that that's different than saying that it's inherently good, but I'm saying it's going to go away one way or the other, all these all these categories we think are discrete about humans are going to go away, and the question is are they going to come together, is the final transcendent moment, or are they going to wink out and be replaced by by just dead circuitryy, but along that way there will be no... apocalypse, when you're in the when you're in the slurry vat pushing the buttons to keep the slurry coming into your mouth, that will not be, that will not feel like it's a post apocalypse, you will feel a continuum, because the the because this the cultural uh firmament and and the probably even like the political uh uh architecture are going to be not if not the same over time only changing slowly, ship of theseus style until there's something else, that's the most likely outcome and it's not that hard to say it because the, but we're also here, we have free will to the degree we're unaware of our arroundings and that's totally, we are free will, and we have the responsibility to ourselves at each other to prevent that from happening, if if we can, and even if we can't, because a life spent in the pursuit of the virtuous end will be a more rewarding life and a more meaning. life than one uh that acknowledges reality and and accommodates itself to it man that's a good one th darts tonight says rich people are happy this is a great transition thank you so much someone says i don't know man, rich people are happy, someone pointed this out uh to me uh on the internet today, it is a it is uh a little delightful little article uh about sumnor redstone, the media uh, the media giant, one of one of the guys who created the modern media landscape uh specifically um specifically like the cable television concept he was uh and he died like they all do at 97 years old, they live forever because god delights in human evil and their... to suck vampire like the life essence of the working people that they exploit, it really does give them a natural long life, I mean that's it's a metaphor, and it's not literal, but like the adrenacrone notion, that is just a mythic reinterpretation of the of the real flow of life energy down to up in capitalism, but he died at 97, rap to a real one, but there is an article. about his death about his last days that i wanted to find here uh fuck now i'll go here cuz yes i'm sure that some redstone had a great life, i'm sure cumulatively he had a great time, more good days than bad, a lot of delicious steaks, a lot of a lot of hot dames uh hot hair ballooning uh eating children's brains if he wanted. to, all the fun you can have in this life, he had it, but listen to this uh, but listen to this article, CNBC, some uh, so this was, oh, no, never mind, never mind, uh, this is, yes, it's about his last days, but it actually came out two years ago, I thought this was like... has just came out, but apparently this has been his life for at least like four years, so this was his life the last four years of his life, this was him uh mediomogal sumnor redstone who maintains vocal voting control over CBs and viacom has resorted to communicating through an iPad reloaded with audio clips of his voice saying yes no and fuck you uh the alien 94 year old is currently caught in the middle of merger talks between two companies CBS close to making an all stock offer for viacom. uh, this is not the one, there's another article, does anyone know the article i'm talking about? well, i can't find the goddamn thing, but anyway the story is is that apparently in his last days he was reduced in his mental capacity to just his most base urges uh and he was just bas like frantically trying to fuck like trying to get his dick hard and i know that that's a common thing with demential patients is that they get like sexually compulsive as they age but i don't think that there's any reason to think that redstone uh was not i mean just think about it for someone devotes their life to sensual pleasure and exploiting others for their own stockpiling of sensual pleasure. your ability to enjoy it is attenuated over time, so even if as you live longer because you have all the life extension powers of the vampire that you are, your ability to enjoy that life drains out of you. not only do things just get less novel over time, and if you have money you can do everything, which means everything gets less novel, but your ability to enjoy them, your actual sensory ability to enjoy them goes down, because I mean if you like fucking your dickstocks working, uh, if you like eating, you get your taste buds, you're things are shutting down, no matter until they invent some sort of machinery to stop it, your brain, entropy baby, those telemeters are bitch, and so you get witd, so you can't even have the sensory pleasures you once were, and they're at their least, so at a time when you would need them to be the most sensually overwhelming as possible to make up for the fact that they're old, you can have them, it's it's the fucking guy with the with the fucking apples, who's the one, the greek guy, guy with the apples, can't stop eating apples, never gets fall, and so the only thing in your life that had meaning is now something you can't indulge with, and you're left with only a growing recognition of your body's uh impermanence and your impending end and how and the world ending with your consciousness. or the world ending and going beyond and the world continuing beyond your consciousness is unconceivable because your consciousness is the only thing that you credit is existing and you live that way even if you don't think that's how you think that's how you behave and so your last years are torture are torture and you might say well hey i'd take that deal yeah a lot of people would that's why there's so many fucking assholes in the world tantalus i thought it was tantius but then Uh, I thought he couldn't get, I thought the thing was he couldn't get the uh, the the apples, I'm talking, but he can eat the apples. and of course like that's why they're all trying to extend their lives unnaturally, that's why they're all trying to go to the moon, that's why they're all trying to live forever, that's why they want the singularity because they think oh, i'll do it on the computer and my circuits will never die and i'll be able to get infinite amounts of pleasure, infinite amount of experience, but of course that's fantasy, that's a delusion, these people are deluted, that's one of the big reasons i do not credit AI is a threat the way these people ever do, AI these freaking out about AI is it's just backhanded congratulations of themselves, they think god. I'm so smart, I've created a thing that's going to destroy civilization. Take a fucking breakpall, I mean like Oppenheimer could say that, but this is the fucking rumba is not is not the aabomb, okay? And also it's because they uh, like at this point they have their entire uh metaphysical all their metaphysical chips on the board are pushed towards uh uh artificial intelligence. becoming sufficiently uh similar to human intelligence to allow transference of consciousness from one format to the other. the entire world's depend on that, that's why they're doing what they're doing, that's why they're destroying people, that's why they're drinking blood so that they can get a they can make some sort of pact with the devil to get out of the deal of being a human being, but it's not going to work, our assumption that it will work, it's like it does, does any of this look like it? working and i know people will say, oh yeah, no, it's working for the people at the top who are hyper exploiting, yes, but there's a frenzy behind all of this that indicates the sickness at the center of the machine, and of course it's better to be rich than poor, that's why people shouldn't be we should get rid of that shit, i'm just saying is that like the uh, the the the tragedy of human existence is something that cannot be transcendent regardless of where you end up in the Ralsian state of nature, where else you get thrown out of the out of the butthole of the of the random human uh circulator from the v and then pushed through the veil of ignorance like Jim Carry going out of a rubber rinocerus. Yes, I mean, AI is not the same as capitalism, the algorithm taking. over because the algorithm already exists, like you don't have to invent AI for the algorithm, all it is a question of his efficiency of transmission of the algorithm through physical space, it already exists, something separate, like a like a like a machine consciousness that is not just the algorithm of capitalism? no, someone uh, is thanking me for the uh, for hosting a screening of gremlins 2 with Dante that we did a few years ago in la, I want and and thank you for saying thank you, I just that that was a great night and I wanted to just say thank you for reminding me, that was a lot of fun uh, getting to see gremlin su which is a movie that I've worshiped since I was a kid, so on a VHS uh was actually tricked at the beginning by the VHS specific uh fake out in the middle, uh, I think it's a seminal film, Joe Dante, one of the great American directors, uh, getting able to see it in the theater with him, every last. hit every joke hitting like a fucking neutron bomb everyone having a great time uh and then joe getting to take questions and gets to talk about a movie that did not do well at the time and was one of the things that sort of contributed to Joe Dante losing his ability to get whatever he wanted made that he had there for a minute which is tragic because it's such a brilliant fucking film uh but i think he said something about enjoying getting to see it and getting to see people like it and noticing that no this was a good idea you were not wrong the fucking suits were wrong as always. but also if you haven't seen Gremlin's 2, that's another big recommend from me, and the burbs is amazing too, I would, if covid ever ends uh, I would like to go back to LA and do a screening of the burbs too, because I think that's it's a one to punch man, uh, in terms of like and also if you want to get like political, which I don't you think you have to with those movies, but they are both really perceptive uh uh uh artistic expressions of real phenomenon happening like suburban on we and alienation and and like uh the the emergence of like the techno finance economy uh Yeah, the death of the mid-budget movie man, that's a real bummer, it's a real bummer, man, and the thing is that's a kind of stuff that would be perfect for like, that is exactly the kind of art that public funding like... public arts is best for, buse like low-budget movies, you don't really need the government, you know, like you should have foundations and stuff for people who are like uh, I'm talking though about like a relatively even playing field here where we've eliminated massive amounts of poverty, in that situation, low budget movies should be like a hobby thing uh, and big budget movies, I mean if they were to still exist if you had enough money circulating for that to be worthwile doing, which is I think a big if uh, but if that were to happen, the... for everybody, you know, they're the markets going to make them no matter what, those mid-budget movies, they need there to be in a dimension beyond profit in the calculation of whether to make it or not, and there used to be, another aren't, and that's a real thing where you can say the system is not really different, but over time it accumulates pathologies, because as that profit, it's really so much of this shit comes down to the fact that that things other than profit that used to be built into the architect. of American capitalism and and art uh were there because they could be in the minds of the bean counters, in the minds of the bond holders and the minds of of of the in the mind that is in the mind of the global market economy, they could be afford, profit rates were such that they could be indulged and people could buse people don't want to be a mere instrument of an algorithm, no one wants that, they fight against it, even if they're part of it, even if they do well out of it, and cultural superstructures created in part by people trying to alleviate that sense of being instrumentalized by capitalism uh and that's it's it's a double edge sword cuz like that climatizes people to capitalism like all superstructural culture does but at the same time it means the stuff is better it means the actual art even though it's compromised by capitalism is better and more and more it has more qualities and and has a richerness to those qualities and that gets squeezed out like a toothpaste as a profit falls. and the need for return increases, the ability to lose money on things that aren't sure, things that are part of the algorithm is get squeezed out of the system too, and it's it's and that's where the government could stand in and be like, this shit should be made because it'd be cool. uh someone's asking about digital art, i think it's one of those things where i'm of two minds, part of me is like there are some elements of it like squibs where i think no, this is objectively wrong, don't do this, but other things like CGI where i kind of acknowledge, i'm just i have a different frame of reference, like i think that here's an example, i find. and i've always found matte paintings and rear projection in films, charming, fun, and even if you can see it, even if you can notice it, it does not really disrupt my uh, my suspension of disbelief, i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, whereas i think somebody grows up with digital art, they see a a flats or they see like a stop motion or they see a uh projection or a mat painting and they think, wait a minute, that's fake, and the thing is from certain perspectives, like fluidity of motion and like seamlessness, it is faker, but they to them that fakeness is is throbbing, it it pops out because of their their seamlessness of their of their cultural context, i didn't come from that, i can older, so i still value it, so that's a thing where i could say it's uh, it's it's subjective. but i man i was just i had a chill today think i was thinking about squibs again which i'm always doing never 10 minutes away from thinking about squibs they say they say the average man thinks about sex every eight minutes uh that's me with squibs every e minutes thinking about squibs getting mad about now there's no squibs anymore and it occurred to me in horror that because of the whole because of the new uh uh economic dynamic around firearms and movies, it's just it's cost prohibitive on on on the basic slat to do indulgent shit like use and expensive cameras or use rare film, you have to fight for that, it's it's not, it's not included in sweet, it's been seamlessly removed, which means that in the future real guns, firing blanks and real squibs are going to only be featured in films that are doing it as a self-conscious artistic choice that are doing it as part of a broader thing, like movies that are in black and white now that are that are that are conceptual, that means that everything else, all the genre. movies that i would love to enjoy and are at the level of we're not trying to deconstruct anything, we're not making an artistic point, we're just doing an action movie, it's going to be off the table as much as it would be to film one and fucking uh uh in like the academy ratio and black and white like the lighthouse, that's a bummer man, and i think it's true, i i can't really think, i can't really imagine that that's not the case now, especially with everybody streaming every movie now, those dog shit fucking streaming links were like though you can't even get really black or anything and it's just less saturated and everyone's on their dang phone and now i sound like Andy Rooney, i was trying to be even handed there and then i ended up turning an Andy Rooney, the swibs will do that to me, oh Danny boy, the squibs, the squibs are calling from Glenn to Glenn and down the mountainside, the sun is gone and all. what's my favorite nugget sauce? sashwan baby? no, i had the sashwan sauce, it was dog shit, like not even disappointing compared to the ridiculous height because nothing could have been that good, considering the cultural, the amount of cultural. ink and energy spent on a dipping sauce to McDonald's, how good it would have had to have been to make that in any way proportional, it would have had to have been the best tasting food on earth, uh, it's like the fucking squeezed like uh, it's like they took the the uh, like a ibis and like wrung out its spinal column or something, it would have to be made of ground unicorn horn or something. but even for McDonald's sauce it was dog shit, very very sweet, it was basically just a sweet and sour sauce. I was thinking, the reason I actually did kind of, I'll admit get a little excited about it when they brought it back is because when they said seshwan sauce, that made me think of seshwan pepper sauce like with the red, like with the pepper corns, you know, in seshwan cuisine, and I thought, oh, oh shit, fuck, that'd be good, uh, but no, it was... was just another sweet and sour sauce, it was dog shit, and the funny thing is is they introduced it after the big fuck up, they introduced it and they said, hey, we have it now, hey guys, we have it, we have such one sauce, and it lasted like two weeks because nobody gave a shit, and it wasn't good enough to stick around, i would say of the mass market ones you can get, i like ranch, but i also like uh barbecue, i suspect that my favorite sauce, if it could be found. if someone could make this, if a if a if like a a chick fillet or a Wendy's or McDonald's made this, they would have my my business for life, a a nugget dipping sauce based on uh, korean red pepper paste, the stuff they use on uh on the Korean fried chicken, it's it's it's i don't know how to pronounce it, uh, that is the bomb, that stuff is awesome. and if i could dip those go gochujang gochujang that's it, a gochujang pepper paste, because the thing about is i wanted to have, i wanted to have a velvety texture, but i also want like a ketchupy umami residence and i want that spice, it's perfect, so yes that stuff, oh i'm really hungry, i haven't had dinner yet, i can't wait, what am i going to get, what am i going to get? maybe i'll get nugget. you guys have inspired me, but maybe i wouldn't get nuggets because i don't have any of that pastes and it would feel like actually i might have that paste, oh my god, i might have that paste guys, oh my god guys, if i have that stuff, it's happening, hey guys, feeling good, feel like this has been a good stream, good mixture of the high and the low, dionisian and such and the uh, what's the other one? the Apollonian, that's it, dinizon and the Apollonian, uh, you guys, I got to admit someone's asking about how much I go outside and if I feel panicked. I got to say, I kind of, I, it's not that I don't care about getting it, it looks terrifying and I really don't want to get it uh, but uh, I kind of am not really that afraid of getting it, I i think that we've reached at least where I live, a a mask saturation point that when I go out I don't feel that scared, I don't get, I'm not uh, willy nilly about it, of course, I keep my distance and I keep my mask on, uh, but I feel like enough people are doing that and and everything is distanced enough, but I'm not really feeling like I'm taking my life in my hands that much anymore. but i mean i could get it but you know you get killed walking your doggy oh that's funny idea someone said there should be an official chapo mask. where it's the soy face, god the nazis will get so mad cuuse they thought that up, we stole it from them, tough shit motherfucker, that's what happens, maybe if you value jacking off in the bank lobby less, you could get some bits out, do I feel that the left is due for a spiritual awakening? I have to say, I mean, I've said on the show explicitly, yes, I mean, I've been saying that for a while now, I've been saying that spirituality needs to be in meshed with practice. and with analysis to overcome the sort of this liberal hidonic treadmill logger heads we're at, and I think it's going to happen, I just don't know if it's what form it's going to take or whether it's going to be effective, that's that's the big, those are the big questions as always, but I also think it's going to happen because I've been as I've been talking about it, people have talked to me about what they're thinking, and a lot of people I know, including people who do not even listen to this shit and have no idea what I'm yelling about on the goddamn internet have come to the same conclusion and are trying to move... like graspingly towards that direction and I feel like that's very good, I don't know what direction it'll take, but I so far I have faith that that will that I think people get it, I think enough people get it that you could build the kernel of something, and that's all we can ask for right now, because for the love of God, you can't get ahead of yourself, numbers are so small, getting the people on your side, real real challenge, and I think people say, well we're totally atomised how... you know we're totally pleasure seeking, but like the pleasure is getting attenuated very quickly, and that's that's one of the situations that can bleed people towards change and I hate, I know it's awful to have to depend on individual like awakenings, as I have said, that's not how change happens in the mass, but the traditional methods are kind of dead right now, I guess it's less a question of like who to appeal to, and more a question of what appeal needs to be made. Can dialectics defeat the demi urge uh, I mean yeah, they better, they better, buse that's that's the only thing that could. Can we get that spiritual wakening by normalizings i hate to do any of that normalizing stuff because one I think it's sort of a trap to say that you can normalize something because then it gives more weight to your individual indulgence and speech about said uh then is warranted by the actual weight of the act and then conversely it provides you with like if you hate somebody and they're not doing anything outwardly terrible, they're not they're not doing they're not saying any of the uh the prescribed curslers and they're not they're not doing any of the the the dog whistles, you can say that they're normalizing something bad, you can say like and then you're already halfway there to to righteousness, but uh, the problem with the psychedelic thing is, it's the same problem. is like getting, it's the same problem in Herren and people think that you can do something like have Robin Diangelo struggle session stand racism, they both, they both assume a subject to is already halfway to. position, they assume a subject to is voluntarily in a room having accepted your certain opening premise that you could that build a psychodelic experience on top of or build a uh a recognition of my own racial privilege on top of, but you're you're you're assuming when you're talking about an unbounded population, a lot of the assumptions built in are assumptions are based around self-selected groups and when it comes to psychodelics, you have to be taking it on purpose, and you have to have some sort of purpose to it, now not necessarily, but it sure as hell uh makes it a more uh efficient vector. uh, typing rebellion, but instead of Jesus, we do it with marks, you're basically describing the Chinese revolution, that was, that was the uh, that was the Chinese communist revolution, was the typing rebellion with. replacing Jesus, have i ever fired myself, someone ask if I have ever fired a gun myself? Yes, I fired a number of guns, I mean uh, I have fired an elephant gun, like, I fired a SKS, which is uh, sort of like a knockoff ak47 banana clip, I fired a 454 suel, which is one of the largest handguns, um, or most powerful handguns, motherfucker kicks like a mule, almost put my arms over my head, shotgun, block brap, I'm strapped, not. really, but guns are cool. What chain would i review for doboys? Good question. I assume they've covered most of them. If they haven't done culvers, obviously I would do culvers, that's a no brainer, but I got to assume they've done culvers already. If not culvers, I would, if they have not had somebody on that show to defend arbies, I would defend arbies for sure. I would do that too. Ah, of course they did covers a live show. Yeah, maybe. w, i don't know, i'm trying to think of another one then, another like something on some sort of uh, has anyone talked about that dicky's place, i've never been there, it seems weird, fast food. barbecue restaurant, that seems like a contradiction in terms, we do have ANW in America, not that many, but I remember going to one as a kid, oh god, rocky racoco garbage, oh barf, oh god, I could do mission barbecue, that'd be funny, I go to mission. barbecue, I guarantee you that you can go in there without a mask, they don't give a shit. Fazolis, there is a fazolis in Indiana, I think, it's got to be one of the last ones in America, I would love to go to one of the last fazolis cuuse I went to Fazolis all of the time when I was a kid, fazoles was a top tier choice, that was that was a i have a distinct memory of skipping school with some guys and galls uh senior year, getting a car and going to vizolis, that's how fucking that's how... i partied in high school, fuck this bullshit, going to eat these thin ass ravioli with like the ketchup sauce on them, but they had the fucking they had unlimited breadsticks baby, you go up there and they bring them around, they had like they had like half ass table service, they bring it around and they bring you, they have a basket, they bring you the the breadsticks, oh hell yeah, if i could find a fizolies, i would absolutely go, yes, yes, yes, quite, yes, yes, oh man, i'm getting prucian reveries thinking about fazolis now. I guarantee you if I ate it, it would be like, this is not fit for hogs, this is pigslop, but it would still be funny, uh, also another one that was... favorite is a kid that is gone away now and i think there's still a few are left Schlotskies, i remember enjoying their weird bread, they had the their sandwiches had a very, very weird bread, they almost unique, sort of the way that uh in and out fries are unique among fast food fries, and just like with in and out fries, i like it cuuse it's weird and different, and i i remember liking the weird Schlotski's bread, and so if there's a Schlotskies, i would love to go there and get that back. Oh man, people are saying Schlotski is still good, damn it, I had a chance to go to a Schlotskies a while ago and I talked, I said, nah, I just remember it, I remember it as being good, and now people are telling me it rips, damn it, next time I just got to go yolo on it and say if it's bad it's bad, I would love to go to publics, I've never been, never been, never spent enough time in the south to go to a grocery store. but i've heard the chicken is very good and i would like to try it, goddamn i i am gonna ooh oh i'm gonna nugg up i think after this big boy needs his treaty treats a chicken tender subs see i don't know if i like that idea that just seems like it's too much starch it's like i don't eat the fries and the chicken tenders at the same time i don't like wrap the chicken tender in french fries and eat it, why would i want to put a big carb around the fries? to me they're sex, they're zackspees is another one i would like to try, never had that. yeah, i don't think i like that, it's like, why am i biting through bread to get to breading? nope, you have not sold me on the concept of a chicken tender sub, i'm afraid, sorry, can get regular chicken, and besides i always take bone in over tendies, tendies are fine once in a while, tendis and nuggets are fine. if you're in the mood like i've kind of talk because of the dipping sauces, but it's because of the dipping sauces, that's all be, let's all let's stop shitting ourselves, okay? all non-bone in tried chicken is about the sauce, and it's about what's the easiest way, oh boneless, oh great, i can stuff this in my mouth fast without having to get around bones. if you want to taste the chicken, if you're about the flavor, you got to have the bone, got to have bone in, and i'll so i usually want bone in, but once in a while if it's really cuuse i want dip something in something. That's when I'm going to get a a boneless fried chicken item, like canes uh, not raisen canes, or no, it is raisen canes, but it is not the guy that uh Trump talked to who he loves, uh, who he thought it was raison, he thought it was raisen like, he thought it was raisen like the fruit, he thought it was raisen like the fruit, because raison cane i think that's like a old time saying it from the bible, i don't think he had any as a little lord fleroy in crushed velvet pantaloons in his little gated community in in queens i don't think he knew anything about raising cane one way or the other but yeah like uh i think the canes is pretty good it's juicy which is usually the hard part with wings or with uh strip tenders especially when they're that thick bause those they're relatively thick and it's taste juicy and the breadding's fine but you stay you come for that sauce and i do think the sauce is good but if the sauce wasn't good, i would not think it was good. raison herman cane, i don't think i mean, i know people say, wow, things move so fast, it's it, we we just normalize things, but i really don't think, i don't think enough people emphasized the sheer, hallucinatory, mad, fillini ask uh, dark humor of... a former presidential candidate, a guy who pulled at the top of the heap in the crowded 2012 field for a while, and if he hadn't stumbled under the pressure when he was the frontrunner, if he had been able to hold up a little stronger, i think he had a very good chance at that nomination because he was wildly and uniquely popular in the south, people loved him in the south because he was the he was a dream for all the white southern reaccionaries who vote in uh republican primer. he was a black guy who said which meant they weren't racist and he really loved god and he hated muslims, and he had like that kind of dumb guy thing that they think is charming because they're all fucking dipshits, and they loved him, if it had gotten to the south he might have won. this guy goes to a rally to the for the president, not even, it's not even close to the election, it's just as a way for him to get his spirits up because everyone's been saying mean things to... him during the COVID quarantine and he wanted to have people say nice things to him, like people talk about his endless campaigning and his rallys and how oh he's going to oklahoma uh he's going to telsa uh uh for June 10th, he's he's signaling the alt right and oh he's going to he's going look at the day he's going here and he's trying to what happens with Trump is he watches tv all day and yes he watches the people be nice to him on fox but he also watches everyone else be mean to him and it gets him his power his health power levels go down his power bar depletes and the only thing they can really top it off like watching Fox as a little bit is getting a rally and having people say he's good and so... for fucking Kerman came for no reason and just to own the libs who think that there's really a virus going around, he goes maskless to this rally where the highlight was watching the president of the United States during a world defining crisis brag about how he was able to drink a glass of water with one hand and walk successfully down a fucking very ni uh a very slight incline while hooting uh barbarian slap jaws. banged their hooves together and then he fucking died for that, he died, his ass is dead buse he did that, buse he wanted to give the president a little pick me up because he was was so shated, he did drink that water, you did a good job and the corona, that's not real corona, just puking my just bit right in my face, that's not real stuff, oh i don't feel so good, dead and his fucking twitter account is still up. and is posting banal mega shit about like Camala Harris is trying to say that she's a centrist girlfriend you're tripping the motherfuckers in the ground that's all of our faites just to be this echoing digital signature created by an algorithm meant to like represent our entire time on earth in a little little pitthy little epic uh sayings that just flatten us into essentially the... worst versions of ourselves, jobs I had before I was a podcaster, the longest gig I had was for number of years I worked at Barns and noble, uh, I was. cashier, i was very frustrated with being a cashier and thankfully i was able to get moved over to the information desk where i helped people find books and that was and then did stocking and stuff and that was good that was probably the best job i had and the longest i held uh grad student where i was a during my abortive uh my abortive ma pursuit uh i worked as i've said before for regis the company that goes in and and inventories retail retail inventory. and when i was a kid i was a dishwasher and i worked at a uh i worked at a grocery store unloading the truck before my back obviously i got to say that somebody asked the most subversive book i read and i did get it at barns and noble i saw the title and it it just struck me and i ended up buying it when i was in college, i think, uh, so a little older, but you know, it took me a while to really even think politically, it was, it's a it's a buy a guy who i don't actually agree with very much anymore, uh, Derek Jensen, the culture of make believe, which is because the thing about him is he's essentially an an prim and i i discount that entire tradition, but just in terms of reading something that was so radically at odds with everything i thought i had kind of come to terms with as understanding the world, even through like a jaded a relatively jaded like left lens, like i wasn't a chud or anything, i was like, you know, i i was a uh, i was not a bush fan, but it was still relatively uh, you know, it was a, it was a narrow conception of like why i believe what i believe, and it was such a shock reading it, and it was such a challenge that i ended up having to like break down and reconfigure a number of things that i had held as assumptions, and even though i don't think that he's right in any kind of like you know. uh removed uh objective sense, i feel like for me anyway, his contribution to my intellectual development was very useful, but i would certainly not endorse even i can't even remember what a lot of the stuff in the book was and i probably wouldn't endorse any of it, because at this point i don't think i need i need that same thing, you know, and like that's why it's so hard to recommend books and talk about books objectively is because when you're talking about things that contribute to intellectual progression, there's times you need something and then you don't need it anymore, and then like if somebody else is asking about it and trying to evaluate it, well where where are they? what do they need? you don't know, and it's it's... zoomed into the into the debate and it and it makes it harder to kind of clarify what you're talking about. All right, I'm gonna uh, I'm gonna sign off here with a few maybe one more question. the Fred Hampton movie, it's probably not going to be good. I will say this though, uh, there's this funny thing of people saying, fuck this Hollywood movie about uh, about Fred Hampton, fuck off, but then they'll be like, and you know what, they did this wrong, and it's like, hold on a minute, what's the problem here, you know, is this thing categorically to be condemned or is it to be engaged with artistically, if it's one or the other, you don't have to, you don't have to say both, you know, uh, is going to think you're a sell out if you just engage with the thing as a work of art, under capitalism attenuated at every level by that fact, but if you want to condem it, condemn it, and then just don't talk about its aesthetic qualities, what's the point, it's it's beside the point, you're implying that there is a version of this movie that would have been better, and then you're denying the material underpurding, undergrdings of the endeavor of making a fucking film. i will say the one thing that so people who are engaging with it artistically have seen a number of people annoy that it appears to be through the... point of view of the guy who ratted him out, this the FBI informant and not Fred Hampton uh, and I mean the title is kind of a of a clue there, it's called Judas and the black Messiah, and people get mad at that, and I have to say from a dramatic point of view, if if you're just like looking to make a movie, I get there are ways that you can make a movie about fredhampton where he's the protagonist, but I think it's a lot harder, but there are more, there are more. basically the character who stands out is the character who you would follow is him because he's conflicted because he has a dynamic within his character of being torn between uh his self interest and his growing devotion you might say well that's you know giving him that credit is bad cuuse he's a piece of shit and fuck him if you make any of the characters like that it'll be a bad movie. if you make any of the characters as one-dimensionals people on twitter want to make every historical character uh It's going to suck because Fred Hampton's going to be boringly perfect and that guy's going to be boringly evil, and I have to say that these got people who say they want a movie where Fred Hampton's the protagonist, you'd have to show flaws and are you ready for that, are you gonna, how far can they go in conflict in in depicting a complex character before you start freaking out that they're doing propaganda and undermining his his legacy, like if if you if sort of stuck with Hampton is saint, which the title implies, yeah we are, and I think we are, I think given like anxiety of influence and and the public space and people knowing what's expected of them, they kind of are stuck with Hampton as the saint, so then where is the interesting story, Judah, judas much more interesting than Jesus, and I guess you could try to make like a saint Hampton interesting, but it's a it's a higher bar. What are hot dogs made out of assholes and elbows? All right guys, one more question and then I'm I'm I'm piecing out, perhaps to dream, perhaps to mile on some nuggs. Oh, I'll just stand with this, the UAE, Israel thing, I'm wondering, I guess it's just a evidence of like the lack, the fact that the UAE essentially doesn't have a public, it's got a royal family and a bunch of slaves. that they don't have to worry about public opinion the way the saudis do uh and the and so it's easier for them to just take the the fact that everybody at the diplomatic level knows and everyone who pays attention really to anything knows is that there is a that Israel and the GCC countries Bahrain UAE and uh Saudi Arabia are uh are allies they might as well be in a defense pact, they they've got their own NATO for the Middle East essentially. uh and they're doing their own gladio in Syria and they have been for the last decade and and they're doing conventional like cosabo style warfare in uh in Yemen, only much more intensely horrifying. uh, like they have, they have an agreement, they're together, uh, but that's not a thing that like the public in Saudi Arabia would be able to accept, but since there's no public in uh in the UAE, I guess the thought was, I guess they wanted to do Trump a favor, like hey, Trump's looking like he's getting his ass kicked, doesn't what he's doing, he needs a win, what if he brokerers Midy's peace? I mean, remember he sent Jared to do that, and his came back with something that no one could agree with, it was absolutely out of the question, and and it just died on the table, complete disaster, another humiliation after building it up so much, these guys keep doing that buse they keep not realizing how little they actually can do uh duning cruger allstar is a lot of them, but here it's like hey peace just like Jimmy Carter got uh got got him on the table got him to like they're just taking something that was understood uh and making it formal, they're just taking the the conversations that had to be had like on the non uh government line can now be done on the on the... land life, that's it, um, and it's funny, I think it's, I, more than anything, I think it's a proof that Trump wanted to win, and asked them as a favor, hey, could you guys pretend to like, apparently Israel's big concession is going to stop expanding their illegal west bank settlements, they're going to stop doing something that they are already enjoined from doing under international law, wow, and not even forever, slow down, wow, holy crap. Yeah, no, the orb picture tells you all you need to know about those freaks and they're all allied with Israel, it's all one, it's all one block, it's a block opposed to the Iranian block with turkey in the middle sort of the trying to have it both ways, the great game baby, you got the you got the American GCC Israel block, jordan and whatnot, Egypt then you got the the uh got Iran, Iraq is the contestant point, and Syria hanging on there, and then Turkey for a while was pretty much firmly in the US Saudi camp, but they have been over the past half decade after uh, they didn't get the result they wanted in Syria and had to start intervening more, are now sort of playing both sides, although they're still going hard to the paint against Egypt in uh, in Libya, but that's i mean that's that's about border security, Libya's right. there, they want to have make sure that they have uh complete control of whatever government is in that area next to uh, next to the Egyptian border, especially considering that they've been in a low grade insurgency over since CC overs remorcing and killed everybody in the square, woo, man, this was a long one, but I had fun, might, might do one more question, but I am really craving those tendies, it's just I have nothing else to do tonight, so it's like... but I am, I'm basically fighting my own hunger. All right, one more question. Oh, the guy wrote the bush, the guy wrote the uh bear about uh, the guy, the the Bush guy who wrote about who wrote the novel where a bear is used to have sex with women at like a brothle in Japan. I believe it was scooter Libby, let me confirm that. I'm not, I didn't check that first. I didn't cheat. I'm pretty sure using my my bush era. uh blog memory, i think it was scooter liv, yeah, it was boo, yeah, now i remember all that shit, man, it's all in my head for no reason, scooter libby, that was the guy, there was a time. one of the reasons i was immunized, i mean one of the many reasons, just time and experience being the most of them, but one of the big reasons i was immunized against rushia gate from the beginning, immunized against anything having to do with Kome or fucking muller was that that has already happened before in the form of patrick fritzgerald and the fucking plane investigation and that little twirp scooter fucking liby, the amount of amount of attention that i gave that guy, the amount of psychic energy i i put into his fate buse i thought it was going to break the whole thing open and they were going to frog march just like joe willison said they were going to frog march. uh carrove out of the white house and then he was going to flip on shany deluted, delusional, all right guys, this has been fun, i never wore a big johnson shirt in high school, i actually avoided the graphic T era, I respected them from afar, but I don't think I owned a single one, but maybe I should get some ironically, like I could be the compound. in the in the uh after the collapse of the east coast wearing uh wearing track pants and coed naked lacross shirt and it still won't feel like the apocalypse it'll feel like like a tuesday be like oh i got to fight the marawders again god damn it fighting the miraders is now like uh it's part it's part and parcel with the whole package of being part of society the market the market uh sinuws will not break they have to be severed all right guys bye bye
