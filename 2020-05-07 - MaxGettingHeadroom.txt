 Oh, what's going on here? Oh shit, all right, I'm good right, oh boy, all right, I'm assuming I'm good, hi guys, uh, I am not looking to get top, no, it's a joke, anybody remember hacks headroom, he was a guy, hello, hello, I'm... I'm speaking as headrome, the man, the floating head, the floating head from your dreams, the floating head that is floated in every head, Matt Frewer, remember them, Matt Fruwer, he was max headrum, I was was a big fan of Matt, Matt Frewer, I thought he was pretty good, hello everyone, what's going on? with you folks, what's going on with the fine folks of the internated web? i don't know enough about Alfred McCoy to speak one way or the other about him, i'll admit that. sorry, talked about the left 16. the 1961 project i think a couple days ago uh we got an nebriated past coming out today about upton sinclair and the 1934 new york governor's race which is genuinely an amazing uh sort of pre-sequel to the harb or a harbincher to the sanders campaign in a lot of ways uh and it should be fun to talk about it's okay. see what you guys think, the left is a mess, it's a mess, folks, i can't believe it, it's such a mess, bye-bye, honey, oh yeah, you know what, that's a good idea so i'll if people have questions about sinclair and the campaign that they want to talk about after the episode comes out, yeah, by all means bring them here. that'l be good, it'l be like a reading a little reading series or a little uh like a study group or whatever you want to call it to the degree you want to do that, i'm vibing with whatever you guys are putting down, oh yeah, keerker guard, yeah, he was a fellow traveler for sure, yeah, now the leap of faith i now understand is literally like the engine of all thought, yeah, no, I'm vibing hard on Mr. Kiergard, well done soren, somebody wants me to consider using a simple up-voting system to solicit questions, I don't know what that means, I don't know, I'm afraid, I'm scared, is RBG dead or not? I mean, I probably I think she's probably been dead for a while, I think that. the DNC budget that isn't sent been sent towards killing people in the primary uh has been spent keeping her alive in like an animatronic state, i think she might be a puppet, she might be an actual puppet. I feel like chicken tonight, like chicken tonight, ah, oh no, don't tell me I'm breathing heavily again, don't tell me I'm dying, I can't handle it, I start thinking I'm gandolfini in a fucking hotel room in Rome and I'm... going to pitch forward, i mean i'd be okay with that, but i'd rather, i'd rather have a little bit more time, so please don't trigger me that way. "if we run out of burgers man, that's going to be the real ooh boy, I've been thinking about this, like the degree to which we have pulled back social tensions in this country by rapidly ratcheting down people's quality of life, when that's the only thing we have to exchange for the rapidly alienated lives, like we have spiritually and materially alienated everyone in this country to a monstrous degree." and the only thing that is compensated for it is a regime of absolute perfectly imagined convenience, it might not be real, you might not always have perfect convenience, but there is a dream of fully realized convenience, and and then people get some percentage of that and it and it makes them sort of okay with the system as it exists, and there's a real chance that this fly wheel might be broken, and if that's the case, there's not going to be anything holding back just the snapping of these fucking tensions one after the other and - It's going to, I predict, I predict bad news, just even if things stay stable in like a geopolitical sense and the economy technically still exists and you know it's like it's sort of like 2008 but worse, but otherwise things are basically stable, you're still going to see things start snapping at the social level, because things are going to get courser and courser, and one of the things that's going to make that happen is we're probably going to be habituated to be okay with thousands of people dying of coronavirus and us not really caring about it. because if we care about it then we can't participate in the economy and then we're back into a collapse, which means we're not going to end up blaming ourselves to some degree for all this death, which means we're going to have to start just to not to think about that, we're going to dehumanize the dead, which means we're going to dehumanize everyone around us and i think that those those social bonds are going to start snapping like fucking rigging in a in a sinking pirate ship and you're going to see some uh upteic and violence and stuff, it could be bad, but the thing that might stop that from happening is that the US still is the consumer of last resort for the world economy, the us, the US economy is the only place where excess demand goes, if excess demand doesn't have somewhere to go, you have a buildup in the system, and at this point it's a world economy and a buildup of demand that can't be expressed in in the economy, or a buildup of supply rather, a buildup of supply in the economy that cannot be uh accommodated is genuinely catastrophic, talking about a world depression, so there's every interest in the world to see the US bailed out of this in the short term, so they're going to bail money into us like crazy, but we're going to be pumping blood out of an aorta, and the question is at some point the body is going to, unless we patch up the wound, the body is going to start expiring, uh, but if it doesn't, the good news is we have time, i think because they're going to start pumping in a lot to try to stabilize this thing, and in that time we can like organize as must we can to resist it, to resist the new lines as they emerge. i don't want to get to doomer because i honestly feel like at every level we have agency, we just have to be aware of where we are what we can do. we just have to be conscious, we just have to be conscious man. it's really true, if we're conscious of our moment, we can strike where we must. Olaf palm assassination, ooh, that's an interesting one, my gut is that it was boss, my gut it was the South African uh, apartide era government, the ones that blew up Ruth first, uh, they were known for espionage, they were known for extra-territorial assassinations, sort of the African version of the condor, uh, and palm was considered a threat to a lot of interest there, but also in the middle east i know that he was uh, i know Israel, but the thing is Israel in south africa worked handing glove in the 80s, so that could have easily been the pipeline, i don't know, it's a very interesting case, new new anibrated pass today, today will be released, it's about up inclares 1934 run for california. Governor, I think it's going to be a good one, uh, just dropped, booya, drop, my single is dropping, just dropped, boom, check out my my new my, I'm trying to crown things, don't don't. try to tell me to talk about nosticism because that's the kind of thing that will get me off the beam, i'm trying to stay grounded, trying to ground everything in as close to a material observation as possible to say. connected, this is all about translation, so yeah, let's ask things a little less obscure than that, please, but I do love talking about nasticism, oh no, don't fuck the beam, you must seek the beam, you must walk the... beam, that is your goal in life, that if whether you know it or not, the goal of your life is to walk on the beam, the beam is us, but we must be aware of it, yes. Oh yes, the type rebellion, the type rebellion really is really interesting, this is one of the biggest like modern wars in terms of casualties and number of people involved in it, since since the development of gunpowder in the west, it was a huge massive conflict, it was over 30 million people died, but it's almost never talked about. outside of presumably China, but I don't know how they even contextualize it, presumably it's some sort of like peasant precursor to the uh Chinese communist revolution, and therefore the the good guys in their version are the type and the bad guys are the are the empire, uh, which I think is honestly kind of broadly true, and I feel like it would have been better for China in the long run if the taip had won, I feel like the the the uh, the king should have ended then or however the hell you say it, uh, that was... they should have ended, and honestly, the reason they didn't end is because of western intervention, because the western powers which at that moment were trying to carve up China and were in the process of fighting the opium wars to export uh their their their surplus from their from their trade in India uh to China, and the second Indian opian war happened in the middle of the fucking rebellion, um, but they eventually provided direct aid uh to the uh cause and that helped sort of push them uh into victory, and uh, I think, I think that was a bungle from world historical perspective. Ching, the ching, yeah, no, they that that was their time, they had lost all legitimacy, but I really think that's another. just say thing about the uh, so it's this incredibly powerful and important even in world history, this hinge point, and you can kind of think of it as a thing that happened that didn't, because you kind of think of everything is determined, but then you can stop back and like look at, well what could realistically have happened here that didn't, and you're like, wow, there was a lot of, there was a lot of given this, we could be much farther along in like progress as a civilization, but we could also be much worse case, much worse shape, you know, we don't know, uh, but we can see how how the cont of things shape up and that is like one of those like you they almost knock the coke machine over and then it knocked back on his heels but then a couple more times and bang it was over um but the whole thing started basically because the guy failed his SATs that is what caused the death of 30 million people in mid-19th century China a dude flunked his finals. and I don't, I don't, there's something very endering about that, because uh, in in that and among the like the peasant class uh in in in Ching China, there was basically no social mobility outside the bureaucracy, if you remember of the landless peasant class, especially the hacka uh migrants in the south who had migrated generations previously from northern clims and had never achieved any sort of uh claim to land. "the only way you're getting out of a pretty dreary peasant life is study for the damn imperial exams to become a bureaucrat because they sure shit needed a lot of those and so these kids studied and they studied and they studied and they studied they crammed the hell out of it and it was mostly wrote recitation of classic confusion texts, it wasn't even like logic problems or anything, it was just cramming things directly into your face so that you could regurgitate them uh in the testing area and it was. an incredibly incredibly rigorous thing, it was like a 1% uh pass rate, and you could retake it, but it cost money and it took a long time between tries. and the dude who started the whole thing, he just lost, he he failed too many times and he fucking went, he he went, he basically had a fever, he broke into a fever, he was in uh in a kind of a coma coma state for a while, and when he came out having read a bunch of christian pamphlets that had been left in his village by uh uh western missionaries, he decided that he had visited Jesus in heaven and discovered that he was his brother and so he launched this peasant rebellion that spread through central China and eventually almost overtook the entire empire and looked like it really honestly should have uh and then they just kind of made some mistakes they retrenched when they shouldn't have they wait that and then they was the decisive decisive western intervention um but it's a very interesting story and uh It really does tell you, you know, you got to give kids a chance, they can't have to, they can't all have to be uh, that nerdy, you know, you got to let them skateboard sometimes, relax. and it's interesting because you could kind of evaluate uh the the process of the uh of the type rebellion and then map it then after the the like you look at typing and then you look at what happened after it culminating in the communist takeover it's sort of like a a a refracted version of itself sped up through biotechnology because what you had uh with the tiping was a a a staltified uh uh situation where you had like an excess of landless peasants, too many miles, not enough land, no efficient exchange, things were all built up uh, there was no uh legitimacy to the regime, the fact that it was a conquerer regime didn't help certainly that there was and han chinese who made it up uh and this figure comes out using a western concept, this idea of like millenniar christianity to like create a a a a a uh a state of urgency to create a people who demand change in the here and now because they're going to make something uh spiritual like out of matter, which they're getting directly from the west here in the form of imported christianity, which then causes the whole thing to erupt and shatter, and then like I said, forces probably would have eventually resolved with the the tip at least taking over a huge chunk of China, instead they were defeated with the help of the west, and then that rickety old emp'. that shing empire eventually knocked over by the nationalist rebellion with sunsen, but then basically breaking up into empire, into anarchy, because you can't just take over that height of power and expect to hold on to it when everything underneath it is destroyed, and then if you think about it, the chinese communist rebellion is then a sped up a more successful technological replay of the Typain where you have the same situation. you have mass numbers of peasants, well more than there are land, hugely exploited uh rural peasantry, and then you have this a western idea of communism to rally them to, which then turns them into an organized and self-motivated unit to to attack the rotten status quo, which they then defeat. because it's not like mouse was the genius who thought, hey, let's get the peasantry involved, ma was just enough of a person removed from dog, the dogmatism at the heart of like soviet marxism, which at that point was basically a religious dogma on par with like you know. uh the inquisition catholicism uh, he was un, he was uninvested enough in communiism as a concept, to think, well to just recognize, well we've just got our asses kicked at the cities, there is no more working class to organize, they just got massacred by the nationalists, there is this big chunk of landless peasants, so why don't we go to them, it was just recognizing the reality of where the social pressures were, and so then it's like maoism if in anything is it's about adaptability, you know, because it was itself an adaption to the conditions on the ground using marxism is like the basis. It was just a recognition of conditions, and that's all we should ever be seeking for, is to recognize conditions through the lens of our ideology, but not determined entirely by our ideology, hopefully by trying to honestly engage with the world around us, in addition. uh somebody asked why is there a tend towards zelotory among uh subaltern resistance groups i honestly think what it is is like you start involving yourself in a left-wing movement in a in a resistance movement with the hope that you're going to immediately as possible overturn the... because that's what you want, you want this thing that sucks to stop, but the thing is is that that fight takes time, and it might take longer than realistically you could invest in believing things will change, and so that means that you either have to give up, because you you either give up because you know that it's not worth the the additional pain of depriving yourself in the name of you, the revolution, or you get more benefit. you put all of your emotional investment in the cause uh itself and so all of your power all of your emotional energy goes into imagining the the the the party the thing you're working towards the thing you're working through as like the the the repository of all of your emotional energy and so that means that you get super super strident on details of uh of uh like ideology because doesn't attach the real world cuz the real world sucks in the real world you're doing nothing, you're in misery, you're eating soup in a in a safe house, in your head though, you're fighting at the most deep levels of like uh uh historical menucia that have no connection to reality, but that's where all of your emotional energy is, because if it isn't there, it's here and now and that sucks. I will definitely say that um, I i have never, I'll admit that I never really vibed with David Lynch, but I should definitely give his films another look, someone just said here that he is grill pill, and uh, even with my limited exposure to his work, he is 100% grill pill, he is clearly vibing at his own frequency, moving with as little friction through the world as possible, and I to respect that by giving his uh work more of a focus. yeah, but who cares if he voted for Reagan? what difference does it make? did he elect Ronald Reagan? Ronald Reagan won in two giant landslides. What did uh David Linche's two votes for Donald Reagan Ronald Reagan in two elections do to make anyone's life worse? How much did his films do to make people's lives better, which one are you weighing more heavily? where is your emotional energy in the real world or in a fantasy realm where you're sorting people into good and bad and then having them fight each other like your your uh your gi joes, your childhood GI joes, your pok is 'm folks, we have a cheeto in the white house, i don't know if you guys are aware of this, but there is a god damned, a cursed by god himself, curse to live in this world, a human mind embodied physically in the crumbling cornstarch and corn syrup creation, known as a cheeto, a disgusting orange globule'. sitting in our white house and the people's house itself, defiled by cheeto dust, cheeto dust, the dust mites the size of frizbies, my god, we'll never get that color out, it'll never be the white house again, it will be the orange house, it will always, the way that it's only the white house because they burned it down in the war of 1812 and we've rebuilt it with white paint, it's now it's now. going to be the orange house for all of history, because the cursed cheeto resides there, the cursed orange cheeto, he defiles my mind. he's a damn cheeto folks and i'm not a fan of him, those are doritos by the way, you people are putting doritos in the chat, he is not a dorito, i think that uh, i think our latino friends would say that's racist, it's going to be the orange house, it's the orange house, i'm telling you. uh, do you think we need a beppe grill type? you know, that's what i've been thinking about is that the thing is, that's why i was thinking about Jessie Ventura, because i honestly don't know how you can like break up the the kind of asified ideas around the parties anymore, i feel like democrats, bernie needed to is a democrat because that's where like the the eyeballs were, but like he needed enough people who just are never going to tune into a democratic race because they rightly perceive the democrats as a scumbag party of capital even if they don't think of it that way, so a third party with somebody who is largely known and charismatic and had the imperature of like the left, but also a pop culture buying to get past people's uh dislike. politics, which is what Trump used by the way, buse Trump remember ran as a celebrity, he didn't run as a rich guy, he didn't run as a republican, he ran as a celebrity, and you if you could take that energy, that spectacle energy with and and feed it into some goddamn like actual left, political infrastructure and some ideology to like buffer it up into a real boy, it could be something, damn it, but I don't know if we have anybody like that, like even Jessie Vencera honestly. isn't like the perfect vehicle, but he's better than a lot of the alternatives and now sadly it doesn't look like we're even going to get him, so once again get your eye off with the ball of the presidential shit, because at the end of the day there's nothing you can do at that level anymore, it's going to be this disgusting nightmare display, this these two zombies lash to the mass of this sinking ship, at this point all i want is debates, just give me debates please, i want to watch the debate. I want to get blitsed out of my mind and watch the debates, that's all I want out of this world, aliens can destroy the earth the day after the debates, I don't care, just let me see the dang debates between these two senscent monsters, sons debate too, please for the love of God. give me a son's debate, that one seems like it might even happen because the thing is is that if uh hunter is in any way under the sway of the party, like if if Tom Perez has like a body man on him who's keeping him narked up and doped and you know under surveillance and not in trouble, which I got to hope they're trying to do, because they got to know he's a wild card, if he's under control then he wants, he's not gonna honestly debate Don Jr. but if he gets wild, if he is like... off the reservation and he just does a couple bumps or maybe smok some crack and sees that and he might just on impulse agree to do it like let's do it tomorrow and then knowing don Jr. they're like yes do it on fucking periscope or something or tiktok before the DNC even knows he's doing it that's the only way it's going to happen and it's a possibility and boy I don't know I think I've been good enough lately that I want to get it but also if it doesn't happen the... was not meant to be, but somewhere, just come for yourself knowing that in some universe the sun's debate does happen, and it's amazing. a cursed cheeto, gentlemen, invading our own white house, the overall office, orange, the resolute desk. buried under a avalanche of orged dust, people aren't going to be able to get meat, this shit's going to get violent, i think you, i mean you know how meat fuel this country is, that death's got to go somewhere, you eat all that death, it's got to go somewhere, and if it's like built up and you can't. murdering with your mouth, you're going to murder with something else, that energy's got to go, all that pent up murder, all that pent up aggression, all that pent up social anima, all that. is going to have to go somewhere and if we can't eat burgers and chicky chicky fillets and pork rib sliders and oh boy man it is going to be a vast expression of uh kinetic energy there's going to be some kinetic scenarios i don't know when and i don't know where but in if people don't get meat there's going to be kinetic scenarios i don't think it's going to get to that point i think that the chinese are going to help synthesize is something that brings flows in to maintain America as that needed still and a non-replaceable, where else you going to go, where else you going to go? you can't empoverish Europe enough uh to fast enough to make them need all of the extra guiegos that we have to compensate for our alienated labor, and everywhere else you don't have developed enough markets to absorb all of that, we're the only place, so they're going to try to save us, and that might move us along a little bit and and stop us from having the worst possible outcome, it's all in our hands, that's why the grilling is for a reason, your honing your katana, whatever it may be, to go forward into battle when battle is joined, and however that might and manifest itself, and the thing is right now we're in one of the most liquid moments in history that i can recall experiencing, i think it's got to be number one, and so we got to wait for points of friction to emerge, and i'm waiting with you guys, it's it's an incredibly suspense. a moment, i feel i feel like it just suspended, i feel like i'm in uh, that thing in the remake of total recall when they go through the center of the earth and when you go around the middle they all just they're floating, i feel like we're in there, we are grilling, we are grilling and chilling, we are chilling and grilling. compound in Montreal, I'm thinking about a compound one way or the other, I'll say that. I don't know if anybody knows any way to secure a perimeter and create some sort of self-sustaining miniacal. that can facilitates some like you know fractal level of a more ideal social coordination some sort of uh uh some some sort of uh walden 3 that's what i'm thinking of that's what i want to build walden 3 i'm kidding no i don't want to do that i'm not leader get out of there is probably everyone's best if you can't get in with Kanye or Jared Letto, I think you're in trouble, uh, I think with Jared Letto, if you're a young woman uh, of a certain uh size and shape, say uh, I think you're probably going to get a better bet with Letto, uh, I think Kanye might be open to a bigger variety of people, uh, you're going to be able, you're going to have to vibe with him though, so uh, I hope you've been, I hope you really liked Jesus, I hope you're not just say to your friends that you like Jesus cuz'. It's going to be hard to get in if you don't really, really show him your enthusiasm for his work and how brilliant he is every moment. uh Jared lettos wald castle, that would be pretty cool, things move so fast on this chat, it's difficult. did somebody, what is this? oh, would i be, would i be Jesse ventura's vp? absolutely, are you kidding me? that would be the most fun thing that ever happened. how, how could I ever turn that down? i mean, that would be a ridiculous choice and it would never happened, but of course i would take that, that would be amazing. how would i even think twice about it? i could not think of a more perfect vision, more perfect. but as I say, I don't think that would be a smart of might move on their part, but I would still say yes, because I'm sorry, it wouldn't really matter one way or the other, I might as well have some fun, how many thousands of pages is my manifesto going to be, I'm trying to keep it short, no, no, there's will be no manifesto, I think I'm gonna try to write stuff though, just to refine ideas, like I know I talked a lot about doing an episode about American protestantism and sort of how it developed. and you know its implications for America's political economy are, and I've realized that a good test case to sort of see where at what level of abstraction I can kind of relate this stuff to, I'm going to try to write it out, I'm going to try to actually write it instead of doing it extemporaneously the way I've done all the other uh enebriated pasts, this one I'm going to try to write out uh like Mike Duncan or Patrick Wayman style and hopefully it's good and people find it. and if so i'll try probably be trying to write more, but i don't know yet what. uh, do i think UBI is inevitable? like i said, if they decide, if there is the will and ability to turn the spiggot on, the only way that that works is if you see. huge uh huge kenzian fill uh priming of the pump, like there will and it can't be through public works and stuff like that, because we wouldn't know where to put people, because all of those arms are dead, all those networks have died, it's going necrotic, so that means pure dump into the consumer economy uh through the through the inflationary vehicle of uh cash infusion uh and the thing is that we been doing that, and that's generally how we've been dealt, that's how we bumped out, slowly dumped out of the great recession was, but it was all at the level of quantitative easing, it was all at the level of direct cash into the marketplace at the highest level, which of course then gets captured at every level, so that by the time it gets to the consumer, it's a drizzle, i mean it is a trickle down, but it is a trickle, it is a little pisstream compared to how much money you're talking about, how much actual economic capacity you're representing in those transactions? so they could just dump a bunch of money into our economy and get us spending again and that'll it'll still be tough and it's still going to lead to a lot of fucking uh unemployment and it's going to lead to a lot of social disccohesion and like i said i would expect now the violent crime might rise uh in this context uh it might be a lagging indicator but i could see it it kind of popping up through the social firmament uh and obviously also all that fucking political, cultural tension that you see, that's only getting worse for sure uh, but also there could be a big infusion of cash at the level, like just bypassing the fucking bank level, direct provision that could like stave off the worst for now and leave us in a situation where you know we're talking about uh we could look back on this in 10 years and be like that looked like a real that was a close one but we made it and then you know if we haven't really changed things we're actually going to see the next big drop then but who's we can't know yet i don't know either it's a mystery it is mystery we are all still trapped in the in the wispy firmament of time and space in their eternal dance their eternal seductive uh caduceous like of riding snakes, you can learn if you if coding is something that makes sense to you, that would be a very useful skill to use that could like help you live in this world and make the world a better place, i mean i mean like i said, i think that we have... the capacity with our understanding of computer science now to solve a lot of the computational problems that undergird uh that challenge the the the validity or the the uh feasibility rather of of socialist uh central planning, i mean trying to get past those uh those signal uh mistrunslations in the economy uh that would obviate the need for the goddamn cash nexus in the first place you could... labomize the beast, but it's all has to be through the correct application of computer uh power and and uh and sorting and all that stuff, nothing I understand because... i've always hated that end of the on the stick, i can't get those symbols, the symbols of numbers, the symbols representing the material world, i can't get it, i'm a much higher level of abstraction, i always have been baby, just i have one of the most unbalanced brains in human history, i'll actually tell you guys something, this is a open truth moment, this is no bullshit, i took the grere uh which to to get into graduate school uh, i was going to be in, i was going to do, not with... with nothing really else to do, nothing to know what to do, i decided i would go to history, you know, that's a little lot of people in that in that questionable moment, you know, did is the like, okay, we'll go to grad school, uh, so I took the Jerry, and that's it was divided into a math or and a uh language section, right, and it's all percentiles of of the people who took it, so like if you get so whatever. you get that is the high that is the percentage of people you did better than who took the test and i think i was something like 96 or 97 percentile for the verbal portion which was good enough to get me into a middling uh uh graduate program but i swear to god i was something under i was like 10 percentile for math it was like 10 or 12 i mean i I can't, I mean, I'm just saying this to say that I do not understand numbers, I do not understand numbers in any way, and so I don't understand how computers work, but it really does feel like we could figure out a lot of these computing problems, if people were, if more people were doing that than fucking building apps that helped enslave people to gig economy jobs and just uh destroy existing uh uh job systems by uh by disrupting local regulatory regimes, doing something that's actually socially productive, and the thing is even if you have to work a real job you can still work towards that goal, just don't uh, don't give up too soon, don't give up the boat, don't give up the ship, my brain is dumb, i have a i have a dumb brain, i know i was, i'm just telling you guys, i'm telling you guys, i'm being honest and open, so people don't think i'm some sort of asshole because i i just want to let you guys know that i'm being honest with all this stuff and i'm coming from a position of good faith yes i my brain is bad it's like a gummed up uh it's like a gumned up uh pasta strainer that's my brain Oh, Dr. John Brinkley, I referenced him today, uh, Dr. John Brinkley is a fascinating American hugster, uh, he was a guy who, he really was like the nick Riviera of the American West, he was a fraudulent doctor because back then it was uh accreditation for medical uh uh professional was so thin that you could basically right into a... Jack box to get a thing that could get you paid to be a doctor somewhere, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, considering how tightly round in everything is now uh, but so this guy brinkly with his cracker jack uh diploma uh creates a miracle cure for impedance which involves the translation, the surgical implantation of goat testes into the male human gonadle sack. That's right, go natle sack, and that presumably, this is what he would tell the hill billies and plain folk who came to him, yeah, you're going to get the you're going to get the animal power of that goat and it's going to get you up, now this probably had some sort of effect because obviously a lot of uh erectile dysfunction is is psychosomatic, so I'm sure a number of people even after after that healed up they got hard and they were like, damn, thank you, Dr. briggle, but for the most part they would just get you know swollen balls, uh, a lot of them died, but anyway, he became incredibly popular for this, people came all over the world, he had, he had, he had a place in, he had a place in Kansas, hey, which, I'm sorry, sorry, he had a place in Kansas and he uh, and he where he was, he would, what do you call it, uh, on out of the people in Kansas, I got owned, I got owned. He would take the balls and he would put them in the sacks of... the people and he became incredibly popular uh and then eventually he got uh stripped of his ability to do it because people kept dying and it was a wildly uh um you know dangerous thing and then he ran for governor of Kansas and came pretty close he almost won it was really like mr when Mr Burns ran for governor you know because he wanted to stop having to pay taxes uh it was sort of the same thing he was going to become governor and then change the... rules so that he could practice medicine in Kansas again uh and he came pretty close but he didn't win and he ended up at a uh he ended up having to go to uh to um northern Mexico because they wouldn't allow him to operate in the United States and he built a giant array a giant radio array that was so powerful uh that it reached all the way across the continent United States and people as far away as like Oklahoma from the border could hear it in Bar fire and bed springs and shit, like that's how powerful it was, and funnily enough, that radio station became the place where the vast where most people in the country first heard country western music, which was like a regional phenomenon that uh got national exposure for the first time through his radio station, uh, yeah, so there you go, Dr. John Brinkley, he spread culture, and also horrible, horrible gonatal infection. yeah uh by sewing goat testicles into human scrollters. i haven't had that many drinks, thank you. What are we gonna do with all these goat balls? buddy, if I knew I would tell you, I'm sure we would all tell each other, because that's what the world economy's problem is going to be pretty soon with this huge dropping of dam in America, they're going to have a bunch of. borders for goat balls and nowhere to put them, so everyone's going to be wondering where to put the goat balls, which is why I think we might get a short-term UBI, like a monthly check shit, just so that we keep buying the goat balls, uh, because I think there might just be enough slack left in the system at this point to stop like runaway collapse, which I think I don't think anyone at the real top wants, because you know, I'm sure they'll be fine with living in their New Zealand bunkers, but I think they would rather be able to go skiing and stock. and you know going to uh if they're pretentious enough going to you know the lincoln center and seeing uh the the opera you know oh yes if you oh yes if you bend to Bangkok oh oh the commodores feast at lord Falcon's palace is exquisite they like that stuff and they don't want it to go away so presumably that will prevent them from allowing just to freefall into oblivion and the only real way they can do that without a powering workers too much, which they do not want at all, uh, is just dumping money into the system, so yeah, I think we might be seeing a short-term UBI in the very near future, sometimes you get too excited with the goballs. uh Elfred Korzibski is a guy that my friend Rob was hipping me to today who I think I heard about he's actually one of the foundational minds behind neurl linguistic programming uh but a lot of his uh the stuff that he talked about is uh very similar to what I've been trying to explain so I feel like he's a useful person like if somebody is you know at the right uh you know confidence. with material if they're trying to figure out what I'm talking about, I think Koribski gets a lot of it, not all of it, but he gets a good chunk, and he should be, I think reading korzibski and Marks i think are very useful, I think that reading Corzibski against Marks could be very useful, in making the person doing both, understand both of them uh better, so I would say uh korzibski is a interesting figure that I want to engage with more in the future, so shout out to good old Elfred Cor'. Oh is John Ditor the guy claimed that he call he was a time traveler is that the guy who said who who? would write to a uh to a forum and claimed to be from the future and said that like the country was going to collapse, wasn't that him? yeah, that was funny, i never read enough of it, but uh, respect to anybody who would go that deeply into a character, that's a great bit, and you know what, at this point uh, maybe he was real, who knows? I'm pretty much choping everything, I'm kind of thinking time travel could happen, just not the looper time travel or back to the future where like something happens to you in the future here and like your arm get no fuck off, that doesn't happen, but you could have time travel, sure, why not as a treat, we could have a little time travel as a treat, I we just did laundry, I've got plenty of new clean laundry, oh my god, Jeff Gannon, that's a blast from the past, I guarantee you, what per, all right, I'll just do a test, no guest, no bullshitting, just like, I'm honestly asking you, don't look it up, do you know who? Ganon is, dude, does that ring a bell? because I got to believe most of these kids listening to this or watching this who are, I got to believe it like 20s, have no idea, yeah, I'm getting nothing, nothing, what kind of amazing mutant would be on here, asking me about Jeff Gannon, how old are you dude, are you can't be as old as me, that seems impossible that there's anyone older than me on here, I feel like the oldest man in twitch history, oh man, Jeff Gannon was a guy who was in the white. was press core during the Bush administration w and he would give these softball questions about how like uh Mr. Rumsfeld America loves the troops more than ever uh how can they help them express their love to the troops that kind of thing you know uh poll show that uh Bush is actually the smartest person to ever live how does he feel about being such a vision to everybody and people eventually kind of said what is the deal and it turned out that he represented like a fake moony website and that he als had a side hustle as a male prostitute uh in DC, specializing in like political figures, there are some people who think that he was actually Johnny gosh, the uh franklin credit ring abducted kid, I have no idea if that's true or not, it's a funny, it's certainly an amusing idea, but that's god that's such a blast in the past, man, just think if you kids, think about all the stuff that's going to blow your... mind when you imagine kid kids aren't going to know anything about including i mean if we make it this far Trump being president like the just the absurdity of that they're going to have no actual memory of how are you even going to communicate it unless we've so far transcended it by then that it won't even be a meaningful thing but if that's the case i don't think we're going to be doing anything other than uh cormic macaroing it as they say. I'm glad somebody remembers Jeff Ganon, I believe his real name was Jeff Guckert or something. It's really nice out tonight, it's excellent, beautiful, apparently it's going to be all stormy tomorrow, so probably want to button up, but real nice today, I'm glad I got to be outside a little bit, experience this backyard, happy to have a little patch, even though it's basically just a little shack. here, but uh, yeah, gives me a little bit of a little sun, otherwise I would probably be vitamin D deficient if I'm not already, I've had two doctors look at me with my shirt off and say, okay, I think you need to take vitamin D, Oh yeah, the gucker guy, the the Jeff Ganon guy definitely was like an associate of Roger Stone if you know what I mean, you know, people who associate with Roger Stone, like the people he would solicit in that uh uh personal ad him and his wife looking for hung studs, but I love it, you know, he's better than the Manaford, Manaford was a monster, he was awful, he was evil polly, it looked like Roger stone was ethical pally, his wife seemed very much into it, yeah. but he seems like kind of a jerk in other areas. I would not be surprised if Roger stone had go testies. Ooh, the black. black eagle trust, the black eagle trust is a fun esoteric conspiracy theory uh that says that after world war 2 the us uh took into its possession a massive amount of uh gold from the Japanese government or Japanese high officials or something and that it was never declared and it was used as like the basis uh as a fund for to fund basically every like evil CIA plot that has gone on since World War II uh to me it's like fun but it also seems beside the point like had plenty of ways to get money that didn't involve having to have Japanese gold, for one thing there was the nazi gold, and the other thing is that there was the post-ward drug trade, which they immediately got their beaks wet in, and also there's the black funds that are never accounted for, the trillions and trillions of dollars just in the defense department of budget alone that are unreconciled and and unreconcilable, it's just never going to be resolved. It's money that's in a quantum state forever, which really does tell you that this idea that we could like run out of money is absurd, like the money just went into the it went it went into a black hole, it didn't even disappear, they can't even account for it, that's different, it's like a it's like a it's like a uh it's floating in space, it's it's like it's like a giant uh the the pentagon is like a giant shrodeger box filled with like 20 trillion uh schrodiger bucks. that both exist and don't exist at the same time, a little bit of clapping, I'm not looking at the fly over, no, thank you, I don't even know where it would be, I'm not near where the thing is flying, I'm way up in the, I'm in the middle of Brooklyn, so I don't think I would even see it, so yeah, there's plenty of money for them to go around, they don't need ch, they don't need Japanese gold, you know, it's like so, how does that determine the outcome of a... is what i don't understand so, but it's fun, they're all fun, the gemstone files, if anyone knows the gemstone files, those are hilarious, i i got into that shit in high school, i got a like a print off on a dot matrix printer of the skeleton key to the gemstone files and i read that shit about how Aristotle onasus was like the global god crime kingpin who assassinated everybody and him and howard hewis basically ruled the entirety of the post war uh western a economy and pulled the strings of everything, using heart attack potions and shit, excellent stuff, very fun, hearing the people like applauding, it's like. as long as people know that it's not enough, you know, as long as people use this moment to remember what their duties are to each other, i think it's good, you know, and it's like it could be either for everyone, and i think people end up fighting because they assume there can only be way one way, but it's you know, it's it's always a degree of both, so it's worth tending to the good part rather than yelling at the bad part, maybe i don't know, perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, righteous gemstone f That's nice, Virgil's doing okay, I talked to him on about Rick and Morty, uh, I, I tweeted, I, I texted to him, he gave me, he's he's apparently a big fan of the new episode, so he's doing all right, he can still appreciate good comedy, he still has the requisite IQ to appreciate Rick and Morty and all of its intricuse. All right guys, it's been an hour, uh, good to talk to you, I'll see you guys tomorrow, we'll delve into some more stuff, uh, I'll maybe I'll have a few uh for stuff prepared too, we'll do a little uh less free form maybe, I don't know, we'll talk, see you guys, bye-bye.
