 Welcome to the chat room, we got takes and games, we got everything you want, and also some tain, we got the people where you find any meme you need, if you've got the tokens, baby, we are your machine. What's up guys, I'm back, not Joey's world tour though, not. yet one of these days, one of these days I'm just going to start housing snacks and uh explaining how they taste pretty good, pretty good, uh, it was very rainy earlier today, and then it was windy, apparently this part of some tropical storm, and now it's beautiful, humidity's gone, I don't how long it lasts, but I'm living lavidaloka currently. someone wants a woop woop woop, i can give you one of those, woop woop boop b uh, so i wanted to uh start by closing my end of a uh hilarious online, i guess back and forth, back and diagonal, maybe back and perpendicular, be more accurate uh between me and uh someone on twitter who has been talking about me being a gateway to uh to naziism uh i talked about it a little bit i read a tweet thread last time and couldn't stop laughing because of how funny it was and of course that led to foder and another round of tweeting and i just wanted to say okay this has been fun, i think it's been funny but now it's time to stop on my end anyway because if you can't know if you can't see how sterile and doomed any kind of engagement like that is i can't what to tell you it can only provide the like the joy of owning and uh and and doing mind combat it cannot resolve anything so seeking it seeking to have a do that which a lot of people do online uh is a fantasy and i want i don't want to i want to stop uh i know it's a work in progress like trying to disengage from online and it's going to take a very long while uh, but one way for me anyway is to recognize a bad pattern and just end it, but I did want to say something publicly though, because I just wanted to point out how perfect an example this thing is of the way that nobody online actually is trying to persuade anyone of anything, all they are doing is building heat around their persona, like their professional wrestler, and it's about pitching to a already established specific fan base of people who respect them, maybe give them money for some sort of media endeavor or activism uh and and that involves conflict uh, and that involves picking fights, and that involves getting responses, so when I started responding, that was heroin into the veins, I mean as much as the tweets might have been hysteric and oh my god, look what he's doing, doesn't he realize that he's he's... is normalizing the hank pill and is going to lead to fash uh uh mass shootings all over America, doesn't he care, but in reality she's thrilled to get a response that she can further uh use to further the the the the illusion of a meaningful contest there, uh, but at no point is any of this stuff geared towards a as i mean I read the I read the stuff and I talked about how just hearing it out loud was startling considering how a obscure and weird it was uh and that just goes to show that the unengageed the undecided are not considered in this dialogue like there's no question about getting people who aren't on the team uh it's about people who already agree with you on all this stuff and that means that if they get if you get attack back that's just more grist for the mill and that's and that's why you know I don't mind doing it for a little bit because I don't think it's bad for me it's not like I'm scared of oh no I'm going to get cancelled by her uh and it's not like I even think what she's doing is like terribly. terrible, it's honestly a fun diversion, it's like a nice little place to rift for most people or to get their like anti-fascist hysteric anxiety out, either way they're having a good time, like a person tweeting about a person sweating over their tweets about who they're going to like expose, what what fash they're going to dox in their war against fash uh, every time they see a honk pill meme or they see me uh triggering their like the ruob goldberg uh contraption that connects me. to like a fucking uh the Walmart uh texas school uh the Walmart texas shooter whatever uh you know the the the lines of uh of dominoes uh of course like it's horror it's horror and fear but that horror and fear is tinged it's tinged with with pleasure and everyone who's making fun of these goof balls they're having a good time right out there in the open but they're both having fun and that's fine everyone's got to do something on the internet. um, might as well have some fun, and I think this is honestly relatively harmless, because the people who uh are wrapped up in this stuff, give them a busy box, I would rather them have them be online trying to stop the fascists on Twitter uh, than doing something helpful, which would undoubtedly be a massive disaster, because if you if your ability to like uh sift signal from noise, if you're ability to uh distinguish. things by like meaning by like uh uh with like gradiants of meaning if if you're if you have any sort of uh faculty for observing reality and giving it some sort of uh i don't like a a emotional and uh and uh epistemic triage i guess where you you i guess i'm just trying to say where you understand there's a real there's a difference between the internet and reality, when you understand there's a difference between subculture, online and politics, then uh, if you have that understanding, none of this stuff is is makes sense to you, and if you don't have that understanding, you sure shit should not be trying to deal with people who can in the real world, it will be a disaster, uh, and uh, so good, stay there, keep fighting the good fight, and even you know, hey, patreons for fighting the fash go for it, it's a nice little busy box for people whose basic ability to understand the world is not sufficient to the task of activism. because uh, i just want to say one of the accusations that was through at me is that like i was playing dumb about the reality of the clown pill or hanking or whatever, like acting like it wasn't a real like wasn't a real thing, it wasn't a real subculture that was really out there uh, and it's like, no, I know it's real, I've heard about it before this, of course, I'm, I was extremely online, for god sakes, I know about the stupid clown world bullshit, uh, but not only is she asking an audience to take seriously the idea that that clown pill is a genuine gateway towards uh real violence in the world, and not just in the proximate trigger of like, well this alienated psycho who hated uh everyone. uh also enjoyed this meme, i'm sorry, i'm not buying that, but that approximate trigger thing, that's that's how you got the the moral hysteria around uh video games and uh and films and i know that's now it's now it's actually hip on the left to talk like that, but i i'm still holding out the good fight that no, that's not the thing, that's meaningless to the real questions of the structural causes of any kind of violence, including uh isolated blownwolf uh murder, by the way uh it is interesting to me that these people are fixated on the concept of fascism, right? which is a, which is in large part defined as a mass political movement that uses organized legal and extra legal violence to uh assert power in a political arena. what what what they have decided is the thing that they could actually like pull out of this as a as a genual as an actual justification for why care about this stupid bullshit online? is will some of these guys? end up shooting up a a Walmart or or killing a neighbor or something, and that's true, but by fixating on that, you've basically undermined any meaningful definition of fascism, because fascism cannot be isolated people doing uncoordinated acts of violence, you think the brown shirts were just reading the doker beaker and then deciding to go out and punch a fucking uh communist. think they would have taken over Germany if they'd done that? like your definition of fascism is just lake capitalist enemy, it's just the it's it's that means columbine is uh is fascism and "the thing is is that kind of violence is a sign of a social of a society in decay at the level of its social fabric, which militates against the idea that there's enough of a social fabric to to generate a mass political movement that would be fascism, so they're already, even that the beginning, they've shit in their own foundation by going with a mechanism for what fascism it is, and where it comes from that is idealist fantasy that uh genuinely misunderstands not only the difference between uh media and reality but the difference uh between uh like fascism and just anti-social behavior uh and so that that's our they're off the bad start there uh but not only do you have to buy that and idea you then have to say that this honkler bullshit is similar enough to the grill pill to mean that if you listen to the my streams or you will be more likely to then switch over to hanking on the hank pill and then maybe eventually because of the hank pill people going on to shoot somebody like that's how you allied the idea like like the absurdity of saying i'm going to cause fascist school shootings uh by saying no no Matt won't but he will get people to take more seriously the idea of the clown or the hank pill uh and that that's the moral contagion fantasy, that is the the confusion of symbols for reality that happens when you have completely detached from a material understanding of the world. once that happens, you are in cloud kucu land, you are untethered, and your analysis will only become more arcan and self-referential and self-justifying, it will get denser, it will require a greater greater degree of... weird conspiratorial logic and and leaps of logic and symbolic confusion, like this whole thing basically starts because two things have the word pill in them, that's the essential thing, this is that they are able to take superficial symbolic similarities and extrapolate from that layers of meaning and that are fully fabricated in their heads, and that is why when when said met's not. I said, thank you, I'm not, I don't, the entire framing of that, the entire framing of this movement, the entire framing of this moment, as a battle of ideas online between fascists, and and and socialists is wrong, and it's a misapplication of energy, and I'm glad, yes, I'm not involved in that, good, and of course, the double absurdity of that is that you're literally not even talking. about any kind of group, I mean the only people who want to argue that antifa is coherent are its supporters and the Trump administration so that they can claim it as a boogie man equal to MS13 or ISIS uh but reality is that there's no or there's no coherence to it either just as there the antifash are unorganized just like the fash are because you are operating at a symbolic level removed from the reality because the reality is is that people involved in politics to the point caring enough to go rumble in the streets about it form a very distinct minority of Americans that are that are uh generally classified along a certain age specifically specifically age and demographic groupings and geographic groupings and and that their influence on the political system is secondary at most real action is happening uh or at least the the only way that the... this ship can be steered away from its uh course towards towards apocalypse involves activating a number of people that simply will never be brought around by this sort of politics by this understanding of politics. numbers are the name of the game and the only thing that matters right now, anybody wants to talk about fewer but better, it's like motherfucker, we're starting from zero almost, and i mean the Bernie Sanders campaign was an attempt to... build capacity and I think it did leave some capacity, like all all these all these waves leave some, you know, they they lap on the shore and they bring with them some sediment that like builds some foundational elements and they you know there's like there's some stuff that was left over after 2016 that wasn't there before 2000 uh uh and then 2020 but it's still totally insufficient and that what happened to Bernie in those in those later primary states those less politicized uh primary states uh that had less like that have a more, i guess a less engaged, i guess i would use the word uh uh voting group, i guess like. less politically wrapped up beyond beyond the way the people watch fox news, which is other millions of people, still not a huge amount amount, but more, certainly more uh economically influential because of their advanced age and therefore uh their larger control of capital uh, but still a minority, but those people um, those people weren't paying attention to any of this shit, they weren't paying attention to... any of this shit the whole time, like anything about what we were doing on our show, like scared people away because we were too mean or whatever the hell to the poor warren supporters or anything else, or the idea that like Bernie wasn't wasn't uh, he was too woke, Bernie was too woke, he talked too much about trans bathrooms or something and that scared away the normals, no, no one was paying attention to any of it at all, and when it came to come time to to vote. it just went clunk now some people were paying attention in that older white suburbanites were paying attention to Bernie and freaking out about it and and voted Nmas for Biden like uh that was a a genuine mobilizing factor but there was no the thing is that was built in that was going to happen Bernie was a credible camp challenge to the Democratic Party he was going to arouse conflict not only with the party hierarchy but with sectors the richer sectors of its party base uh and so that was inevitable but it was "the only way it was going to be defeated was by engaging the vast number of people who were not involved in politics at all uh or at a very superficial level and that didn't happen, and if that didn't happen, it is my opinion that stuff that's even more eseteric and even more fine-grained and even more nestled with assumptions and value uh like assumptions about reality, assumptions about uh uh morality." assumptions about uh politics and economics built into it that are not shared, like that's why so many people like to assume bad faith, one of the big reasons people assume bad faith is because like i've said about uh people worrying like well what what about murder is if it's if if you abolish police uh or abolish prison and people say you know you act like no one's writ about this plenty people have written about this. don't act like this isn't uh this is new, you're just you're just pretending not to know that about that so that you can uh be uh a sea lion like i'm sorry no no there's plenty of people who have not done the reading who are not have not assimulated the entire concept either to reject it or embrace it they're hearing it for the first time but ever but then not just that like on all sides of of the of the onlinee left and right there is a assumption that there that you start talking to somebody about politics and at some point you're going to connect, there's going to be like a little latching on between your understanding and the symbolic language and metaphores that you used to describe it and their understanding of the world, something's going to click and then like the theory of one of the big theories of uh behind uh socialism and marxism is that if you're trying to get that connection between people, material interests are the best way to do it uh because it's the most because it's the least individualized uh and that it can be, it it's it's it's common among uh uh a wide swath of people that could hypothetically organize around that, but at this point even the way people are understanding and thinking about uh uh material concerns are now so abstracted or and and on the other side among people who aren't engaged with politics uh uh those ideas are so buried that now there isn't even a place to click them together, there's no... to get the latch latching, but all this stuff just perpetuates just, it's people winding each other up within a within a subculture, it's a subculture, you know, it's like people think about political subcultures and they say, well what are political subcultures and they're like, well you got your tankies and your anarchists and your sock dems and your hanklers and your I'd say no, no, no, no, no, no, no. that is, I'd say that politics is the subculture, I would say that having investment in political ideology, especially beyond a party preference, which a lot of people have who are otherwise normal, is a subculture, and all that other stuff that people fight to the death about is essentially just shading, it's uniform so you know who's who, like it is the the NFL, and then the tankies and the suck dems and the clown honklers and and the proud boys or whatever, they're the teams in the league who play and we're in the stands watching, we're football fans. and I think the reason people make that mistake, like obviously a lot of is is is computer insanity, and I think that's a real phenomenon that we are not talking enough about, like I've talked about MK Ultra as, I've talked about like the internet is both like a continuation of MK Ultra and also the lead in the pipes of the of the fucking our version of the Roman empire uh, but that's not just it, I think there's other significant contributed. and I think a big one has been the uh and of course this is all facilitated by the internet but it's not only a product of the internet and that is the the the the fixation on Grampshian wars of cultural position standing in for material politics and I know a lot of people do that not out of malice but because that is what can be fought like what do you do about material conditions how do you engage that realistically in a depositicized? country with basically zero class consciousness and no unified working class to speak of, either geographically, uh, ethnically, anything, uh, so of course the cultural firmament becomes the only place to play, and I feel like one of the big misunderstandings of these uh, critiques of of uh, like the new of um, the critiques of the critical theory tradition from the Frankfort school to the postmodernis and all that, and there's this... there is a current of blaming them for the that cultural turn in in on the left, and I don't really think that's the case, I think that the cultural turn on the left was inevitable, as soon as as soon as the the the material war ended, uh, especially after that wall fell, what was left, but the cultural uh terrain, so that's I think the main contributor, once again, the material driver of the cultural turn, not, not because people were reading stuff, but uh, I think the re'. that those thinkers get so uh it became totemic and their concepts became used to build this this tower bable about um about culture is because they were describing how culture operates in capitalism like that was that was the the the the the project this is what this is how capitalism especially like 20th and 20th century technocapitalism this is how it operates as a governing ideology in culture, that's what they were tracing, and over time, especially after that peskyy material uh, collapse of the left, that overtime turned into a um, in people's minds, I think even, not even consciously, that went from a description of this is what culture is under capitalism, to a normative argument that like this is what society is always, that this that this is not contingent and more importantly that it's not just culture, that it's not, it's not the way that the that material relations form a culture, it's the way that culture takes over and becomes the entire terrain, and that that's where the errors came in, i think, that's where the snake swallowed its own tail, but that doesn't mean that the insights are inherently wrong, it's just that you're talking about, you're talking about the like the uh, the shadow. you're talking about the shadows on on the wall uh and and describing the shadows on the wall accurately that has use, but it should not be mistaken for the totality of reality, which is how it has become thought of, which is what allowed people to turn all this analysis on its head and say, oh you know the way that uh material culture creates all these uh racial and and uh you know gender uh oppressions and stuff, well if we stop those that'll end up uh filtering down into the material reality somehow when in reality that's not what happens, but then you get people, but that but that leads to confusion on on both sides, because anytime I see anybody arguing about yelling about feminism and saying that saying the making first they make a point that I think is totally accurate, they say, look at what modern feminism, as it has been culturally metabolized, tells women about what their life should be, it should be... a pursuit of career, that that is, and everything else should be subsidiary to that, career, family first, or career first and family and everything else, and that that's that's that's how, that's how you actualize, if you if you do it the wrong way, you will be, you will find yourself at some point thwarted uh, and they'll say, but everyone's miserable, all these women who do that, all these women pursue their careers are miserable, uh, so what the fuck, and that's a... That's a very good point, I mean it's it's a it's an observation of reality anyway, uh, but uh, the then they blame feminism for it, the idea being that, oh, the feminism convinced all these women that they needed to go. get a job? no, the American economy stop being able to support one family house uh, one uh income households, that's what happened, used to be able to raise a family, in fact for most of human history, you could raise a family on one income, and for the first time in human history, anywhere really, that was no longer possible, and then feminism becomes of course, feminism emerging from that, cops, gives you the the cope, like that's what culture does, it it metabolizes alien. the specific alienation uh and trauma that the social that the material order creates and then it creates a mirror cultural version that's attempts that is designed, i mean not designed but emerges sort of like as a white as a immune system for capitalism to transfer that alienation into some uh carrot on the end of a stick that you can go off it's like yeah this sucks but have you considered this and that's what feminism is like yeah this sucks but if it wasn't for uh those that sexis that job would be better, it's not that it work is alienating, it's not that no one should try to raise a family on to uh with both uh people working, that's not ideal, and it's it's it's it's not necessary uh, i mean it's it's uh, it's it's it's inherently corrosive to to like the the structure of a family, it is, it just is, it's pressure, pressure makes it human interactions difficult of all kinds. uh and and that's why it should be relieved uh, but instead of focusing on the fact that the one the one income household is impossible now for most people, people want to argue about whether it's feminism fault that women are miserable in jobs and delaying marriage and delaying kids or having kids and then not being able to make it work or anything like that. if you take away if feminism loses tomorrow, if the if the if the red pill uh... takes over uh, then people still aren't going to be able to fucking live uh as a family with one income and women are going to have to keep be in the fucking workplace and all the horrible shit that they talk about about uh about the destabilized home life of lake capitalist America is recreated and you could argue, well yes, but if we got rid of the feminism, then you could get people on board with some sort of redistributed. program uh that would have like a family uh friendly policy. well, if you haven't gotten rid of capitalism, then and in the the moment we live in, which is a a terminal crisis of capitalism and a a crisis of profitability that is irreversible. uh, there is no, there is no room in the at the end for any kind of radical redistribution. so any politics that that incorporates like the the conventional order. is not going to be able to demand to make any demands other than superficial ones, and then what do you end up having is, oh, you know, divorce was banned or some shit, and it'll won't have any real effect and it'll sublimate all the fucking uh alienation that you claim to have been curing, but and the other thing is is okay, you you've made your peel to these people who don't like feminism. and now you've got them on board, what's this? you lost the people who are are who do think that women should have that there should be uh like a role for women in the workplace and that and that you shouldn't have to stay uh to have two jobs but if a woman wants to work they should hell men should be able to stay home and that if women are in the workplace they sure as hell deserve to not have uh to face sexism in the workplace uh and that those are not that. totally reasonable argument too, and you could point, and they could point to the misery of the the pre-liberated housewife, which was significant, uh, and they're they're they're right too, and you're not going to convince them otherwise, is the important thing, and so oh, you got them, and now you've lost them, and that means you have a new political configuration, you have a new constituency, and once again, it's too little, it's too small, you, it's like uh, the fucking esab's fable where the the mouse, the the fox has the grape in his mouth. and he walks by the water and he and he sees it and he tries to get it and he drops opens his mouth and drops it in the water and he loses both of them that's what will happen either one of those like we need to set serious about like setting the terms for the left of it being like radically hostile to religion and the family okay great this is america what do you think you're doing you are you are guaranteeing minority status but if you say the other side no we need like an aggressively trad uh socialism well then you've lost the other. the only way to uh to overcome that is to fucking recognize that feminism isn't the problem one way or the other and that if you want to have it be a woman wh works in the workplace or if you want to be a woman and stay home, you should be able to do either, because people should be able to live with uh without it being tied to a a fucking compelled uh exploitation of their fucking labor, because both are true, the idea of all women should have a job is insane, the idea that all women should stay home is also insane. but we went from uh tacitly uh endorsing one, although it was never true for working class women, working class women always worked uh to mandating it through the market, so the so the coersion is invisible, we don't see the coersion, so we just say, ah, it's feminism that made all those women go to work and get miserable, of course I'm talking about liberal feminism, I'm talking about hegemonic, cultural feminism, the kind people are always arguing about, if you want to no true Scotsman me, you can, but do that about literally everything, because the thing is people could say, well like even liberal feminism recognizes you know choice and recognizing, but that's not what the terrain of argument ever is, it's always on difference, and the difference is always the most epimeral and least connected to reality thing, because it's because you're trying to find an argument, i am not broken, i'm totally normal and cool right now, so that's just to say long way of saying, half an hour long way of saying that uh that honk pill shit, i'm done with it, that honk pill shit, i'm done with it, still uh, still marginalizing uh uh voices though, bayroot, i mean they say there was a bunch of ammonium nitrate stored at the dock and a bunch people have said it looks like a fertilizer explosion so i don't know it seems to me to be maybe it's an raiger situation, things like that happen all the time, they're going to happen more and more, decaying infrastructure leads to uh disasters and catastrophes and there's a desire to see everything is geopolitical uh chess match, but one of the one of the fact one of the conditions of the great game is a steadily increasing amount of mayham created by our decaying and destroyed institutions, but man those videos were insane. how the hell could have been a nuke? that's my favorite one, it's like hasn't everyone seen every like oceans 11? it's like it's like a nuclear bomb but without the bomb so say hiroshimo you get in the noise century they have nuclear bombs have electromagnetic pulses that go with them and what they do is they knock out all electronic equipment in a given area so you're close enough to fucking have recorded it. like that and have your windows flow out, your phone would have been fried, thank you, halifax, halifax, munitions dump, blew up in halifax, world war 1, i think a lot of it is people just want, people want, people want everything to be the most it could be at any moment now, because we've... everything or we think we have and so if something's going to happen it has to be the most and part of that is because how are we going to have a take if it's not the most if it's just another thing yeah texas city we need someone's. uh, I don't know where this came from, but I don't know why it amused me so much, but someone in chat just demanded that we uh, that we that what America needs is a former uh Ganian uh Hunta leader Jerry Rollings, very amusing to me, Rawlings is an interesting cat, I got to say, Rawlings is not does not fit the mold from... like post colonial um African strong men uh because uh, he was sort of a cincinatis type guy and that he would take a cow take over and then he would leave and then he would come back after everything got fucked up again uh yeah like an all yeah like a reluctant dictator yeah now i always have a soft sprot for Jerry Rawlings also just because that's a really cool name he sounds like a like a 70s uh baseball player I got a Jerry Rollings rooking card. uh, if the universe is infinite, well the universe isn't infinite, i mean it's it's expanding, so i mean it's infinite and that's everything, it is everything, but there's space, dude, there's a lot of space, it takes a long time for life to travel through it, a long long time, and they're all over the place. Nothing is outside the universe, come on, there's nothing outside the universe, if you have to think of a three dimensionally, universe is uh, it's like a ball, it's an expanding ball, like say, well, what's outside the ball? it's like, well, no, there's nothing outside the ball, it's just the ball expanding, best, no, no, the universe, the multiverse is not outside the universe, i think that the multiverse is simultaneous to the universe, they're all on top of each other. They're all happening in the same in the same balloon. I don't think Mob D is about polytheism, it's about pantheism. In the in the great European pantheist tradition of Spinoza, but I do think that uh, like black holes, people say where where do black holes lead, I think it's all internal. It's all and it's like the there are areas of uh of super density where there's if there is if there is possible travel between dimensions that's where it is uh big yeah i'm actually fully on board with the eternal recurrence theory, big bang, big crunch, like a squeeze box, but within that squeeze box are all of the squeeze boxes, all the universes, all the earth, all the everything, squeezing, but not at the same rate, and the thing that and like all that, and if you say how, i don't know, 90% of the universe is literally a question mark, it's probably somewhere in there, it's like, yeah, you know that dark matter stuff that's just a big hole and they're like, well the... something there so we got to call it something, maybe something's there, huh? i don't know math enough to figure it out. uh, somebody posted the good uh line from uh movie dick that i would like to read. after pip the uh the cabin boy is thrown overboard during a wailing mission and he's on the water for hours before they pick him up and afterwards he's he's mad uh and and he it's pip saw the multitudinous god omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heave the colossal orbs he saw god's foot upon the treddle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad. i know that feeling you know what's really? fun about funny about that chapter though uh or about the about the book in general and then that chapter kind of uh presages it is that so it talks about yeah pip went crazy uh he was out there in the water and you know when you go out there in the water it's just you and god and and your brain can't handle it you know and you come back and you're not you're not the same uh and and then at the end of that chapter he kind of says yeah you know that that came that's that insight uh keep that in mind basically he tells the audience and then of course spoiler alert uh at the end of the book Ahab or I'm sorry, after Ahab and the crew of the the peak water all killed by Moby Dick, Ahab floats alone on Queg's. often uh for I think a day before uh before he's taken and that's like sort of the punch line of the book is that the book has been written by somebody who had that experience the pip had got to say it really is really good I know it's stupid to say nobody dick's good but I feel like for a long time I didn't want to read it cuz most of those good books aren't really fun you and I know fun isn't the only thing but part of it, i think that's the big thing i didn't realize, like i thought it'd be great and i thought it would be profound, but i didn't realize how fun it would be, oh it's so fun, it is one of the most fun books you can read in my opinion, i kind of want to um, stone wall jackson was an absolute uh mutant, stonewal wow, stonewall Jackson, so I don't know how many people know about this particular weirdness of Stonewall Jackson uh, but among other things, he was convinced that one of his arms was thicker in diameter than the other, and that as a result, when he had his arms to his side, one of them accumulated blood uh, to and it would get heavy, and so occasionally during the day he would hold up his arm over his head to let the blood flow back into his body, uh, he also sucked on lemons all day. uh and was generally a word, i think he's probably on the spectrum, i would say, he seems like a good candidate among civil war generals, if i was gonna say the most likely spectrum uh world war or i'm sorry civil war general, i got to go jackson number one with a bullet, i think and i don't think it's close honestly uh, he was also he was a prick, fuck him, he got killed by his own guys, which is hilarious, i really... i i hope that it got out who shot him and then over the whole course of the war they just got like bullied by the rest of the army of northern Virginia like hey try to yeah hey when you want to shoot the yankees just think of stonewall jackson you fucking traiters idiots i did see gods and generals in the theater i have not seen the five-hour extended edition and i do not hate myself enough to ever it is a genuinely terrible and it's not just because of the... although the politics are genuinely wetched uh and honestly as someone who loved gettiesburg as a kid and loved Joshuans chamberland and loved Jeff Daniells as Joshuance Chamberlin, his turn in Gods and generals is a betrayal, like he's not barely in it, and his one big scene is he he does a a Shakespeare quote about Caesar crossing the Rubicon implicating the Union Army as the the military that is uh going to overthrow democracy. and overthrow the republic, why would why would chamberlin say that? it's like, yep, the guy, said, the the guy had the fucking speech in gettiesberg about we on army set to sent other men free, all of a sudden like a year earlier, he's like, yeah, we're here to subjugate the fucking uh, the senate and and the republic and burry democracy, fuck him, but anyway, uh, terrible performances, awful beards, uh, uh, but I think the worst thing about it is just how boring it is, there's only one fun scene and it's a scene where a bunch of confederate generals sit around the campfire and watch some fancy theater man sing uh the bonnie blue flag, one of the senators by the way was sitting uh uh Virginia senator, one of one of the generals was Virginia Senator George Allen who was uh on a fast track to uh being the successor to George Bush and then he was uh totally destroyed by a political scandal that looking back on it, it's insane to imagine that it happened only what, it was 2000, i think it was 2006, yeah 2006, only 14 years ago, it feels like something that happened in the fucking like the era of good feeling, it seems like it should have ended with a duel, like oh yeah he was on he was on he was recorded on tape saying a a obscure North African slur for like a a dark skinned person or like a native, people had to bucking bust out a dictionary even to make sense of the uh of the accusation and it still took this guy from the line to be president and he lost the seat to Jim Webb by the way to born fighting Scott Shairshash Jim Webb but the worst part about gobs and generals by far is that like most civil war uh movies. It saves on money and uh budget, or I mean it saves on the budget and it saves on just ease of making the film uh by hire bringing in real civil warrian actors. to play the soldiers, because they already have the equipment, they know how to march and do all the lines, the military formations uh, and so it's way easier than than hiring actors and having to drill them and equip them, but the problem is is that American civil war reinactors are fucking fat suburbans, they're fat middle ages and you watch these battles and there's a line of confederate soldiers, confederate soldiers going up and some guy gets shot and he's like a 300 pound fucking... butterball turkey, he's got like a red face, it's like is he actually does he have a does he have a uh, is he wearing a lary of the cable guy hat instead of a keppy? the average civil war soldier was a fucking rail thin teenager or near to it anyway, there's just big and they just stand there and they go bang and then they fall over and of course there's no blood and i mean i'm sorry but the civil war was noted for it. it was, it was the first, one of the first large-scale conflicts that took napoleonic tactics and married it to you, indust post-industrial revolution military technology, which would did not account for it, oh no, the guns aren't supposed to be that good, when you stand in a big line and you shoot at each other, the guns can only be so good, and it's like, no, no, we got rifling in the barrels now, and you can shoot them way faster, oh fuck, no, this is bad, but they had nothing to do, so I mean they improvide. like they they were doing fucking like world war one trench shit by petersburg by the end of the war but it took a while and that's one of the big reasons that robert elee is such a fucking asshole uh uh overrated motherfucker is that he was a fully invested napoleonic dipshit and and I mean he it's like people remember uh picked charge but that wasn't even his only dumb frontal assault. uh malvern hill during the seven days was his first, it was another ass kicking, and he'd seen the union army get just its ass kicked doing uh full frontal assaults on entrenched positions, he done it at Fredriksberg, what the it is good that war is so terrible, less we grow found of it, what a little, what a sanctimonious prick, nothing redeeming about that guy, if anybody if somebody likes him you can put them on the pay no mind list because there's nothing to like, wildly overrated. uh he got his ass kicked by mcclellen most of the times they fought and mclellen was a fucking moron uh and then the other wins he w racked up it's like he's like uh Roberty Lee is the general equivalent of a college football team that just racks up uh um racks up wins and point differentials by playing a bunch of like scrubs like barely barely uh trip uh you know barely uh top division schools and then as soon as Grant showed up oh fuck oh no what's this oh he's not able to do his tactically it's like yeah sure he's lost a lot of his army but one of the big reasons he lost so much by then is that he invaded the north which was the stupidest and most pointless thing. what are you doing invading the north? your entire advantage is that you have mastery of your area, time is on your side uh, if you were able to maintain like an internal interior like lines of uh control, you can bleed them out, especially that early in the war, before uh sherman had broken through in the in the west, what are you doing? yeah, play for time, you're you're you had, they had guys. trying to persuade the British and the French and the Russians to uh to recognize the confederacy for uh and they've been getting places, it was a close-run thing, honestly it's the working class of England is maybe one of the most had more influence on the the victory of the the union than almost any other uh uh force outside of the United States certainly is that because the leadership of of UK and Napoleon Ird and the fucking sar were all in favor. of uh, i think the zar was uh uh was was not as but i know the france and England, but they were on board to recognize uh the confederacy, they wanted it, yeah, give us, give us the fucking uh, carve up, curve up the American continent, break up that superpower, you want that, why wouldn't you? um, And the other thing that you're not considering is even if it's looking bad, one, it still took them two years, so whatever recconing you're like, we have to do it now, didn't have to do it, they didn't have to do it, look how long they were able to hold out even after spending their shot in uh going north, they didn't, if they fought a defensive war, they probably could have lasted longer, because they still lasted pretty long, the idea that he had to go norther they would have like it would have collapsed, that's absurd, and then he fucked it up. Yeah, no, and then of course there's the smugness, just like that, was so terrible, that we should grow fond of it, shut up, you freak, sicco. Willich or seagle, willach, come on, come on, come on. uh theories on Bohemian grove, it's it's a weird uh fancy dress party for a pretentious rich dickheads and maybe they sacrifice people to molilic I don't know, I kind of feel like it's too on the nose to do it there, I feel like they do it elsewhere. I will, I will say that uh, just as a last word in here before i I wrap up that I will recommit that I will never kill, I would not kill baby Honkler, and now that gives me an idea for something which if I had photoshop abilities I would do, I would get uh, if I could get the footage at the very end of if anyone has seen come and see the soviet movie about the the nazi uh counter gorilla war. in belarus, pretty intense film, and it ends with this kid shooting uh, this this vengeful child sort of confronted with a picture of baby Hitler, and he can't, he finds that he can't kill the baby, you know, it's a classic kind of you, pre for plea for understanding and all that uh, and I just imagine you cut that in and you just have it, have the kid looking and it's just baby honler instead. like hankler with like a a diaper on, i think that'd be pretty funny. well, you don't even have to kill Hitler, if you can go back in time, presumably going back um, i mean just take Hitler and like take him to the uh, take them to the united states, give like uh go to their house. take the kid, take a take a boat to uh, the US and like drop him on an orphanage door, what's he gonna do, what's Hitler going to do if he's like grows up a like a a catholic orpanage like with babe rooth in Baltimore or something. I actually have read Miss lonely hearts Nathaniel uh Nathaniel West the guy who uh the guy who first had a character named Homer Simpson in the day of the locust? What's wrong with Christian Yelich? That's a good question. Maybe it's just a sign that no one should be doing this. that it's stupid and that they should stop playing baseball. I don't know, I so I don't have any hope for the brewers to win this year, but I don't know what, if you're if you're a fan of a team that has never had a championship in your life, right? like I'm a brewer fan, they uh went to the they went to the uh world series once when I was a weeby and they uh lost in seven games to the fucking cardinals. curse them eternally uh and you know that's really the only sport thing I have any kind of investment in, I don't really care about basketball, bucks are good, go for it, oh, maybe that's a good example, uh, or you're you know the Indians or something, or the mariners, my god, if you won this year, would you, would it count, would it feel, would it feel like anything? I kind of feels like it would be just such a massive acerix. that i wouldn't be able to invest myself, does that make sense? no astricts on championships, i don't know man, when it's a 60 game season with a bunch of weird uh gimcrackery in the in the playoffs, come on, come on, it would be a very mariner thing for them to do to finally win a world series in a in the covid season, yeah no, i think there's if you want to watch it for its for its soothing aesthetic'. uh attributes which i certainly favor all absolutely, but one, i don't think this is very good baseball, and two, it just feels drained of meaning, it feels like the meaning of it is to deny reality, it feels like every game is just a a thumb in the eye of of our consciousness of of what's happening around us, it's an attempt to just drown us in a fucking pail of honey rather than look around and see what the fuck is going on, and that's This is not normal. Uh, I thought Sean, Sean Dulittle said something really cool in a in his press conference when they were starting this up and they were already watching it, and he said, and and this was before the season started, and he said, sports are like a reward for a society, you know, like like, something, something as frivolous, as a fundamentally frivolous as a professional baseball league, that should be a reward for for a society creating a certain degree of... functionality, hey, now we can watch baseball, we do not, we have not reached that, we don't deserve it, and I don't mean that in a moral sense, I just mean that we do not, we cannot afford it, basically, we cannot afford the attention, we cannot afford the mystification of thinking that we live in a in the normal times, because it's killing people, it's literally killing people, and it's making it almost, it's making. that it'll be longer and harder to deal with this than anywhere else. god, I know it's cheap to say this, and I know it's it's it's cringe, and I know that it's bluepill uh, it's bluepill Hillary, resistance kafify shit, but you have to ad, just admire the breathtaking irony of the Trump administration spending its first year or so, first first two years, focused fully on... heightening the social contradictions around the issue of immigration, specifically, who gets to come into America? do Muslims get to come into the America? not on our watch, they're dangerous. do mexicans and uh other south south uh latin american immigrants get to come in? absolutely not, they're they're they're the killers, the killers, and now his term is ending and the American passport gets you into as many countries as like North Koreas, you literally we can't leave, we can't fucking leave. I mean, come on, Rod Silling wouldn't a fucking put that out, so we have to watch as other places figured out better, although seeing all those... knobs in Germany running around was kind of nice honestly, it felt good to know that they're out there, maybe not as many numbers is here, but they're out there, yeah, america, America love the carcereal state so much that they made the entire country out of the prison. I'm not snoring cocaine, thank you no much, I'm taking legal, legal CBD vapes. Germans are the largest ethnicity in America, it's true. Ever Rummaged, the host of American of age of Napoleon as a theory about the uh, the essential German soul being like warped, and I know that. that's that's that doesn't sound very materialist, but if you if you organize around the language, if you organizer around german, and you think about how weird German is, and how rich with untranslatable mass, multisyllabic concepts and the way that being able to think that way impacts the way that you uh, view the world. I don't know, there's a reason that you know, German idealism is a thing, and the pursuit of idealism in a material world drives. people and society's mad in different ways depending on the conditions, but it's inevitable. uh Adam was cool Adam, you know people can say he's live and it's like yeah people are fixed in time and place and but he's made, i think that he has adjusted to reality better than pretty much anybody in his social situation i can think of, i mean because the incentives run so far the other direction that uh it seeing anybody resist them is really uh awesome and knowing he's a fan of the show honestly is is childhood dream come true because i was not bullshitting when i said that that i knew him as a kid watching snl like i recognized his stuff uh and you know was a big fan of obviously loved all the will faral movies but you know his his shit is is still in my opinion the best the best stuff snl did in like the post maybe like pat since mike uh since micouna anyway. but yeah so uh yeah that was cool mc is cool i'd like to have them on again and yes shout out again to sylvester slone who if you haven't seen it his performance in the orange julia sketch it's heartbreaking it makes copland uh look like uh it makes copland look like over the top boom boom oh no sorry sorry uh it's it's copland, it's uh it the orange Julia Sketch makes copland look like stopper, my mom will shoot, there we go, that's better, that's the funniest stalone name, i simp, i simp, i thought jim downy was pretty much well uh, well established to be a conservative, i thought jim downy was like a republican, i thought that was pretty well, i thought i thought that was pretty well uh documented, i mean i don't know enough, maybe not, i think my favorite for last permitten, i think someone was asking my this is my last question, my favorite i think you could should leave sketch uh and that's very tough cuuse i think the're the the vast majority are really really good uh I think just like laughs per minute, the vanessa bear uh hog pig dick girl uh lunch scene is just so good, but I think for longer more broke ones uh, it might be hank if you're horny, it's really hard to beat hank with your horny, hot dog sketch is also very good, Keep naming them if I keep thinking, it's really good, I can't wait for a second season, friday night and I'm thinking that. we just might get together when we don't know who we are, this will be the end, now to sing a song of the decease, and i'm thinking that we just might away don't know who we are, now it's saturday. thinking that we just might somewhere that we are. and be who we are, i love you mom.
