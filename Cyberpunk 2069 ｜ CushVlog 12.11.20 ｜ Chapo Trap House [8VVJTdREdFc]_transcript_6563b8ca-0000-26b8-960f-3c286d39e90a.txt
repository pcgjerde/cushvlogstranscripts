 Ah, did it finally go? Did i finally go, I think I might have finally gone. Oh, I'm seeing critters. Fuck. Yeah, there we go, I'm very sorry to free up the critters, I know we all love the critters folks, they're delightful, they're friends, there they're gentle creatures of the forest deep, we all wish we could frolic with them daily. but sadly we must spend our days with much less agreeable mammals, namely parking human beings, his brains have been filled with poison, Oh no, I did pet a horse in the snow and I was canvassing for Bernie in New Hampshire, it was out in the country and there was a house that had a paddock next to it, and there was a horse out there, there was nobody home, but I got to pet the horse, and that was nice, they're fun, they got those big gigantic eyes. now horses are nice, show dudes, should thatts, oh the volume. is super low, huh? well, at this point there's nothing i can do about it, so i'm just accepting that you can hear it or not, and if you can't hear it, well maybe you weren't meant to hear it, maybe hearing it would be bad for you, maybe there are forbidden truths that you're not ready to absorb, and as a result, this, it's like the world spirit, awah herself is blocking the audio quality and making it so that you can't hear these these things that would break your mind and uh send you off into a spiral of self-destruction and destruction of others. uh, in fact you could say that the uh variable volume uh is is the thing that saved your life, so so be, be thankful, be thankful as you are for all things. I did finish how to with last episode was phenomenal, the whole thing is brilliant, and I watched some of his videos on video, and it's very interesting to see his like style change over time as he kind of refineds what he's doing, buse like the earlier stuff is much cruder in it's like uh, in its comedy and also in its overall uh uh like point of view, time is is a necessary ingredient for art, somebody says that uh, moralistic fables can be good like avatar. if the if the moral is good, i mean that's half of it, the other half is it has to be told well, and the thing i would say to anyone that says that avatar is in a good movie in any respect is that if you could tell me that you were sitting there watching those scenes where they're flying on the back of the dragon thing uh the big battle, i mean think of what combat and action scenes are like in current movies, big movies, michael Bay Christopher Nolan, all the Marvel shit, think of what those Zack Schneider, think about what those action scenes look like, big battle scenes, they are largely incomprehensible uh. pixelated explosions of uh, i can't sort it out, what am i supposed to do, they decontextualized, and that are edited into a total haphazard slog generally, i mean if you like Christopher Nolen movies, you don't really like the action scenes right, like you like the puzzle box stuff, you like the clever things, how many action scenes? Nolan's like uh repertoire of of you know great moments cinematically, maybe the hallway fight in inception, but that's not really about the action, that's about the that's about the specific like dimensions, although you know, even there it's not shot particularly interestingly or like emotionally, you watch the like the big klagmactic battle scene in avatar, he sets up spatial relationships so you know... where everything is, where the where the uh, the people are, where the ships are, then he has them engage in battle, and every shot build a little narrative within the battle, whereas modern action is kind of built around the premise of disorientation, and while you might say, that's good in its own way, one thing it doesn't do is build investment in it as a piece of narrative, it doesn't tell a story, a story, not the story, but a story within the story. Right, and Cameron's action tells stories within stories, so his moral, his simplistic Disney Moral is wetted to technical uh, uh, technical genius. Somebody who says, yeah, thank you, anyone, the reason somebody said uh, sort out your audio mate, and triggered me because British people, I am done with, I am done with hearing anything from British people, they are about to just blow themselves up and sink into the North Atlantic on purpose because they just are too fucking miserable to deal with one another, they had a total possibility, they had a chance to fucking be a functioning country, they had a guy who was standing there in front of them saying, hey you fucking pussy uh disgusting trolls, how about you shit quit being miserable for one second of your life and believe in each other just enough? to fucking press a button in a goddamn voting booth and they couldn't be asked to do it, instead they would rather fucking just pull a giant cork out of the the sink hole out of the fucking uh the drain and just let them swirl into the ocean good fucking ridens after after birthing this monstrosity after birthing global capitalism and then being left bered after your kid ran away ran across the... doesn't have to be this way and the miserable fucking bog bog monsters decided ah no he's not he's lying it can't be real it's a trap because i if everyone around here is like me and i am so awful and miserable and shitty and and pale and and and grotesque and and and nasty and and uh disconnected and anti-social well then none of us can ever get together on anything why not just go to pretending it's the blitz again getting national coh like basically what what what brexit was is is an attempt by the British people to regain a moment that they all think they actually cared about one another and that was World War II that was the that was the emergency that was the keep calm and carry on moment when they had meaning in life because they had an understanding of themselves that went beyond their individuality they were part of a fucking of a country that was under attack from evil and that was fighting it and found and and there's struggle and sacrifice in that context had a virtue and they want it again, that's why they're jacking off at the idea of all the food they won't be able to eat, how they're going to have to do victory gardens and stuff and ration potatoes because they need to get that back, because they can't imagine any other way to get it, even though Jeremy Corbin is standing there right there, hey, if you guys want to have like national sense of purpose and mission, we don't have to do austerity to ourselves massachistically, you fucking repressed victorian freaks, how about... "we create a actual polit a actual, we turn this country out, we we take it from being a business enterprise and turn it into a country, an actual like civic project." a a civic project of governance and a civic project of of um of improvement rather than just a civic project of of uh dower withstanding of of of pain, a dower endurement of of because because they can because that's conceivable to them, because national unity through austerity is conceivable, because in that case you're operating out of hate fear, you're operating out of fear, you're operating out of afraid of something being worse, yes huddling underneath the tube, waiting to get blown up, yes, cutting a bean into three pieces like in a fucking war uh lony tunes cartoon for dinner uh that's unpleasant, but it's better than the nazis taking over, it's better than a goop on your neck and and uh fucking concentration camps on the thems, uh, but here and now corben's uh not anti-austerity pledge for national purpose. that was appealing to the idea of love, the idea of getting doing something better, and they can't imagine that, because they don't love anybody including themselves and of course, it's not like we're much better than that, they're just further along in this process of alienating themselves from the world, because they started before we did, and there's fewer of them, which means that the it intensifies like the generational pathogens just multiply over time. and so they're just all so miserable that they can only operate off of they can only be they can only be socially uh they can they imagine that they can only be socially uh um compelled by a fear of punishment of some kind in the form of well all right austerity Britain sucks but it's better than becoming uh you know a completely polish uh denatured capital uh dissolved uh department of Europe which will be miserable in a different and worse way. those are horrors beyond imagining, whereas i can imagine what it would be like to have to to to have a victory garden, my grandpa talks about it and he talks about how everybody was happier back then, we're going to make it happen again, and they had the chance, they had the sign post, they said, no, thank you, we're too traumatized by our own. "we've been too defeated by victory, because all of this stems from the fact that these are the monsters who destroyed the world, these are the monsters who set out more than anyone, they were the most successful ones anyway, among the Europeans, the ones who set out to subdue the world and to turn it and to turn everything in it away from everything else and towards itself, they started it, their culture has been molded and and uh and completely driven around that central premise since the dawn of capitalism and now they find themselves a husk where they don't even have the the they have lost for many more years than us the dream of plenty that we were able to sustain because of the fantasy first of our western expansion and then the global uh bounty of the post war dominance that we enjoyed the the empire that we held before before the borders closed off and before the myth uh lost its potency or we had to turn back inward and try to find a way to deal with one another having no, having to developed no social bonds in like 40 years, having generated no social trust in 40 years, well it's been a lot longer for the brids, so you can't as with anything, you can't blame them, but I sure shit don't have to fucking listen to them, I sure shit don't have to listen to them condescending to me with their goddamn fancy accents and their dumb slang, calling me their mate, I'm not your fucking mate. and of course Americans can't get too cocky because we're right behind them, we are right behind them, it's just you know we have more, we have more uh loot to to burn through before we get to the Mexican standoff, but it'll be and it'll be very interesting to see how much self-inflicted damage will come from this, just because of the refusal to have any faith in each other. and maybe it couldn't have been any other way, maybe they're too far gone, maybe maybe corbin was like this thing that only could come into being, he could only be the guy, like he could only be the guy because he was never a real threat, and if you think about it, that is in technical terms what happened, because corbin was only nominated, was only put in as a name from leadership after uh after millaband aid shit, because he been around for a long time, he'd been a real troop. about all that new labor invading of irak shit, which you know he was against the entire time and watched his party do from the back bench, uh, hey, and he stuck around and he was, he was there you know to not to to to put... you know blair and brown in there, real good sport, let's give him a little shot, huh? little top, let's give him a little fun time, it was like a make a wish moment, it was like remember bat kid, is anybody old enough now to remember batkid, when that little like kid, by the way, is he dead, did that kid die or is he in remission? because honestly if he doesn't die that's kind of ridiculous what they did for a kid who is just like you know basically just in the hospital i mean fuck i went to the hospital i was a kid i went to the i had been through some fucking stuff, but anyway uh, it was the make a wish thing from the labor of front bench, and then what happened is is that oh shit, you know, the the loss and sort of shaking things loose enough that people were interested in a new thing, and as soon as, as soon as that became something that was on the menu, all these labor members, remember these are people who don't just vote in primaries, they are members, which means that their relationship to the party is much different than the relationship of American. liberals and leftists or whatever voters and the democratic party, and so he caught on, but he caught on in a context where he was only allowed to be an option because of the fundamentals uh hegemonic rule of the new labor uh leadership, and then the proof of that can be found that even when he won the the the the the spot, he was never able to actually have control of the party, as we now know, at every level he was explicitly sabotaged. by people and was not and either because he was too much of a softy or they didn't have enough leverage and that might if if it's if it's if it's leverage point then this was never going to work uh they did not purge the party they did not purge and get rid of all these time servers they didn't clear the augian stables of blarrs and once they didn't do that they were basically fucked now they might have lost anyway because of the way the entire you know media apparatus organized against them that might have been tough and Brexit was there to be the wedge on behalf of. um, but that inability to actually have your party operating on your behalf that meant he was never going to be able to mount a real challenge, and maybe that's because they knew a basic like basil level that even if you let him in, you'll take care of, and if that's the case, it's it, corbin was always just sort of this like last burnoff of xx and democratic vision, like he was the last gascious put of the last little pocket of like uh human uh feeling on the continent or on that island on that accused land like the last bit of human felt communal uh identity that transcended the personal it just that's being like burned out of all society by the drive train of capitalism and alienation and this was as like we near the final and total alienation of Britain there's and then final perhaps destruction literal dis government due to a nodeal brexit a suicidal act of the end of the this is the DMT, the corbin was the DMT basically, the last spiritual sign of the collective humanity of Britain before the death rattle kicked it, now of course that means we are on that trajectory, and maybe Bernie was that with us, but Maybe we have a few more, maybe there's a few more uh, maybe there's a few more boxes to open, maybe a few more cats are alive than we currently think, no way knowing, but you can see the trajectory, you certainly can see the trajectory, and uh, I do wonder what the Brits are going to do, buse this looks like it's going to be something in the middle of COVID, I mean my god, this thing was supposed to be a disaster to do it in the middle of COVID, my god, and uh, I will say uh, also that I know there was a left case for Brexit, I know that Corbin was a Brexiter, and well he should have been, like if Brexit hadn't happened and Corbin had been been able to become prime minister of a left-wing labor government, he probably would have pursued some sort of brexit from the left and it would have been a good idea, and so there's a critique of of Corbin that he did not just embrace a left brexit from the beginning, and the problem is that is that if you do that, you do lose your right flight completely, like they flee to uh to the liv dens and make it impossible you for for you probably to govern, because they just got out of a coalition with the with the fucking tories, they would go back into one in a heartbeat by literally joining them, if they could like get into positions of power within the party, which they certainly would, because they're they were. they'd be holding the whip hand there um and you know you could argue it wouldn't have mattered they would have been able to sweep them in uh they would have been able to combine like the working class tory voter pool and the entire work class uh uh labor voting pool and the Scots bring the Scots back from the SNP and they would have fucking swamped them uh, but it was a real concern, and that's because at the nexus of liberals and leftist at the nexus of right and left uh labor members, on the issue of Brexit, was how far can we go in letting this happen without being irresponsible? because there was this understanding that... Brexit would be bad materially for the people who live in Britain, that it would not, it would, it's not something to be reckless about, and the left position was, don't let them fucking intimidate you, don't let them try to spook you with this, like at the end of the day you're too big of an economy for them to just completely let fuck up and like uh, these politics can be finessed uh by not finessing them, and there is that, there was that whisper in the ear that like labor had to stay away from uh pushing over the cook machine. to to Brexit out of like a general need to preserve you know basic integrity of the British economic system and it was always theoretical buse what was going to happen in Brexit is unknown and everybody had a personally emotionally invested subconscious bias on how much to take it seriously like the more of a live you were, the more seriously you took the like objective. economic argument about what would happen if Brexit was uh went through, the more you wanted to just say fuck you to this whole brexit bullshit but and go around it and just embrace a left brexit even though that meant in practice doing a a a a tory brexit because that's the that's the thing is that you're not you're probably going to be doing a tory brexit then uh because they're the ones who initiated it and that's where the the uh that's where the center of gravity of support for Brexit was was in the late was in the conservative party and that and that it broke against demographic currents that you need to keep together uh as the left-wing party and you don't want to fracture them so it was a live question but it was invested with which uh your your material preferences like that was guiding you more than you even knew when you were deciding how seriously to take the threat of Brexit to the economy and to the livelihood of people in Britain and I guess we're going to find we're going to find out how much of it was uh was propaganda and how much of it was real. yeah, that's the thing is that uh, is that the even though labor could have gotten a huge percentage of voters with a with a left brexit position and they would have eaten into some of the tory working class. vote, brand loyalty is such, traditional voting patterns and like social bonds are such, racial understanding and things like that are such that you wouldn't get all of them or maybe even most of them, you might only get a small fraction, meanwhile everybody who already votes Libdem, which is not insubstantial, plus what, what percentage of the labor vote would would have voted for the lib dems in that situation? It's got to be at least 25%, right? And if it's 25%, that would almost guarantee a coalition between like there was uh with Cameron and uh, Nick Lund or whatever the fuck is Jeb Lund, who the fuck was his name? Nick kleg, that's it, sounds like a fucking horse taking a shit, nick klegg, uh, and I'll just do it again, so it was a tougher spot than just saying fuck it, we'll be legends and and be left. brexiter uh, but the thing that made it so slippery is that it all hinged on a premise that couldn't be confirmed, like what is Brexit really? is it a boogie man or is it a dis is it an apocalypse? i mean it's probably not going to be either, but it's going to be closer to the one than to the other. we might actually find out. Michael Tracy watches the streams, really? How, how do you know? Are you Michael Tracy? Oh, he nick me bleeding my, he nicked it mate, it's bloody, it's nick mate, he nick it, think people are say, honestly though, people say um, like, oh, the brits are going to lose lose the United Kingdom, those idiots, think about it this way, though, so presumably, if you did get some sort of complete. solution of the United Kingdom, farring in the context of just complete economic collapse, I mean, a managed transition, the velvet revolution type thing. Who would be mad? Obviously the Scots would not be mad. the welsh wouldn't be mad, some of the uh northern irish would be mad, but it wouldn't be the UK's problem anymore, that would be the Irish's problem. uh, good luck with that dublin, which by the way is one reason that I really don't think that the're that that excited about the prospect uh of of reunification in the halls of power in the republic, because all of a sudden you would have to deal with one integrating a uh the uh most economically depressed part of Ireland into your economy, which is much smaller in general than Britain's is, and deal with this now active, restive, not quite majority anymore, but like 50% of the population, and you might say, okay, you know, maybe only a third of them are still really uh, you know, poker up the ass unionists, but that's still enough to mean, you're going to get some version of the troubles pop up again, with the reverse, with the powers revers. but and uh you know it would i don't think it would necessarily be anywhere near as intense as the last one, but is it a really headache you want when everything is basically the same, the main difference is the colors of the fucking post boxes, but again it breaks it comes in, that changes the calculus, and then what about the english is what i say, what about the english? won't they be sad that they lost their empire? no, they'll be relieved, they get to be England, being being british only had meaning when it felt. like it was part of a project of greatness, of expansion, of at least prestige, but in like crisis uh, EU conditions, England essentially had a nervous breakd because remember, England is the only part of the UK that voted for leave, and it's where labor lost was in England, because they essentially pulled the pin on the United Kingdom themselves, because this these these... vestages, these appendages, those these pissed off scottish people who want to like act like they're not us, like they didn't do the fucking uh, you know, they didn't do uh the suppression of the seapoy rebellion or whatever that hell, because oh we oppress them or something or these dumb fucking Walesmen with their dumb fake language getting oppressed when you call them a sheep fucker and these goddamn mix whining over in England even even Ireland even though they were blowing us up and our own pubs only a few years ago all we got to hear is bitch bitch bitch it's what's the point of this? why don't just be England again, get quiet, feel, just be alone with our thoughts as good English people and not have to worry about these fucking uh, yapping assholes, so yeah, I'd say everybody would be happy with a breakup, except for the olster Scots of course, they're going to be very mad, Katie bar the door. Yeah, does, do any UK or Irish people in the chat want to want to pop up with some like uh, more informed ideas of what that would look like, like if there was a reunification, because I could totally see it, cuz you would not, if if they voted, do we due to this new situation with the EU, do we do with uh and the border being reestablished, breaking the good friday agreement and like essentially ripping up the document that had prevented war from breaking out for the past. 25 years now 30 years uh 25 um, if that's going to be the new order, it would make more economic sense, it would be make better sense for my family to rejoin the republic. you got basically all the all the catholics are going to say that, and at this point that's what 45, almost 50% they're neariing parody because they outbreed the protestant, but then among uh the but then among the protestants, among younger people who didn't grow up in the fucking ferness of the uh of the troubles uh the desire to you know have a functioning economy uh and and uh ease of ease of movement and stuff like that will be more than whatever vestigual relationship they had to the union leaving only sort of the most unreconstructed paisliite. which so that's what 25% of the population, what would they do, like obviously the armalites are coming out again, they're not going to just take that lion down, but like how far do they go, is it is, is it like tea party shit, they just marsh around with ars, like and then just do random like uh uh uh violence or do they do they like go to go to war, but the thing is they're mostly drug gangs now, like like all those all the unionist. uh paramilitaries, they're still around, but they are, they're completely dedicated since, I mean, you know, it's like they they they they demobilized the the war with the IRA because they they had essentially uh agreed to sublimate their conflict into politics, so they they did the but the so they didn't really need to exist anymore, the Ira needed to exist because they were the loser in in the sense that they didn't kick the brits out, the brits are still there, so they did not get their ultimate aim, so they had to keep the weapons, they had to keep the organization going, the paramilitaries had no reason to exist except for the fact that they were already by that point selling a shit load of fucking drugs and making a shit load of money, which is way better than around the pub with a fucking doll check in your pocket in one of these fucking housing estates, so they fucking are right now the the people who sell heroin in northern Ireland, if they changed the color of the mail boxes, do they give a shit enough to give up that life? again, I don't know, what do people think? What's up with Armenia and Azerbaijan? Uh, well, uh, a pretty astounding uh, monstrous, monstrous uh, it's more war crimes from Turkey, it's more war crimes from our from our NATO ally, which we look the other way while they ethnically cleansed northern Syria, and now they're doing it in Nagorno uh, with the azires, it's and there uh, essentially. "I got to believe that it's some sort of deal with Russia. I'm assuming that on some other point in the geopolitical map, and maybe Libya would be a place, uh, Putin is like has an interest greater than his strategic interest in Armenia, which Erdogan was able to uh, to arbitrage by saying, hey, I will give you this because it doesn't matter as much to me as Armenia does, and so Putin says " Sure, because by his calculus, he's losing less than he's getting, but by Erdogan's point of view, whatever he's losing, whether it's in Libya or with the shale oil they're trying to drill off of Cyprus, he is more much more interested in getting back some of that territory from Armenia, and so the exchange happened, the stately quadriel continued, the dirty game of diplomacy at another round, and it's my... It's it's hideous, it's poor buying, they're chopping off old men's heads and putting it on fucking tiktok, I don't what what what much else to say about it, I mean the fact that it's not on the news and the way that Syrian civil war is tells you a lot if you didn't already know, but you should probably know by now, oh yes, yeah. this is the series, the azies like they would do anything cuz Armenia is a regional all, armenia is a regional allie to Russia, which is right there, you think are Azerbaijan is going to pick a fucking fight at that that close to Russia without backup, guaranteed back up from Turkey which was immediately supplied, that's the context that the whole thing takes place in, you can't remove that and act like oh it's not turkey, fuck off cuz Azerbaijan doesn't choose, doesn't get to choose... whether or not to go into uh naragon, erdogan gets to choose, therefore it's because of Turkey, tell me how I'm wrong, now you might have a situation where somebody overextends themselves and you have to go in, but that's not what happened here, that's sure shit not what happened here, is a calculated escalation to see what they could get, and they got Norgoro because Putin had other interests that were greater. Where is a caraboc? I have no idea. I really don't know much about it. Just the broad strokes. critical support for the arminians for. I mean, I think that's a yeah, buse some of these get tough, you know, if you want to do the campus thing of.... like okay, on the anti-imperial side, but this one's a pretty easy one, especially when you see what uh, what they're doing in the places that they've conquered, like they're doing ethnic cleansing, they're they're pulling off the like the Armenian riding off of uh churches to claim that they're actually old mosks for they were mosks first so they can do the hegia sofia thing and uh chopping people's heads off and so anyway does anyone have an idea how how how what kind of action would you give on the uh the udf show up like gonna do bombs again they going to like do or just like maybe like shoot up a ship shop or you're going to see like a coordinated uprising. my gut tells me a couple of showpiece uh uh old school carbombs like the one they did in uh dublin, some people don't know this, but the the deadliest uh bombing of the troubles did not happen in northern Ireland or in England, it happened in Dublin when the UVF took a fucking truck down in the middle of the the town, middle of like McConnell street, O'connel street. and detonated it without calling in a warning beforehand, which the ira did as standard operating procedure. once again, you know, you can always say, another man's terrorist is a guy streater fighter, but sometimes you can tell who the good guys and bad guys are in these things, broadly speaking, they just drove the thing in there and let it blow up and kill as many people as possible. they do a more couple of those for sure, but i don't think they do much more than that, buse, well for what? at this point, none of this stuff has any, i don't know. what to say, i have no idea. the thing you have to remember is that the the the current situation is such that like the the the remaining structure of these paramilitaries are sustained by their relationships with the political structure, both at uh stormont in the power sharing government, which until recently replaced uh rule from westminster, although I think it's been suspended for years now, which is another thing that's going to contribute and is contributing to a likely - crisis around Brexit, they literally haven't had home rule for like two years now, since before Brexit, and then of course with the British government, which has coordinated with them the whole time, and used them as the cats paw for extra legal assassinations and murders and bombings all, it was essentially uh, it was essentially cheltic gladio, it was it was a nato member using local uh criminal fascist elements to carry on a the war against the left and they would essentially be cut off in this situation because I don't think the English are going to care enough to like you know take e-boats full of uh full of enfield rifles to to the ports of northern Ireland so that they can keep these guys fighting the Irish bause they don't care the English don't care they haven't cared for years uh so without that back. and the fact that they're basically a bunch of dumb ass uh old smack dealers, i don't think they'd have a lot in them. there would be an exodus, that's the big thing, like a lot of the most hardcore guys would just leave, they'd go to England, although it'd be funny if the the brexit made it harder for them to get uh to get citizenship, ah, I've uh, I've always been a, I've always been a student of the trouble specifically, I had a college class about nationalism and and uh, and it was all through the prism of of uh, the Northern Irish question, so. It was like one of the first like historical and political puzzles I ever encountered in uh college, so and I've been there, I've been to Ireland a number of times and it's got a great and it's also you know as you learn more about it, it's got a great revolutionary tradition, I mean you got so many different uh movements and and uh formations of of resistance and leaders, you got like the white boys and... fucking uh uh and um and the uh uh fucking monster rallys with Danielle and Charles Stewart Parnel Roger Casement then the for the easter rising wolf Tone blowing his fucking jaw off to try to avoid capture by the English. at the rising of the moon, at the rising of the moon, the ris of the boys for freedom that rise and the moon, and then you of course you've got one of the goats, one of the early, one of the great figures of uh of the early communist uh labor movement, james connoly, who was a kind of an Irish Lincoln in that any system where any world where uh the... post war republic doesn't descend into stagnant uh uh fucking catholic quasi feudal theocracy james connoly does not uh get murked because there was nobody to follow in his footsteps and even though the citizens army that he'd founded did most of the heavy lifting during the easter rising, the the uh the ira that came later it just had a much more deluted labor uh uh prerogative and by the end of the war it all got kind of stamped out of it and all you got left is fucking the fucking blue shirts - man Michael Collins uh the big fella, I mean a certified pimp uh, one one of your great uh insurgency uh geniuses, you know, a guy who you want to fight a uh asymmetrical war, which uh cats off to them because they kind of had to made it up as they went along, but um he fucked he fucked the dog during the negotiations with Churchill. "I think at the end of the day he just fell for a bluff, um, I think they could have pushed it farther, because I don't think that churchill knew is they, Churchill didn't know how bad they really will were off, uh, but the thing is is that I don't think Collins knew how little the English at the end of the day really cared, like they cared, because you know they had that big presence, especially in allster." like that was the prestige of the empire and all that, but I mean at the end of the day I think you're like he just didn't have the the confidence, so like he looked, he looked churchill in the eyes and he just he blinked first, and that's usually how these things end up going, it's like a lot of these historic decisions, the the friction ends up depending on how the turn of a coin is between individuals, uh, individual decisions and moments or you, the collection of those rebounding on top of one. another, but one way or another, he went home with an unviable document, which of course, the frustrating thing is is that it's what they ended up settling for anyway, none of it was, none of the fighting was meant anything, but nobody knew that at the time, because like so many things were bound up, you know, like it was the left-wing position to reject the reject the treaty, but at the same time the specific question ended up being beside the point, and the fact that that's what the civil war ended up being, I think the fact that the civil war in Ireland ended up being about what uh, a formal question that ended up meaning nothing in the long run, ended up ensuring that their post war politics were going to be what they ended up being, literally non-ideological contests between the remaining sides of that war, like after the civil war in the United States that held for a little bit, it was just regional, the southerners are. Republicans, but the the fact that the war had been about some enduring question of you, means of production, for example, and or methods of production, like political economy questions, that inflected those those divisions and then the Irish civil war ended up being about an abstract principle of whether or not we sign this treaty and we we have this arrangement with Britain, and yes you can say things flowed from it, but that was the inciting thing. the way the civil war was around slavery, and it meant that in the aftermath of the war, as the necessity of the question receited from view, all that's left is just the echo of the sides you were on, and you can't say, well, and and and well, I understand why left-wing forces resisted the treaty, look at the remnant of the prost treaty, of the anti-Treaty side, it was the fucking... blue shirts, it was the closest thing that Ireland had to a fascism, it was the energy of that working class movement fatally fused to nationalism, because the fight had been over a national question, and so they turned into these freaky little uh catholic integralist goossteppers who went to fucking Spain to fight for Franko. Those were the only significant force of foreign volunteers the franco got other than you hired Morockan mercenaries was and and you now uh enlistted men from Italy and Germany uh who claimed to be volunteers uh were these fucking mick dick heads who came over there nobody knew what to do with them and they ended up getting shot up in a friendly fire incident and then sent home. that's my nationalism is bad folks, that's why it has it has to be dealt with, but it should never be organized as a princip an emotional or... like conceptual principle to organize around, it is an obstacle, that means that can't doesn't mean you can ignore it, it has to always be engaged with, but not on terms of friendliness, as an enemy, engaged as an enemy. and of course you can say that you know that the that the national question is different in a colonial context like Ireland was and it is different but it still colors the emergence of like the political struggle to come from the the the class conflict and it if it's not uh neutralized it will take over it will it will wipe out everything else capital it will fuse itself with capital again. like English capital will just change the the flag of convenience to the tricolor to the red green and uh green, white and orange, and then come in and keep robbing your fucking blind, and that's what happened, and then they had the class of priests to keep everybody nice and docil, keep all everybody uh, just cow eyed and indolid, like the worst, the worst uh parody of what 19th century, nothing said about what catholic democracy would look like, isn't that funny? like like the know nothing said we can't let the catholics into this country and we can't let them vote because they will turn our country into a priest plagued uh medieval uh bog, we will all be in the thrall of of cardinals and land owners or and and thrown into like a druidic superstitious uh age of darkness and and the Irish, once they kicked out the British, made that literal thing, and it's because the working class had been destroyed, because the working class energies emerging from the class conflict that drove the national conflict were spent and wasted in this feudal national crosade. James Larkan, uh, BTfo, sadly, but the reason the know nothings were wrong is that. they weren't coming into some like traumatized post-colonial situation, they were being assimilated into a into a capitalistic machinery of alienation which prevents the exact kind of priest bespoken medieval superstitious meastma that the catholics recreated in ireland, like that's part of like America's vastness and America's polyglad nature is one of the machineries that demystified Europe, pulled us all, it pulled Europe through like through through a mesh screen and brought it out the other side like uh like Gerld Jeral Ford Henry Ford used to hold uh pagents at his factories because he employed a lot of immigrants and he wanted to make sure that they all became good Americans so he would pay he had he had them all take on his dime english classes so and and uh eticat classes and like uh civics lessons and then they would have graduation ceremonies. where they would appear on stage, their families were in the audience, they would appear on stage in the native garb of wherever they came from, they would go up a uh upstairs to a uh on the top of a slide, and at the base of a slide was a big melt pot and it said melting pot on it, and they would come down the slide, they would emerge from behind the big cut out pot wearing a suit, and then they would all stand there in the suits and get and they would be clap, like it was ritual of induction into America, and the thing about that is that's basically what America did, that patient is is an expression of the the the way that that the alienated subject of American capitalism is a culturated within one or two within a few generations of coming to America into a social relationship that me that is essentially secular, that didn't happen in Ireland, I never got the industrial. they went right from feudalism to uh to neoliberalism, neoliberal capitalism, they miss the industrial development stage completely, which is why now they have the economy of a uh caribbean tax haven, the economic base of ireland is the same as like fucking Araba or or um the came, it's laundering money. Ireland does have an Empire, what do you call the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, oh, I guess that's more Scotland, I would argue that the mic, the Irish Catholic is the brain of the... impact like at what level are they you know uh affecting the rule the the the exercise of political and cultural power and i would say that you know most of the we we are mostly peasant refuse from one place or another the people someone else didn't want either because we were excess mouths from the from Europe from the European agricultural economy or from Africa. if we were defeated uh tribal enemies were sold away sold as uh you know uh to in return for for for produce from those very agricultural lands we are the refuse and then and then we sort along geographic lines and then we reproduce it and like some people go and fill the interior some people hung the coasts and the people the coast usually because of when they got there like all the good land closest to uh the early settlements was taken by the time the Irish really started showing up uh and uh and by the time the west was fully opened to like a genuine expansion beyond just like the reach of the uh of the appelations like when when the west was like lake Michigan that was the west and the west opened up completely by that point uh it was others uh uh by that point the Irish has have fixed themselves so deeply into the places they stuck, those east northeastern cities that that was where subsequent generations came because that's where they knew they could get a community, they that's where they knew they could operate, that's where they had some sorts of familiarity, that's where they could, because they didn't have anything, they couldn't come come come to America, slap down five shillings and buy a Kanastoga wagon and go claim land in the west, like the way that a lot of uh like... and then later german immigrants could do, I saved up all of my my uh my my grape harvest this year and I got three big double eagles with the with the the king of Bavaria's face on them and now I'm going to go to America and I'm going to buy a fucking hogs head of nails and roll it across uh state lines and sell it for a profit and whatever two nickels to rub together the Irish were just stacked like courwood and dumped onto the fucking shores of America they clung to the fucking coast which means they were there. to fill in those civil society roles like that that needed to be filled as as the the cities became more um uh more socially complex police officers, local politicians uh uh figures of both of uh public service and administration, someone had to do those jobs and they were there to do them, and they were the first PMC. first professional managerial class were the Irish immigrants who filled the the fire stations and police stations of uh of the eastern cities that became the center places of American like cultural production, even as we were producing capital elsewhere and we were spreading out across the country uh it was all being directed east for that's being equalized and like the political story of the last 40 years is the political story of that being equalized, but it started and stayed there and so... the Irish, they're deep in there, they're like, they're like a brain stemmy and they have they everything is kind of filtered through them, and then you got you, of course the American a Ashkanazi Jews fit a very similar role, and a higher level of the PMC because of their later appearance and their relative uh uh diversity of income, because like Jews of all economic stripe moved to the United States, all number of... used to rub together move to the United States uh whereas only the poorest Irish uh except for the one you were literally to pour to afford the ticket came to the United States at least they came in uh the the much larger percentages of them guys like you got all of the like if there's if there's a pagram and there's a huge push or there's a huge conscription. effort in the z's army, you got all those jews, or you got like a stretch, you got a section of all of them, you got the vast majority of of the of the immigrants from Ireland of the 19th century were of the lowest material circumstance, which means they came to the city and they had to get a job quick. and that's one of the reasons that we care so much about all that bullshit and and how the Ira was able to largely fund a a what 30 year war with the crown through donations from a plastic patty sitting around bars in Boston in Chicago. I love that Steve King who is a reactionary shithead and like in every in every in every way you were like typical from marble um. Olster protestant, you know, like just a rambrad reactionary psycho who fetishizes uh, a hierarchy and state violence, but because uh, he grew up around a bunch of wheepy mix, he says, yeah, these socialist uh, the these guys trying to overthrow like uh, the British control of Ireland so that they can institute a uh a a uh marxist communist government. I'm going to funnel thou millions of dollars to them by having like uh by having trying to think of an irish guy Gabriel burn at a uh at a potato eating contest potato eating contest oh they denied the the cracking got denied oh no oh wow the thing that we all knew was gonna happen happened damn. Well, hearing that, damn it, oh, I can't do it, I was gonna do it, all right, you'll sing it instead, I don't think you can get in trouble for singing something, I was gonna play it, but Twitch has gotten psycho about uh, about a dcc sees decist thing, so I can't play it, but apropo of uh Trumpy getting uh murked and um, what we've been talking about, uh, let me just sing, the catt lax stand by the house, and the yanks they were within, and the tanker boys with his advice to them were not sinned, and they came and shook as we had a look in the room where the dead man lay, and big jim dwyer his last ship of the show. reborn man of the usa, oh another good one was ribbonism, they used to wear ribbons and then go and like uh cave in the heads of landlords, there's this movie called black 47 that's on Netflix and it's really funny because it's like in one respect you can see why someone could say it's terrible and hated but I kind of respect it conceptually it's a drama of the uh of the Irish potato fammon and the story is essentially a it's the whole thing is designed to be like a school. cool child lesson in all the terrible things the English did, it was like sitting down a baby, it's like sitting the kid down and being like, hey, do you want to know about the Irish potato fam and I could explain it to you, I could write it down, but I could just make you sit and watch this for 90 minutes and then after having watched it, you will get it, and that means that it's sort of comical how on the knows it is, like every single facet of like English uh, colonial rule. in uh Ireland during the famin is total is all happens, like everybody, it all occurs every element of it, like the fact that they were a net exporter of uh food the whole time, because the vast lands of the were being held by the absenty landlords to produce food for export, and that uh you know that there was transportation for minor crimes to Australia, there are massive evictions from lands where uh the like people who weren't dying were living because landlords were wanted to turn um that it was more profitable during that period when there was low agricultural prices, it was more profitable to turn uh farmland into grazing land for sheep, so you didn't need tenants, you could turn that land into pasture, so they just kick them off, like all these things are in there, and and all those things is create this story of just unrelenting, hilariously miserable uh horror for this family, like this guy comes back, this Irish guy, the midst of the of the uh famin comes home to his family, they benefit from he he's deserted from the from the army in Afghanistan, his family's dead. had somebody gets murdered by a by a land a agent of the landlord is trying to evict them uh and then he just goes like he goes psycho mode he decides to just be a terminator of uh english colonialism he just starts taking everybody responsible for every element of misery in Ireland up to and then finally culminating in the English land owner uh is he fucking merks. and it's not good in the sense that it is not very subtle, it's not very uh hard to predict, the characters are very thin, but it's ability to just embody literally an entire sort of uh historical truth and just pack it all into one thing like a just a big gumball that you can show on for a while and like you get something i was like damn this has i i mean I don't know, like is this value purely didactic or is there something uh impressively artistic about it, I don't know, or maybe the whole thing is actually a uh, a parody, like it's like there's a lot of people who theorized that Titus Andronicus was Shakespeare's parody of Jakobian uh bloody Jacob revenge theater, like the the blockbuster cinema of the time where it was all just people murdering each other, and that was his satire of it, this is like a satire of the Irish uh cat. lot of whoa, you know, all the songs that you're supposed to sing about how the English came and burn my land and I could need a turn up, oh, I, the fields of atherry, where once I watch the slee birds fly, uh, so and it could just also just operate as a funny, funny parody, either way, it's it's... If nothing else you learn something. All right, I'm out of here guys, bye-bye.
