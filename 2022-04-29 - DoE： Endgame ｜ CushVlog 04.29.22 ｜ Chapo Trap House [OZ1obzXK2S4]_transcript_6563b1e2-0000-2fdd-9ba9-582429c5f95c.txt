 It's a pretty good crowd for a saturday and the manager gives me a smile cuz he knows that it's me they've been coming to see to forget about life for a while down at the bar is a friend of mine gets me by my drinks for free says you know I could be a movie star. all right, fuck, it's a pretty good crowd for a saturday, and the manager gives me a smile, buse he knows that it's me they've been coming to see, to forget about life for a while, john is a real estate novelist, he never had time for a wife, and he's talking to Davy still in the navy and probably will be for life, and the piano sounds like a carnival and the microphone smells like a beer, they sit at the bar and bread in my jar and say man, what are you doing here? hey say sing us the song, you're the piano man, sing us the song tonight, we're all in the mood for a melody, and you've got us feeling all right, hello folks, so we're all at the end here, wrapping it up, bow on it, uh, this is the end of our very long at this point cuuse I had to take a break for tour. uh breakdown of dawn of everything by grab grow, rip, we'll talk, i'm next week uh, i might do a stream, it will be earlier in the week because i'm going to be out of town uh later, but i'll probably just hang out, not going to do a book, i will probably announce the book that we're going to do next week and then maybe give a couple weeks uh before we start it uh right now i'm leaning towards uh leo panic's book, but uh, we'll see, the making of global capitalism, because I feel like there's something sort of nice about tying the bows together, if we're going to start with a book that's like, okay, how did like regimes of power emerge to now and on, okay, how is, how do we get to the point where regimes of power are alienated completely out of human hands, which is what? is uh as first a tool of a ruling class, but eventually uh a self-aware structure of power uh and will frankly that overals all human will and subordinates it to its purpose, that's what i think capitalism is at the end of the day, at the end of the day folks, that's what it is, it is the technological alienation of the drive to dominate that animates class society. uh focal point uh uh pivoted away from human uh will and intention and into a fully alienated uh algorithm of profit extraction and so we start with how it started now we got well well it would make sense to now talk about uh how that got out of our hands because if what grabgrow are describing here or trying to uh is the conditions that lead to the emergence of regimes of power that are human-based that have technology in them, that are technological, but are still determined by uh human will. uh, that is the beginning of a process that inevitably, i would argue, once it starts somewhere, once the first tumor pops into existence, it will inevitably uh overall the entire world. and one and as it does so, as regimes of power dominate the world, the destruction of the environment, the don't even not necessarily destruction, but disruption of the ecological balance that allowed that power regime of power to come into being, creates a destabilizing effect that over time destroys these structures, but because there is no challenge to the ruling class, it just reconstitutes itself with new uh uh new cultural language, new technology to reassert its authority. but it gets more challenging over time because the exploited become more capable of resistance, because at first they don't resist, they escape, like they talk in this book a lot about how human freedom was sustained by the ability, the freedom first of all to leave, and that freedom made it meant to took a long time for power to assert itself over every citizen. and make leaving impossible and requiring then resistance, and the worse it gets, the more resistance there is, and the ecological conditions that sustain power are always deteriorating and destabilizing over time, so new technologies have to be forged to make that power more efficiently distributed, uh, laminate the coersive and consensus seeking or um, the... carred and stick of society into one machine that can be operated at the push of a button, because the thing that undermines class rule at the end of the day is, yes you have a class interest, but it is not pursued by everyone within the class in the same way, it is pursued individually by members of a ruling class, which means that they might drive push the thing in one direction over time, but they they don't have fine motor control. in times of crisis, so they end up fumbling the bag, they end up getting deluted and destroying themselves, and this is what happens to your uh, your kings and your landed aristocrats, the the aristocracy of the sword, as the uh, as the emergent bourgeois who are closer to the new technologies of state and control, to exercise them more efficiently and take power away from the old landed elites, they get bought off, but their power is taken from them, and now the bourgeois power has been taken not by the working class as marx imagined it would, but by the very machines that they used to take power, and to me this is why, well there's a lot of great stuff in this book, and it's really really useful in my mind to understand. like human capacity, human social capacity as an abstract concept, it's a failure at trying to convince me that there's uh anything in those old ways of being that tells me how to avoid total annihilation of humanity by the machines it's created, because it does not have anything to say about those machines, it has nothing to say about the the role the technology and ecology play in pushing us into narrow and narrower and narrower shoots where we are forced to destroy one another and greater and greater displays of violence in order to maintain alienated class structures, because they want to make us believe that once these machines get in place, once sovereignty is wetted to uh charismatic. politics and is wetted to administration through the application of technologies such as agriculture, that they obliterate that world and they make a new one that we have all been living in ever since. and now we're at the end state of it, and it's not an end because there's necessarily going to be an apocalypse and end of humanity, that's what we dream of and seek and hope because it means we don't miss anything, we don't miss some sort of you know efforescence of humanity. all we miss is like more misery, oh great, fantastic, i'll get raptured up now, thank you, please, but just to case where our rulers change to the machines, and that there is no more subject, there is no more human subject that there used to be, because as it was as it was redefined by the emergent state structures. It is now being redefined by this stateless, globalized, universal architecture of symbols delivered electronically that have turned us into different beings again, now that doesn't mean that from these beings we can't build something else, but it will be in the rubble, it will be outside of this teleology of humanity, because it is a teleology and that's the big thing that's wrong with what grab grower, they'... and want to talk around and want to imagine alternatives to that could have existed. one time, yes, that's not necessarily teleological, and they do a good job undermining the notion that it is, but in the cone of civilization that extends until it includes everybody, there is an embedded teleology, and we're living in it, baby, so the the end of this, the the conclusion of this book is honestly pretty, it's a pretty damp squib, because the one thing they've been talking around the whole book well how do we get stuck with civilization? if there is all this possibility, if we're always have this, and we live for so long in possibility, how the hell did we let this happen? and they finally get to gesture towards it, and i got to say it is very unpersuasive, it's very uninteresting, they basically uh say, well uh, regimes of domination emerged out of uh regimes of care, because eventually the function of caring for those who are vulnerable, which they'... say uh early uh social orders socialized literally the the care of those who couldn't be cared for by their own families under the under the auspices of the monarch usually or like the chief or whatever and that that was originally bringing someone into a family but over time it became essentially a role of uh slavery and domination and it's like dude psychologically that's probably very true like that that is that is the story of the intimate. uh social transformation, the psychic transformation that turns someone who at one time saw everybody under their umbrella of of of of social life in their this definition of like humanity, full humanity uh that I could imagine someone beneath me, and the way they say it, the way they imagine it is, if runaways and uh and uh the disableds and the the catastrophically widowed are... thrown out of uh the the the small nodes of self-sufficient and self-sustaining and mobile, this is key, social order that i used to be a part of, i can still find sucker under the auspices of you know the uh the ritually affirmed embodiment of the community, which is what you know your headman, your chief, whatever is, but that relationship. can move from one of a intimate you know family to under, i would argue, conditions of scarcity and trauma into one of domination, where i don't see you anymore as a family member, i see you now as a burden, and it's like once, that's a great description, dude, but guess what, you're forgetting what you're what you're intentionally avoiding, what, what would have caused that change is an environmental shift. "the conditions for life would have changed, they just imagine it changing over time, just like a vibe shift, as if everything doesn't have a fucking cause, I would say that the better, more expansive way to to explain this, and the thing that would have honestly made this book really compelling and fully developed, but they couldn't go with because it would have gone against their their allergy to determinism." and materialism more broadly, which is that hey, they fucking uh had this breach in their understanding of care, because the conditions that sustained life in an equilibrium were no longer available, and they had to change them, and that means that eventually civilization will emerge, just like... modern subject eventually will get cancer if it lives long enough, not, you can't say, oh, you're inevitably going to get cancer, when you're 24, or on a day that a tumor is going to emerge, but you could say on a long, given the fact that you have a basically endless timeline here, because you have a relative equilibrium between humanity and the biome, something is going to pop up, a tumor is going to fucking pop up because of trauma, because of social carcinogens accumulating. And that's I think a full telling that then we can use to understand where we are now, but their their ideological priers, their anarchism makes them incapable of seeing it, they're literally incapable of seeing what's right in front of them, and it's because they are existentially repelled by the uh, by the by the uh, by the implications of that, and here are the real implications, it is, well, I'm not, I'm not, I am not, not actually a liberal uh, subject, I'm not an ego, I am not me, like that. that's why it's it's it's the socially like perfected concept of liberalism, but it is motivated by the liberal fantasy that we are eternal subjects, not socially embedded, not determined by our conditions, and we and I'm sorry, that's what we are, and that is why change if it happens will not be initiated by some sort of collective act of will, it will be changing conditions, changing our... responses to those conditions, and Marx's conception was is that because of the common experience of exploitation by capitalism, you would get this new fusion of liberal subjects into a new type of relationship that is more like what they're imagining, an expansive social type of of existence, but you can't just port the liberal self into that, you have to assume that you will literally have a change. in the subjective experience of life, definitions of words, what symbols mean, like what the self is, and that's going to change your relationship to everybody else around you, your notion of obligation, your notion of social, social ritually pledging yourself to something other than you, alienating some degree of autonomy to collective to act collectively, it is failed to occur, that is a true point, but anarchism has failed even worse, it has not even been able to assert power, anywhere that has not popped like a soap bubble, much like those wonderful north American Woodland societies that they jack off to in the last chapter. so that's my beef with the book, even though I highly recommend everybody read it for the details, read it for the putting on its head uh, a lot of your inbed, like here's it does challenge a lot of sort of unthinking cliches that a lot of us have, including myself, instead of like really fleshed out narratives of things like the deep past, which are hard to get your head around a lot of ways so you sort of let cliche fill in the hole. this does a great job of breaking up your cliches and challenging them and making you look at them again, but it does not do what they wanted to do, which is turn people into anarchists, at least not this guy, and uh, one of the things that really helped me sharpen my uh critique of this, what's wrong with my audio? why do these people do this to me? okay. um one of things that help me sharpen a lot of my uh thoughts about this and really like h in on what was bugging me the whole time ever is reading it because like i said it's a fun read it's a lot of cool detail and there's nice conjectures things that like slap you in the face but the whole time i'm thinking like i got a pebble in my shoe and i've got like a to big wallet i'm just not centered and it's because there's so much of this book that while you're reading it feels very convincing because of the language use that if you look back on it it's really just conjecture filling in huge gaps and they they kind of win you over by winking you and saying yeah we're no we're doing this but just like just take our word for it so we can keep going problem is that's the whole book it gets entirely marbled that way it doesn't it doesn't pay back the uh the faith the good faith of accepting their reasoning with some big resolute uh resolution to the argument that like rests on firmer footing and so you're like Okay, yeah, it was a little shaky getting here, but now that you're here, you can't deny this, if it had gotten there i would have given, would have uh, forgiving a lot more, but it just doesn't, the whole thing is that, it's just all shaky foundations the whole way around, and then basically just saying, yeah, but it wouldn't it be pretty to think so, that's it persuade, that's the final pitch, and anyway, the thing that I read that helped me really pinpoint a lot of things that were bugging me reading it, is a review of the book by my main man, Walter Sheidle, anybody who's been a long follower of the pod uh knows that i'm a big shidle head, i think that uh, he's a great, one of the great living non-marxist materialist historians, like he is absolutely not a marxist, he is one of those guys who sees the teleology of capitalism and says good, the machine should be in charge, and it's like, okay, cool, uh, but because he does have that. like he understands that this is a process of this emerging system, and a marxist would say this is the opposite of humanity, uh, guys like shitl even if the... are really thinking, no, this is the apotheosis of humanity, that makes them able to see clearly a lot of stuff that grab grow because they're romantic liberals who think that their liberal subjectivity is eternal and not historically contingent and that it was different and it will be different in other contexts and in the future, it's not some fixed identity point, i'm sorry with rights that is like somehow uh transcendent of time and space. uh so shidle one of the uh anyway but his book uh have recommended before escape from Rome great great leveler really good I think he's working on a new one that I very excited to read uh but he wrote a review this book which is like a perfect match because he is in many sense the absolute opposite of these guys because he's also a liberal but whereas the grab grow liberals are repelled by the machine Shedle is a fan and what in the when their job is I mean if your job is mounting a barricade and fighting a war, we know who we'd rather be fighting with, grab grow, obviously, we know who'd side in like a a battle, or actual battle we would be on, but in the question of determining like what the what is happening in the world around us, shedles uh demonic uh uh submission to the machine makes him a superior historian, so shidle reviews this book, and I read the Shedle. review and shedles uh shedle also like i says that the book is worth reading, fun to read uh does challenges a lot of orthodoxies meaningfully uh and for a lay person especially is a great way to break up you know uh stuff that might be like old in and an accumulated muck in our uh popular you know pop science understanding of the past but like their actual you know argument is just absolutely founded on uh a lot of either stuff that has been around for a long time that is not mind-blowing uh that the that all of the relevant fields have have totally assimilated into their understanding and therefore not mind blowing or it's just conjecture based on that. uh like a good example of that is they say that in a lot of these societies that eventually become uh basically it they say everywhere that there is no fixed correlating relationship between uh you know things like agriculture and urbanization and uh and regimes of hierarchy because people moved around within them and there were seasonal cycles where people come together live communally under like control monarch and then they would disperse and for uh Grab Grow the fact that that might that existed that that pattern existed means that those things getting together into a group don't cause hierarchy, but another way to look at this is that once again, on a long enough time scale, those that phenomenon of people coming together in those formations is what prepares them to become permanent, like if they stayed out in - in like you know forager groups that never came together, how would they ever have just how would they ever have created a hierarchy? like what he's what they're actually describing with this cyclical thing is the the building of the preconditions for the hierarchy? people aren't going to submit to a permanent hierarchy before they have had the temporary one, and like that is to me an even more persuasive. description of that evidence, but the only difference, but um, and there's absolutely no like his evidentiary uh distinction between that interpretation and grab grows, grab grows where it's just, yeah, they were all chilling uh, and that means that they're never going to turn into you know uh, concentrations of power, even though they did everywhere else, and how did everywhere else by first having those cyclical seasonal relations. what they want to say is that because this didn't happen instantaneously? because there's no correlation between like you have agriculture, boom, you have civilization, you have urbanization, boom, you have hierarchy. because they're saying there's no like moment of like big bang explosion and correlated between like material relationships, then they're not materially determined, but what if it's a gradual process? what if it's a thing that happens over a long time? and it accumulates and reaches an inflection point and nobody at the time realizes that's happening. like they always want to say on this thing that this doesn't mean that uh these things being together here it means that they were not on the cusp of developing some sort of uh hierarchical relationship but what about the places where there was agriculture that came after foraging because you're saying because foraging existed at one point before the agriculture that there was no cusp situation but then there's never a cusp anywhere nobody is ever on cusp, you you've gotten rid of the concept of the cusp, and that's fine, because it doesn't tell us anything about the uh, determinative relationship, like if things like agriculture and urbanization do not cause hierarchy to emerge, they provide an accelerant and catalyst for them to be developed once the things that do, they have still not even gotten to, maybe it's care regimes, so okay, your care regime changes like they imagine, your care regime is now one of domination, now how does that go from something that breaks up cyclically to something that concentrates and becomes a self-perpetuating state based on class domination? it is provided the accelerant and catalyst of access to say cereals, access to say uh horses and draft animals. the things that you're saying didn't cause it guarantee that it will emerge if the thing that did cause it happens and the thing that did cause it to happen happened and would have to have happened and inevitably would have happened and how do we know because say it with me it happened if it happened one place in the human biome human the guy of ball we live on it would happen somewhere it was going to happen somewhere. and why it happened some place and not others is not, well here, I guess they were like better at facilitating one another and they were more chill dudes or something, they had better vibes, that's basically what a boils town, oh yeah, in North America they just had better vibes. Okay, great, but in the place where they have bad vibes, they also have serial agriculture and horses. so it doesn't matter whose vibes or what, they could have had great vibes over in the other place too, the exact same good vibes, but if they have good vibes and agriculture and horses, maybe they get bad vibes, maybe the bad vi, the vibe changes, there is a vibe shift, and it has nothing to do with uh human choice, it has to do with ecological conditions, resources, access to resources and uh the environment. like for example, less stable relationship to food, because what is where all these places where people had good vibes and nothing changed, also had super abundance of food, where did it, where did uh civilization emerge in places where abundance fluctuated, and all of a sudden these good vibe people have the same vibes as north Americans do, all of a sudden the vibe shifted because more more trauma associated with seeking limited resources messes up you know the the the vibe in the community, but then maybe in North America the same thing happens, but then the the the stable relationship with the ecology smooths it out, but maybe somewhere else because you have a more unstable relationship with the environment, it persists, oh and also access to things like horse. and fucking serials, because one thing that they point out here that is kind of honestly a dagger in the heart of the argument is that they say you had globally you had this 5,00 year period before there's any kind of like uh dominant social structures, and why don't we talk more about that than the 500 where we have them? and one of the reasons is cuuse it was first, which means it's a foreign country in a way that the... the 500 years that came after and that rebuilt society every day psychially and materially along those lines, fixed it, froze it, is more meaningful, but forget all that, worldwide we see that there is about a 7,000 year long period between the adoption of agriculture in an area, and the creation of these settled conglomerations, like one of the things they want to point out that grabrow want to use to point out that there's no like determined a relationship is in the emergence of the holosine that 700 years that that that period when this the gun goes off basically the stabilization of the environment after the retreat of the uh of the glaciers there's all these areas and that some of them didn't get any development of uh hierarchy and and uh domination and others did, but the thing is that every place that developed hierarchy that developed the state had was one of those early areas and the ones that didn't like for example North America and and uh the Polynesia did not have sufficient serial in their environment to create the sort of storable, durable, taxable surplus that allows the state to flourish. so you got a 7,00 year period, so it's 7,00 years from the from the emergence of life in the fertal crecent and indus valley and China and everything until you get the states, but because humans settled east to they moved east to west, right? and the new world is literally the new world, not because it was discovered by Europeans, but because the... people got their last, so the people those those uh, it took longer for agriculture to emerge, and in North America, where grabro make their like resting argument about the possibility of humanity to avoid domination, they didn't get maze, which is the only real cereal in north north in the Americas at that time, and and which is an inferior for the purposes of taxation and storage and uh all that inferior. to other cereals like grain and rice, so it's it's one of the least uh useful cereals and it showed up even later, so guess what, by the time that Europeans are knocking on the door of North America, it has been about 7,000 years, so all you're really arguing here is that there you get about 7,00 years and then one way or another it's coming. It's knocking on your door because of that relationship between human social structures and their environment, their environment, and and like their big thing is they they picks on, they insist that if if something is not the proximate cause of something else then it did not determine it, and I'm sorry, proximate causes are fun to understand and useful. uh to especially when you're talking about like the recent past and applying it to the life you have now, but when you're talking about like real like defining answers to questions like what caused something, they are meaningless, it's like a building, once once like this the the the um, once a controlled demolition of a building begins, it's going to fall down. you don't there's going to be specific things that are going to cause the the the uh thing like struts to fail and you can describe those, but that's not uh the thing that did it, the the general trends are what answer general questions, and what these guys try to do is answer general questions with these proximate cases, but a general trend cannot be answered by finding the approximate causes for it, you need a general uh uh influence and it's the fucking environment uh and like some of the stuff they use for example to talk about uh cities and and how urban life did not equal a hierarchy involves just like making stuff up like the first cities were not in mesoamerica they were in the fertal crestent China in this valley that is where the versities were like they're literally just uh fudging fudging numbers there uh and and also their big example of tatuwan the place that had like monumental architecture and apparently when it was built did almost immediately have hierarchy like th tichwan started off by by grabro's own admission as this uh cathedral of executions and ball sports and aristocratic uh violence that uh mark the inka and and the aztexs and the olmex before them and then they was overthrown and you had this temporary like 200 year period where instead of building temples and monuments and executing people they built public housing uh and it is a very interesting story it's one of the most interesting parts of the book something i had no idea no idea had ever existed uh but also it's literally the only one you can find so like if it's an outlier. you haven't proven anything, but grabro basically take this and say this is the model of early states, also that the uh the fertal crestent societies had all that stuff about assemblies. That's all just wishcasting, it's like, here's public forums, they must have been where people came together to talk about political issues, it's like, maybe, maybe, and once again, if this, if if if filling that gap in with conjecture led to a greater, more salient truth, it would be worth piking, but bot as just one of another bits of speculation, it just falls apart, and and other stuff, they just allied, like the... when they compare the cyclical social arrangement of the megasites of Ukraine to bask villages that still to this day use this like circular social structure uh to to do non-hierarchical uh civic um life and he compared them and said the the evidence that the bask still exist proves that like these social models worked uh the bask villages are not built out as circles there's no uh circular relationship it is it is a a clan relationship that is extended over distance, like these are farm houses spread out throughout the countryside, so it is literally taking two different types of cyclicality and equating them because they're the same shape, even though one of them is is physical and the other one is like conceptual and their whole argument that the state never emerges that you never have a state uh is essentially that because you don't have things that correspond to the the 19th century German definition of state that was built by like uh the era of great great power nationalism in Europe like the the entire uh discipline of history as we understand it as as a social science was uh uh was founded in Will Hellmine Germany in the late 19th century guys like Leopold von Ranka and they defined a lot of the the they define the terms that we use for a lot of historical uh concepts one of them being the state and grabro take this definition and say because that didn't exist back then and and you can't recognize it in these things then there is no such thing as a state the state isn't a concept. and it's again because they disembody things from their social relations and then they make them eternal concept concepts, and there is no such thing, but there is one one bit of really sneaky shit here that uh stood out to me because I people who have uh been watching these that I have noted, I noted already, I i put like I've generally read this thing credulously like, okay, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt while I'm reading this because I want... you know, I want to engage with it in good faith, and the story they were telling was very compelling, so I I wanted to give them that benefit, because I I wanted to hear the next thing in you know, an open framework so that I can you know absorb it uh, but this one I put a little astrox next to and said, what are we actually saying here, and that was when he's describing the uh, the mesoamerican tribe that or the mesoamerican uh civilization community, whatever you want to say. that allied with Cortes against the azax when when the the Spanish showed up and uh he describes their uh their power structure there as this like democracy as essentially as an occupy uh wall street style general assembly everybody comes together and debates the questions of the day and uh then uh comes to a consensus decision. and then acts on it, and of course i pointed out at the time, it's very funny that like this, this the one actual example of like real democracy being uh enacted in that they actually talk about, like a specific moment is these people saying, hey let's uh, let's ally with these literal demons in human skin, these fucking shock-faced monsters, these metal suntars belching fire that clearly want to consume the entire fucking content. and people at the assemblies were saying these people are a curse, and they said, you know what, fuck it, we're going for it, but anyway, so like that's separate from the greater question that I also raised, which is what is the social, what is the political economy in here, because you're saying everybody together is getting is deliberating, but is this like a bunch of yoman farmers who all work their own land or is there some relationship of dependence here, of domination as it were, socially like class power. forgetting, oh, everybody gets to assemble in the in the in the great hallway to deliberate, yay, this is democracy, okay, but what is the social structure, and I didn't know, and so I said, what is it? uh, but this is fascinating. Sheidle is able to basically answer my question here by uh completing a quote that Grabgrow shorten intentionally to try to make their point. So uh, when trying to argue that this group was democratic. Uh, they quote Cortes in his letters back to uh Spain, where he says, quote, it is uh, that the the their government, the talan talacal government. uh is quote, almost like that of Venice or Genoa or Pieza, because there is no one supreme leader, or I'm sorry, uh, Venice or Genoa or piza, because there is no one supreme ruler, uh, and that's that's where Grabgrow ended, but the the full quote is, there are many lords all living in this city, and people who are tillers of the soil are their vassals, though each one has lands to himself, some more than others. in taking an undertaking war they all gather together and theus assembled they decide and plan them now you might say oh okay they all decide so even uh the vasssels decide but it's like the valsels decide now are you calling this a fucking democracy the thehenians had that where the slave owners would gather together and fucking debate but in reality this was a hereditary aristocracy where about 100 people got together, the roman senate, basically, so the exact things that ruled in the old world where regimes of domination had risen up like a monster and destroyed humanity, are also existing here, well congrat your fucking lations, now you might say, oh he was just uh, he was just assuming he was because he was, he was from Europe, he couldn't recognize any other freedom, well okay, then his thing about them being a democracy doesn't mean anything either, either, either he had an insight or he didn't, if he couldn't see anything in in front of his face because he was too blinded by the ideology he grew up with, well then it's a meaningless uh piece of evidence either way. so yeah, that that's that's that's shedles. review, he says a bunch of other stuff, it's all very cutting uh, you can tell that he's pretty kind of annoyed by how much they like run down their colleagues in in anthropology and archaeology, the social sciences, how much they want to shit on them because their a bunch of brainwashed rubes who have ignored all this evidence, and shedle's like, look, they all, all all this evidence has not been ignored, it's all been absorbed, and a lot of the people are, a lot of people have said a lot of the same stuff you're saying, they just have not uh decided to create a flight of fancy to support a political project, but there's a quote here at the, I want to read just the last paragraph of the of shitle's review, somebody asked where it's published, I think it's uh, I think it's in a, it's probably in a paywalled uh journalistic or scholarly document, and of course you know, this is the problem we have with trying to square the circle of - you know pop uh scholarly pursuit as political activism versus pursuit of the truth, because these guys are trying to do a political thing and shedl is trying to make a a academic you know refined point, and so they're doing different things, but I would say that uh, I would say that on the the narrower question of like, okay, grab grow, doing this politically and god bless you, people should do this stuff, i think i do this stuff, i really do feel like stuff like hell of presidents and the thing i'm going to do about the the crisis of the 17th century, i really feel like i'm trying to do the same thing grabgrow is, but because he's an anarchist, because they're anarchists, they're wrong basically, it boils down to that, you know, it's like you're not wrong, you're just incorrect, and that means i have to when reading it uh try to understand that. Uh, so anyway, this is Sheidle's last paragraph where he after just like winding up by saying, their big failure is that they reject material explanations, they del, they they reject technological, I mean they don't just, they don't even reject them, they fail to uh integrate them into their analysis, technology and and environment, technology and ecology are invisible, they're not even... engaged with, they're they're hand waved away, and these are like the things that, I'm sorry, this this is you can agree or disagree, like this is where it's it, you can't really make any kind of empirical argument, it is down to gut feeling. These things either determine us in a significant way and something political flows from that, like it's not just an isolated fact that we can skip over, it is determining of our conditions and therefore determining our choices, so we have to engage with it, or it's a big gross boogy man that makes us all uh, basically their their idea is that the idea of determinism and and uh materialism are... prevent us from doing effective activism, if we believed harder, we would fix things, like they literally think, if you consider technology, if you consider ecology, you are submitting to the matrix, and uh, once again, that is, that is a question of like deep epistemology that cannot be resolved, never will be resolved, and can't. you can just circle around them forever and that is what this has all been has been me circling around our like conflicting world views circling around each other like a little like a little uh atomic particle and then throwing off light in the form of these posts that you then absorb and then you can take from all of this whatever and apply it to your life aesthetically. emotionally, intellectually, and hopefully practically, but anyway, this is the quote at the end of the end of the uh review that I thought really sums it up, after saying like look, you're just, you're too idealism, you're doing too much idealism, it's not, it's not to somebody who needs to know, it is not either persuasive, and if it is persuasive uh, it leads them in the wrong direction, like that's where it boils down to, like to somebody who has a different uh like essential position. It's not going to make me uh, it's not going to change my mind, but for somebody who doesn't have that is just sort of uh unmored intellectually, but wants to do the right thing, it'll push you in the wrong direction, so that's why it's a failure in both respects, even though it's a very good book so people should read, that is, there you go, that is, this is the contradiction at the heart of everything, the fuels and powers everything, so this is shidle's last paragraph, their idealist purism traps graber and raingro in acade. of their own making, acknowledgement of materialist perspectives would have helped them draw more meaningful connections between past and present. if it was their mobile lifestyle and hybrid mode of subsistence that made it easier for halone foragers to step in and out of different forms of cooperation than it was for fold blown farmers who found themselves tied to their lands and crops. how do we compare? do service economies, digital tools and globalization, hold out the promise of a new dawn. materialism is not the enemy of historical understanding, it is essential to it, nor is it the enemy of social activism, it might even be its best friend, and even though he's coming from a different like political perspective than i, i think shell and i have a very share a belief that you cannot act effectively off of faulty foundations, if you're being motivated intellectually, here's the thing, like this is where we talk about how like the coalition of humanity is always a intraclass. combination of intellectual and emotional uh uh connections to the course of action of humans against the machine, and for people who don't need to be intellectually convinced, don't aren't operating, i should say differently, they need to be intellectually convinced, but their conviction doesn't rest on intellectual belief, it rests on a deeper foundation of emotional connection, This is just going to be like, oh, if I'm just a, if I'm a pixy, if I, if I believe hard enough, I can just imagine away all of the chains of technology and ecology that have rendered me a fundamentally different subject than the people he's talking about. I do not have the, I don't have the the uh, capacity to flee into the unknown to remake in wilderness that allowed all of the liberty that he describes in this book to accumulate. I will say though that uh if if Graber was still alive and he read that shitle review he would probably challenge the guy or duel because he was a prickly motherfucker uh when debt came out he uh basically went ham on anyone who said that it wasn't like perfectly accurate uh and I remember I read a a crooked timber symposium on debt when it came out and all the uh articles were very respectful and all of most of them said the book had a lot of... uh benefits and that it helped reframe a lot of their thinking on deeps issues, but that specifically there was a lot of allighting and there was a lot of sort of uh fudging uh and then they you know and some people and they had a lively debate like well does that really matter are we just talking semantics and it it was a pretty good back and forth and the last uh the last blog post was going to be uh graber sort of responding and like they had these symposiums on crooked timber is a uh webs is a blog in the old blog days i'm too i'm a million years old the before twitter there were blogs uh and people would get together on blogs to talk about things and i got to say one of the things that has accelerated human insanity is that we got rid of the forums and blog culture that allowed people to self segregate and now have been dumped and mass onto the internet and we we don't have rules for it and it's driving us insane um and the last when they had these symposiums the last culminating post would be by the author who then respond to everybody then they would have a debate and not a debate they would have you know a good faith discussion and grabber went on there and he just said fuck all of you you all are a bunch of fucking pinhead shit fucks for i mean obviously not literally but in academic language like in in the incredibly cozy langual of uh of academia, which all those people who were writing were part of, he just went like ham on them, he went beast mode, and it's uh, it's very funny that to imagine him responding to that review because he would not take it kindly, um, but I feel like that's a very similar thing, you got you got a lot of great detail in that book, um, I think in that book, the the fudging is different and better, because his cumulative argument is, I think. persuasive about you know America wielding debt as you know the the basic framework for domination of the economy of of of of a global capitalism, but of course you know it it doesn't have the greater framework is, but anyway it's a that's another interesting book that is once again like spackled over with a lot of fancy, but there is a fundamental problem with arguing like a debt jubilee would bring ba bring human you know autonomy back because again if we can't farm for ourselves, if we can't fend for ourselves, we are constrained in a way that other people you're imagining wouldn't be. somebody also asked about guns, germs and steel, and i feel like that's another book in this, this kind of bucket where it's like worth reading, and i think worth reading to break up, what i said earlier, the sort of off-handed, unthought through, shase about history that you carry around in your head, because there's tons of strawmans in uh everything everywhere all the time, the dawn of everything, um, the straw men are everywhere, but like they could argue, well okay, sure academics know all this stuff, but the general public doesn't, and it's like, yeah, but I mean the the general public doesn't have doesn't uh, know much, you know, the general public is is pretty, there's not a lot in their head, there's not a lot of space in their head devoted to you, understanding early humanity, there's just a few big cliches, and because this stuff of crudes over time and is communicated like first in academia, then into the greater culture, then into just sort of folk understanding, like that is a long-term process, so yeah, like a lot of the a lot of the notions that people who even do have concepts about the the the deep past, which isn't that many people, a lot of people don't have anything there, it's completely. because it thinks in terms of deep causes that it rips human life away from the narrative of autonomy that that animates the liberal understanding of the self and of history that's good because i would say that is the big those are the biggest kidney stones and the ones that nestle like a russian doll all the other misconceptions about like human civilization who we are, how we got here? the value of human life, what we should be doing with it are around a narrativized understanding of of human life that centralizes autonomy and will, because that's how you get the the vast majority of people in the western world totally fine with a horrifyingly uh unequal social regime that sees people starving. in the billions amidst unconceivable plenty, it's because they have it coming, it's because they are morally calpable, and if you're understanding of of of history of is a narrativized collection of individual decisions by people and groups, then you have a narrative that makes it their fault. If you understand it though in these terms, then the the the judgment disappears, uh, the moral distinction disappears and you just have people, all of whom deserve exactly what all the other of them do at the exact same amount, and honestly. "these guys are too fully committed to anarchist moralism and liberal moralism to to make the connection, but if you accept this, another thing you can take from it is, well uh, I guess the the native Americans were pretty good, you know, they they were able to vibe, but humans just let this happen to them, and at the end of the day it's the fault of those who will refuse to change their minds." Okay, so that was the book, we'll have a little chat next week, I'll I'll tease it now, I think we're going to go with Leo Panich's making of global capitalism, got to get a copy of that, don't own one, but uh, and I like I like to get the... i i have, i've done audiobooks but i've gotten to the point, no, i've done uh kindle, it's so convenient, but there's something about having a a a physical copy that's more uh reassuring, but anyway, but maybe not, i will confirm it next week, like i said, probably wednesday, so take it.
