 every time, every time, every single time, ah, no, man, no, it's the time. or the hour, sometimes I just got to get on here, regardless of the time of day, all right, looks like we're good, my microphone working everybody, that sound good, turn that mic up, oh wait. ball me indeed, it is a, the air is thick, the air is juicy, just got finished with that uh, tropical storm remnant, so I will probably be sweating during the course of this video, I hope it's not too traumatic for people, because I know I do a lot of it, uh, today I wanted to talk. sort of about a big picture thing, not i'm not really trying to derive any practical uh advice from it i guess i'm not trying to like turn it into a action item i'm just trying to like talk through something just as like a general theory for exactly why the fuck the left whatever you want to call that in america is so uh fucked on all side, and I think it boils down to faith, not religious faith necessarily, although that's part of it in a in a different way, but the sense that no one has faith in the project, and I don't think that's anyone's fault, I want to make that clear, everything I'm going to say. goes for everyone i can think of, including myself, so not pointing any fingers at anyone, trying to just for myself, and hopefully for anybody listening who wants to tell me what they think, their response, this is my thought about it, is that because of the collapse of the institutional left, which is what we're living, like i would say that technically we don't have a left in this country because we do not have the structure. one and without the structure of something in a political sense you don't really have it. opinions takes even organizations as long as they're not coordinating and as long as people are operating without any sort of as i've talked about disciplinary or coordinating mechanism in their lives to direct their energies uh there is no real structure and that's a legacy of 40 years of intentional neoliberal politics and and uh the spectaclization and the the the atamization, we've talked about all this, like why it's happened is not a question, or why or mystery, the reality is is that because there's no structure, everyone now is a moment where is living in through a moment of unprecedented, i would say crisis in america in terms of its long-term viability as a fucking project and the individual viability of any one person. 'who isn't already wealthy to even survive, I mean my god, literally now, they're talking about sending everybody back to school in September to just give everybody fucking more disease as the numbers keep going up as we're probably going to be talking about half a million dead by the end of the year, and the reality of that being absolutely in the same moment and in the same reality as a world where there's no left and where the attempt to build one out of the Bernie Sanders campaign failed completely uh, it's a horrifying thing, and I think the way that it shapes the discourse, because that's all anyone really talks about when they talk about the left is people talking, because there's nothing else to really do other than protest, which people have been doing, but which as time has gone on, the protests have grown more. confrontational and they've gotten off the front pages. I saw a a tweet by someone said, none of these protests are getting attention now because they're not violent anymore, there's not. uh, there's not escalation, there's not rioting uh, and that's and that's why now it's being why, why the why the protests are now kind of being processed and ignored, uh, and they blame that on people uh, taking seriously liberal adminitions against violent rioting as as counterproductive, and I could see why people would think that because we're online all the time, but I think a more more compelling materialist explanation is that... the cops kicked everyone's fucking ass, the cops kicked the shit out of everybody, started throwing people in jail, people started getting run over at protests and i think a lot of people as the as passions cooled a little bit as they do over time you know fucking second a lot thermodynamics and and as that initial rush of like from being out of cooped up in the houses to out into the street petered out it was not met with a corresponding rise in or organizational capacity that could allow a continued escalation with of conflict with the state to be sustained, like there's no way to keep fighting the state me uh productively, all you're going to do is end up getting beat up and go to jail, for no reason, i mean other than to express your personal horror at the situation, but you you're doing it without any hope that it's going to build, that it's going to develop, it's going to mean anything, and people want. the sacrifice to mean something, and who wouldn't everyone does, and without that possibility of sacrifice meaning something, fewer people are willing to risk, are willing to sacrifice, and that's totally understandable and reasonable, that's way, that's that's, what else are they supposed to do, and that that pide pulling back is because of the lack of organizational um, so that's like the actual material reason that people don't have faith in the project, because their efforts cannot be put to use, but what that means, the reality of that, the reality of that general sense of hopelessness, even among people who are suffering wildly and are wildly radicalized, is that when we try to do politics in a mindset of hopelessness, not a conscious mindset, mind you, I think a a deeper awareness of futility, it means that we instinctively filter politics not through the lens of effectiveness of action, but through personal pleasure, because there is a like the the fundamental leftist uh project of recognizing the common good, the idea that we all share an interest in replacing capitalism with a system that is not exploitative. that common interest is abstract, whereas our specific concrete desires are real to us, they're real. anyway, we feel them more, they're there every moment, we don't have to conjure them, they're there uh, and so if we're committed to politics, committed to being political, but we've kind of already ruled out uh, efficacy as the main thing to be focused on, we are going to then go to personal pleasure as the thing to focus on, and once again, that's not. predictable or something you can really blame people for. what else are they supposed to do? because effective political action, one, no one really knows what it is, and two, whatever it is, it's probably going to be in some respect, boring or tedious or hard, and why would you want to do something that is tedious or difficult if it's not going to accomplish anything? On the other hand, you could approach politics libidinally as a as a zone of uh of personal identity formation, as a way to gain social prestige, and as a way to satisfy your emotional rage, I mean, so much, so many people are so fucking pissed and have every right to be, and who privilege their ability to express that anger on someone somewhere, and I think that's a lot. of course they suck and and your life sucks and their life is great and they're whining about getting canceled, of course you want to yell at them. now the thing is though, that's not going to accomplish anything, and as i've said, like the one two justification for cancel culture is one, um, you know, it's people, it's response, it's people getting uh, it's it's it's speech having uh consequences, but also no one ever gets canceled, well that means there are no consequences. and that means it's just for personal satisfaction of the person doing the doing the owning, and that's what the whole, the whole box, the whole the the skinner box of of internet politics is just a libidinal sync, it's it's it's politics is personal pleasure, and i think that that is not the fault of the PMC or uh woke capital or anything, it is the inevitable result. of living in a world without hope, you can recognize the horror of the world around you and recognize the bad guys, but if you don't really think that there's anything that you can do to have any hope of changing it, then you're gonna look for other things to make your life more bearable, because it's getting more unbearable every day, and it's that lack of, it's that lack of uh, any real belief in in progress, I think that's at the root of every dysfunction that gets teased out on every level, I mean there are people, my god who have decided that they're going to create some sort of post-marxist theory that that redefines class and says class is not about a relationship to a means of production, it's about i i guess a cultural afect or having gone to college, that's what real class is now because those those people are the ones to direct the culture, the discourse, and you've got people willing to just throw a key marxist concept out of the window, so that they can stay online, so that because they can fight the PMC online, they can jous with the PMC online, they can drag them, and so they've decided that actually these are the real rulers of the world, this is the real ruling class, because they're the ones that I can actually yell at, they're the ones that I can have. effect on or even in my mind imagine so and that's because there is no effective action that anyone feels like they can take, so they're going to take the action that is most satisfying, most personally satisfying. so one level of the lack of faith is just the fact that nobody has any real investment in a project that they think is going to make anything better, but there's a deeper. problem too, and this one is is uh, I think another one that's endemic to post-modern, capitalist culture, writ large, nothing having to do with politics or uh, or anything, it's that, it's that we in the west, I would say broadly, and more and more over the world, as capitalism conqueres, capitalism becomes the only language of of meaning uh have been conditioned to in the absence of God because God is dead nichi is right about that 19th century boom blown away done for like obviously people still believe in God but there's doubt now that didn't used to be there at least more of it and it leaves it it it's essentially we killed God but we left the devil because now it's hard for anyone it's a struggle for anyone. to invest supernatural, to invest real belief in a supernatural future, if they have gone, if they have a a basic understanding of science, uh, it's harder and harder, you can do it, but it's harder, it's a struggle, it's more of a struggle than it used to be, uh, and like that was inevitable, you know, like we built these gods in ignorance and now we're less ignorant and they don't make sense anymore, like that's supposed to happen, but the problem is is that when you abolish the infinite as as if you abolish like a real of infinite where a spiritual where you can imagine yourself, then you have two choices, you can either realize that the self is actually not any different than anything else in the universe, and that is essentially an illusion, and that it can be overcome, or you worship the self as God, you redefine God as your own. uh sense perception, identity and desires and wouldn't you know it, that is actually what we ended up building out of the ruvel. the old religious traditions, because what other engine does capitalism have other than personal, the satisfaction of personal desires, and so now we have a genuine conflict within every person in America, at least who is trying to uh build a left political praxis, in that their commitment to a general well-being, is in direct conflict with their individual desires, and of course they're going to privilege their individual desires. the only thing, there's only two things that can make that equation flip, one is if you do like annihilate your ego, which is very difficult, i haven't done it, that's for fucking sure, it's a it's a it's a it's a process, and and a lot of people, most people are never even going to come to the point of realizing that... should even be a goal of their lives uh and the other is finding something to believe in as a project as in believe in its efficacy and effectiveness or at the very least to believe in your individual uh that you are individually playing a role in it moving forward and i think and I think that the moment is demanding a new left organization, a new left structure, and also honestly a new spiritual understanding, like this, like the the personal ego satisfaction that is built that is encoded in the DNA of uh, of our social order, like stripped of every... thing, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, all those things are defined by personal ego satisfaction through the market, but that has to be, that's that's that's, I mean, we're seeing it exhausted in front of us, I mean, what, what are all those videos of people freaking out and melting down about having to wear a mask, what was all the people wait, protesting about not being able to go to Chiles, it's our our b, the bounds of our lives have gotten smaller and smaller and smaller, our our zone of actual autonomy is getting smaller and all we have are our desires which are mediated and which are essentially handed to us by a culture, and if we can't satisfy those desires, then we don't have freedom, we don't have individuality, we aren't the beings that we thought we were, and being able to be that is become harder and harder to do, and trying to do it is turning into fucking suicide, it is now literally suicidal to try to assert yourself at the marketplace. the way that we've been taught is the sum total of human fulfillment, so we've reached the point where this these things are no longer tenable at any level, like the economy is obviously basically uh uh exanguinated, and the and there's a virus that is physically preventing people, at least some people, people who are not deluted enough to just ignore the reality, from engaging in those self-building activities of satisfaction, and in the left we have seen among leftists i guess i should say since i don't think the left is real, we have seen a this this uh libidinal idulgence replacing uh any kind of group project, everyone is in it to satisfy their pleasure, and they could, and a lot of people say, no, i want everything to be better, i want, i want things to be better, what are you talking about pleasure? but one of those things that creates pleasure is being seen as good by.... imagining oneself to be good better than the system that they're in, imagining oneself not to be an exploiter, and most importantly imagining oneself to be being seen by others as good, and so that structures the discourse too, it becomes like I've talked about, it becomes an entrepreneurial war of all against all to be the best person. because that's all we can see, but I think because we're at a moment of crisis and because conditions are changing every second, I really think that both those problems are going to uh be addressed, not by me, not by any project that's currently existing, certainly not by anybody posting online about it, uh, I think that that the the insufficiency of the current models will... essentially require in a darwinian sense uh a change in approach both spiritually and personally uh and and organizationally, what that's going to look like I don't know, and the real question, whether it's too late uh to be affected, and those are two questions, the answer to which I don't know, but like I said, this is not prescriptive, this is just be trying to talk through like what it seems to me to be the root of a lot of the the um, the uh pathologies uh, that seem to be metastasizing, and all I could do is just hope, like we all have to do, that that the untenability of the moment will push us towards building some new moral system where where where that ego gratification is uh is subsumed uh into a understanding that the real that there is real meaning in struggle. real meaning in suffering for a cause, and most importantly that you get enough people who think that way, all of a sudden you've got an organization that can effect change, now I'm not saying it's going to happen magically, and it's not going to happen spiritually, it's going to be a response to eruptions in the material conditions, uh, but I do think that it's inevitable, like I said, the thing I don't. is whether it's going to be enough or enough time. I got to say that the people who want to like redefine class to be not about material conditions in relationship to means of production. That is honestly, it's tragic because you can see where it comes from, it it comes from being terminally frustrated with the awful bad faith mailstrom of of discourse and of the there is sort of a reifying and um and disciplining. function within you know from the media to to like a generalized population of mostly college educated people online uh that that establishes like a standard of behavior and or more importantly a standard of outlook and a standard of uh opinions uh and then punishes people who do disagree with them and a lot of those opinions end up insisting upon the primacy of focusing on non-material. conditions on saying no, we can't do any socialism until we fight racism, as though those are inextricable, as though, as those there's a way to fight racism that does not uh, those are way to fight racism alone that will not leave the structures that recreate racial racial disparities, that's just going to recreate itself, and that's very frustrating to see, and i get why people get mad at it, but not only by doing that, not only are you of course committing. against Marx, but like I mean who cares at the end of the day, conditions changed, he died a long time ago, we have to acknowledge things are different, and I think that there is some sort, there is some um insight in pointing out that that there is essentially at this point a massive divide broadly between among white people, college educated ones and non-college educated ones on questions of culture, and both sides suffer are suffering from economic precarity, like... the like the argument that the PMC whatever is downwardly mobile is true, but that because of the difference in their conditioning, the response to precarity is different, the response to polige educated white is to clean harder to wokeness as a way to fill that sense of anxiety with the at least the satisfaction of being being good, and then there is there can be an opposite response, non-ag collegy. get away as conditions get worse to cling on to cultural explanations the other way, cultural demonization the other way, and that that is like a mutual reinforcing process and that's bad, it's very bad and it needs to be overcome uh, but it cannot be overcome online, because - it's not true to say the internet isn't real life, because obviously people learn how to behave from watching other people online, and then they take it offline. and then that impacts the way that they relate to people in the real world, it impacts what activism they do, it impacts the way that they approach their lives, it's real, but it is an after effect, it is epinomenon. it is it is um hyper phenomenal, it is superstructure, and what that means more than anything is that you can't change it there, you can't change it at the level of discourse, there is no amount of posting, zero amount of posting that can change anything, because while it reinforces existing structures, it is not generative, the structures are generated, and so by redefining class to be about... whether you went to college uh and determining that that means that oh good i get to stay online all day to argue with these people, well you've seated the field and like i said i understand why buse there's no other alternative and that feels good even if it feels bad it feels good you know like everybody gets mad getting mad that's the flip side of being happy uh there's a book about college football rivalries and i think it's called to hate like this is to be happy forever i think is the name of it and i can't think name for a book about the internet, and the other thing, the other problem with that, I mean, for one thing, you're doomed, you you've neutered yourself, you've decided I'm going to stay staring at the wall with the flickering flames in the cave, because it's it's more recognizable to me, it's not scary, and it has these things that are understood properly as generated by capitalism become independent. and become real, and I don't see any way that there is a unified working class movement that operates under those assumptions that those things are real, that those things are more real anyway then than relationship to the means of production, I'm not sweating, I'm sweating a little bit, but not too bad. Ah, how are you guys doing? uh oh that reminds me the so like i said i don't know what the future is going to hold i i i do think that there is i mean inevitably going to be some formation that arises to to resist what's happening just because you know people people get bet up there's no guarantee it's going to be effective like i said and there's guarantee that the uh the most hopeful combination of that is going to be the most dominant, because there's plenty of reaction and there's plenty of um sort of useless public uh uh ego driven displays to be done that and those are still going to happen, you know uh, it's a question of getting it to a critical mass uh, but think that I mean to sound boring about it, it's going to be at the workplace, it's it's going to be at the level of the workplace, and um, specifically, I think you've got a real possibility here in this coming school year with the police, with with the with the uh Trump administration insisting to reopen schools, because you cannot reopen the economy and have people not have childcare, and so but you have these the significant. back from teachers, and uh, you know, we've seen teacher militancy is is relatively high compared to other sectors of the economy, so that could be something, another thing I think could be very, is very potentially, fruitful is uh, the big box retail economies, because one, that's the closest thing in our service driven economy to a shop floor anymore, right? like obviously there is still manufacturing done in this country, but it is largely a service economy, and retail big boxes are the closest thing to to a shop floor in the sense that you've got a a huge number of people who work near one another uh which is very much not the case in most other service industry. uh environments and also there are crucial nodes in the distribution network, they're they're they're critical to our just in time delivery process, so they fit a lot of the potential um um oh, and i would add to that obvious obviously Amazon fulfillment centers, i mean they're not technically retail, but they are part of the service industry and they also have that factory element. that shop floor element uh and you're seeing militancy at all those places and if there is any kind of coordination at that level then I think you might have the seeds for something that could become a genuine point of uh escalating conflict with the existing order uh and that's why I think if you work in a big box store you should obviously not get fired by for talking about unions. but you should be aware, you should keep your head up, you should have your antenna ping about the possibilities for labor organizing there, uh, if you don't have a job and you need one and they're hiring, I mean that's a place where you could actually work, I mean obviously work sucks and nobody wants to do it, but if you need to do it uh, you could do it in a place where politics could also be part of your daily. life in your in your in your uh employment, which most people don't have, and those are the kind of things that clarify the stakes, that raise awareness of the possibility of effective action, and most importantly could decenter the ego. so there are there are existing nodes of potential resistance uh, but they're not where we think they are, they're sure shit not having anything to do with cancel culture, uh, and until the uh, I mean, until the police reform or abolition movement has a organizational backbone to it, it's not going to be there either, uh, like, I've seen a lot of people insist that... uh that the protests a bit effective because public opinion is changing, but what good, what use is public opinion if nobody has anything to do with their views, like especially, i mean for one thing, when you say uh, you know, x number of people are now in favor of what, police abolition or whatever you want to call it, i doubt that you could get those people in a room and have them agre upon what they mean by those terms for one thing, and secondly, even if they did, uh, they wouldn't have anything to do, what, vote for democrats, is that is that the hope, they're going to vote for Joe Biden, I mean, I'm not saying that those that the movement should stop or anything, or that people should, if there's if there's a protest not go to one, I mean, I'm still going, but there has to be an awareness that organizational capacity has to be the the priority, because absent that it all just it's just a cup of water getting poured out onto a fucking concrete, it's just it's energy wasted, and if you're seeing like uh, there there are concessions being made, you know b by different municipal police departments and that's good, but It's also a moment to stop and think, well who's still in charge, you know, and who's and if if the people in charge are mallifying you, if the people in charge feel like they have diffuse detention with with their uh reforms, then they're just going to end up uh being recaptured by the systems of of coersion. and the thing is like some cities are doing stuff like Seattle apparently is saying they're going to cut a bunch of their cops, but I mean you have to, it's weird how people simultaneously will you know be say, we're we're demanding radical action, we're we're we're insisting on abolition, not reform, blah blah blah, and and and because we understand we're dealing now, but the nature of pressure is that unless it's organized to be systemic, it goes away, momentum dissipates, it's like amazon saying we're not going to sell facial recognition software to the cops for one year, and you could say the same thing about a lot of these budgets cuts and reforms, unless unless the actual structure of incentives for... political order changes or the actual political order itself is overthrown, these all these reforms will then be will have their holes filled with uh with more coersion and more exploitation, because that's all the system is. I love to fill my reform holes. It's great, all reform holes filled. the wayfare thing uh is very funny because it just shows in my opinion just the the the destabilizing nature of online, i mean this thing started on tiktok right with teenager. and they saw some kids saw like look these are really expensive and and look they have the names of this and they just went oh they're shipping them in these containers now that's insane that's an insane thing to even think for a second i mean it could happen but there are so many levels of analysis you would have to do to make that the most likely outcome like you know so many different uh you'd have to use you'd have to use fucking use Akkam's razor until it was a fucking nub to get to yeah, no, they're shipping people in uh very expensive cupbords named after the people, the kids who are in them, but the instantaneity, the instantaneousness of twitter means that that that those are or the internet in general means that those questions are never asked, there is just a thing that's happening now, and then you respond to the thing that's happening, you don't have time to think about it, and more importantly, you have no way to investigate it, because how are you supposed to trust any? how are you supposed to trust what anyone is saying about anything uh and so you it basically comes down to are you psychially in a position to absorb the thing in front of you? are you positioned culturally to when a a conspiracy is presented to you to just say okay that's true and if you are that's the end you're done uh i don't know what the deal is with the way fair thing i mean maybe it is what they say it is just like i said i would need a hell of a lot, i need to go through a hell of a lot of theories and disprove those before i got to that one, and the one i keep seeing is people saying it's just algorithmic uh it's it's it's an algorithmic website and i think there's something to that i think that's also part of all those weird remember those weird uh uh videos that were on youtube for kids of like peppa pig getting her teeth pulled out or something and everyone's freaking out about how it's like some sort of cult programming operation and maybe part of it is but a lot of it is is those things are all made by computer. and most of the user computers, the most the bots are watching videos made by algorithms and humans are literally getting squeezed out of the internet and we're just watching computers interact with each other, watching machine learning take place in front of us, and of course that's terrifying and alienating, and it also leads us to project, human shapes and structures and narratives to things like looking at a cloud and seeing a chariot. because the thing about like because think about all the the things being named after uh people who'd been abducted first of all, why would you you wouldn't do that, you wouldn't do that, i mean it just basic obsec you wouldn't do that, secondly uh apparently that that those names and shit are just because they're scraping the internet for fucking terms to put on things, they're just scraping and so... hey, wait a minute, here's a girl got abducted and here's a name for her, that must be mean she's in there, first glance that makes sense, but it's it's just as much uh, that process of of putting... on a human skin to a essentially random uh arrangement of of information uh that that happens all the time and is only going to happen more and more and more as we are observing less and less and less actual human content. i do like that apparently one of the queue people actually bought one of the cabinets which i i really. "i really can't wait to find out what happens there, i i hope, i mean i'm sure they will keep people in the loop, what else, why else would you do it if not for posts, but i really want to know what happens, if there's a kid in there, well, i will admit I was wrong. in other, someone says in other words, we're going to go insane, i mean going to go, that's actually, you could say that that's uh optimistic to." we're going to go, because I think a case could be made that functionally we no longer relate to the real world, which would make us by some definitions all of us insane, when you consider the degree to which we we live in an abstracted symbolic order compared to the amount of time we spent wrangling with the real that you could say, not the real with the capital r, not the laconian real, like material reality, the kind that has been the the domain of humans since the beginning of human existence, and now we are living purely or largely a symbolic abstraction level where we glide between ideas effortlessly and frictionlessly and are never forced to apply the the the the the um the late of like material reality to them, other people's opinions, just time and space as constraint. they were able to do unconstrained association between symbols and symbolic orders and we do that more than we do anything else, i mean maybe that that's just technologically induced schizophrenia, and that's another thing, honestly though, i think that's another thing that's pushing us to the... order of of radical ego satisfaction in a fully simulated reality in which material conditions are collapsing in front of us, it's just not sustainable, and obviously you can say that forever and then die having never seen the moment friction break happen, and that could happen, this thing could lep on for who knows how long, but it won't. forever, and I think the way to go through a day, knowing that, and not get too depressed and too hopeless, is to know that we'll get there eventually at some point, and if we don't, how are you going to ever know? how are any of us ever going to know? none of us are going to see socialism in our lifetimes. so that mean, but we still have to live our lives, and that's where destroying that ego part, because I think a lot of the thing that makes people so miserable about politics is that that horror of knowing they're never going to probably ever see anything you be better, they're never going to experience things being better, they're never going to actually get to live the life of a post-capitalist uh subject, and that is a bummer uh, but at the... same time it's irrelevant because you still you're still here, we're all still here and we have to live every day, and I think the degree to which we live it for each other, and not live it for a personal gratification, is the degree that we can handle that. Total ego death, yeah. we got to do that, we got we got to do it, but the thing is you can't tell people to do it, and that's why like all the tradcaths and people think we just need to like reinforce christianity as as as a hegemmonic uh uh spirituality or something are absurd, it's it's putting the toothpaste back in the tube, it's going to have to be a new thing, it's going to have to synthesize the concepts of pluralism and science and all all of the all of the... realities that permeate our relationships to one another, you cannot, if you turn this into some sort of matthew Walter Catholic theocracy, people are going to be fucking miserable. even the catholics, I mean, my god, the catholics, the countries in Europe, for example that had the most hejamonic catholicism, the ones where they didn't have a bunch of immigrants showing up and messing things up, they didn't have um, they didn't have Hollywood triple parentheses using their cultural marxism on people, uh, then none of them believe in God, Ireland, until like 20 years ago, Ireland was a theocratic plantation, it was a priest ruled bog, and now none of those fucking people believe a god. "you cannot impose it, it has to rise organically from people coming to an awareness and then seeing that awareness reaffirmed in their relationships to each other, because the market is is, the market is is its tendrels are everywhere, and it's the thing that guarantees that your your precious little tradcaf concept. will be overwhelmed unless you abolish uh the the market relationship, and guess what, you cannot do that from a sectarian perspective, catholic sectarians aren't going to overthrow capitalism, white nationalists aren't going to overthrow capitalism, because you need the you need the people, numbers are the only thing, capital has everything else, they have our fucking brains in the form of our our value system, they have the information networks, they have the... the capital, they have, they have the military, they have the police, all we have are numbers, and any movement that says, we're going to get there by radically proscribing through morality or skin color or ethnicity, is doomed, because you will eventually have to make a make a devil's bargain with capitalism, because it cannot be defeated by a sect. I do think they should nationalize passive income, absolutely nation or uh nationalize passive income and also uh this is one thing I agree with pachooning about abolish inheritance. The beauty thing is is you could actually do like a judo flip on libertarians of course it won't matter because they don't really believe what they say they believe, but if you wanted to just win an argument. with the libertarian, you could point out that all the things they say about about the market relationship, the equal relationship that exists between an employer and employee, how it's it's a fair, it's a fair negotiation between selling labor powered buying it, all other perceptions only exist without concentrated wealth and debt more than anything determining the power structure within those negotiations, the only way to prevent that is to mow the lawn every generation every every new uh group of people, you don't not get your dad's fucking money or your mom's money, you don't get it, no debt and no wealth accumulated, you can accumulate and i mean obviously there's a difference between reform and abolishing capitalism, but uh, if you even wanted to make capitalism even vaguely use, vaguely akin to its um... theoretical function, you would have to abolish those things, and the fact that that's that's absurd, the fact that those things that would actually make capitalism work, are essentially not biable, getting rid of passive income, yeah that'l work, they're going to stop that, uh, getting rid of inheritance, the fact that those are non-negotiable means the capitalism has to be overthrown. someone says uh, if you're going to be buddhist, doesn't that mean fuck it? no, it doesn't, because if you aren't living for yourself, you're living for other people, you're living, you're living, you're living, loving kindness for all, and in my mind anyway, that means creating the conditions for everyone. to reach that point, and you cannot, if you are deprived, if you lived a deprived existence, you will probably, it will be very difficult for you, especially in a western context, to ever even occurred to you to, to abolish the ego or desire, because you've never had it fulfilled, and you spend your life seeking and craving and and striving and being thwarted and then building your personality around your inability to have your desires fulfilled. and then of course there are the people the rich people who get their desires filled and when they do that drives that their miserable as well, that drives them to a different sort of misery, it's obviously more. terrible uh, but it is, it's the same spiritual deadness, and the only way that any of that is going to be overcome is if you make so that rich people aren't able to get everything they want, and uh, poor people are able to get enough to fucking take a breath, take a fucking breath and look around. uh what books am i reading? i've got um, i just got an advanced. and it's basically he's clearly setting up it's about the Carter administration uh and I think that that is I'm excited because that's such an under studied era and under talked about era I think because Carter really was the guyified the bipartisan neoliberal consensus before Reagan Reagan was the kind of the capstone on it, and one thing I think is really interesting is that Pearlsteen talks in early parts of the book about how uh, you know, Carter came into office, he won their election closer than people thought it was going to be, but he came in with a with a comfortable super majority in the house and senate uh, and almost immediately ran into ground because the conservative movement, which a lot of people a lot of liberals thought was dead after uh Forb lost, and after... Reagan was defeated at the convention before that uh was were able to rally resistance to carter along the axis of social issues uh gay gay marriage or gay rights and um and the era and things like that and what I think is so funny is that you you read that and you you read these these guys who use those social discontents to power Regan into the White House and none of that stuff has stopped none of... things that they fought for, none of the social change that they wanted to prevent has stopped, it keep going uh, because Reagan never really gave a shit about it, and none of the, none of the actual um functionaries of government really care about social issues, because that's not what their job is, their job is to maintain capital uh flows and capital capitalist control, uh, and more importantly, they don't have power to change that. those are all cultural responses to change in material condition, which is why fixating on culture from either end of it is futile because it doesn't reach down, it comes up from, you're pushing against the current, but anyway i'm looking forward to reading more of it, it's pretty good. It's been a while since I've read any science fiction, I'm thinking of uh finally reading Jean Wolf, a lot of people have been recommending Jene Wolf to me and I've never read him before, so uh, I might check it out after I finish Nixonland, or Ragon Land rather, it's also true of Democrats too, it's true of both party. they don't really care, I mean it democrats get to get credit or blame for the fact that that uh social liberalism keeps uh accelerating, but it's not because of them, it's not because of the republicans uh, it's it's because of the social uh, social base, it's atomization of the social base, and the thing is that part of that is good, because the the the traditionalism of the pre-70s era was too staltifying, and it had to be rearranged, still needs to be rearranged, and that's why I can't accept any notion of traditionalism is some sort of uh uh banner because it's sorry, it's und dialectical, like these these these relationships have changed and we have to deal with the fact that they're different now, now that doesn't mean that you uh, the thing is though, that doesn't mean that you create litmus tests and you say if you're not if you're if you're not fully on board with the... of - if you haven't like passed the gauntlet of wokeness then you're not in the club, i don't think that that's the answer, and the thing is, i don't think most people care about that that much, that people of good faith anyway, uh, i think there's a boogy man built up, like how many people are obsessed with like keeping tucker carlson out of the left, who the fuck is actually saying he should be in the left, is there anyone actually talking about that, and more importantly, even if they were, who gives a shit, because there's no like the idea a alliance with like the populist right, there is no populist right either, there's just like there's no left, there's no anybody, there's just people, and and you're talking about leaders, have tv shows or politicians, they don't speak for anyone, they're not connected to any kind of uh organization that can that can bring people in, you can only say maybe the people who they like will like me now, and it's just it's it's it's coke and pepsi shit, it's branding because there's no structure. Yeah, people don't care about this stuff, it's all Hothouse fantasy, because people want to fight, they want to slay demons uh online, either, either, either uh, are either woke the the woke uh PMC uh propagandists or the the the stras rights, and and that's fun doing that, it's slipidly satisfying, but it doesn't do anything, because these people don't ' anyone, no one represents anybody but themselves, and that's why I think that whatever is coming is going to have to come with a radical break, because of how exhausted and um, uh stailmated everything is at the rhetorical level yeah that's right look at me drinking glass water with one hand. spicy, i like spicy mustard, i also like brown mustard on the on the broad honestly, the i like the the thick grain mustard best of all, stone ground, that's the stuff, really good for a broad, rich, ooh, the American Tabloid movie dreamcasting, that's tough, somebody said joe barinthall could be pee bonderant, i think i could buy that, i don't ever seems like a pipsqueek now, all actors are like, they're just little, they're little guys, I don't buy any of them as any of those dudes, do I realize the 90% of what I'm saying applies to France, it applies to every western every country to some extent because it's all part of... market, but but more intensely in places where capitalism has been uh been hegemonic longer, so us most of all, because we're the lead, we're the we're the bleeding edge of it, uh, but also of course uh, of course france, and of course uh, france more than any most other people in uh Europe, because as I said, France is the America of Europe. you know it's asschup wow we got the trolls out in force today someone bad mouthing hence ketchup the ideal condiment wow sad Finding out there are people who don't like hence ketchup that's a shocker but you know what taste is subjective and it doesn't really matter so everyone can enjoy their inferior catchups more hinds for me uh France is like the US and someone asks is it because they think people love them honestly yeah that's a big part of it, it's the thing that I think is American about France is just the the the nazating self-regard of their culture, which I think that's why we're not. hey even though we're we're anglophone because the british are self-loathing and we are not uh same thing with the french they love themselves and they love their country and they think that they they think they invented democracy we think we did uh both of us think that's like we could look around now and act like that's anything to fucking celebrate um yeah yeah they are nationalist in a very similar way that we are, even if of course ours is much more violent and that's that's the frontieer baby, that's the that's that free real estate, that's that's the seller colonial part, which france doesn't have as much of. all right, this is the last thing i'm going to say before i wrap up, someone's asking about and this is the the this is the sad scary thing is that somebody asks, do i think that you know as things get worse, revolution's going to be inevitable, and i got to say not at all, because there's i think of faith that a lot of people have and I think that undergards a lot of assumptions, and I have I feel this way sometimes too, and I got to catch myself, that as things get worse, people are going to come to some sort of realization about the system they live under, but I don't think there's any reason to assume that that's going to happen absent the social conditions that like, the marxist conception of class consciousness arising is that people compare notes, like people people on in a factory or in a working class neighborhood, they have... they have a common experience of exploitation that they can discuss, they have a social relationship to one another that leads them to a realization. we all are siloed off in our individual mind units, with our personally curated feeds and algorithmically generated content that give us individualized responses to our lives, including it their conditions and their immiserations, and that leads us to a lot of bad conclusions like they're shipping children in the mail in giant cabinets. and when things get worse, there's no guarantee that uh, that we're going to change that heuristic, we're only probably going to double down on it, because nothing's intervening with us to make us not think that this is the way things are, that our explanation for reality is not the correct one, that's that social dimension that makes that happen, and that's why I'm saying, the hope is into things like teacher strike or big box retail, I think is a real big one, Amazon headquarters, buse to this day nothing has placed and in fact everything is only displaced and made worse, the the uh radicalizing, empowering, positive feedback loop of of the workplace as center of of social uh conflict and radicalization, and i know that that sucks because people are all working temp jobs where they don't even see a coworker all day, or they're working from home, or they don't have a job at all. and that's a huge huge percentage of the population, and the question is, well, what about me? uh, and that's a hard one to answer, the hope is that enough of those people, enough people who don't have a social relationship to labor, uh, that they can see people who do and get the and take the right uh lessons from that, take uh, and that's that's. where the dice get rolled, that that's where that's where we enter the multiverse and uh we find out which which timeline were in and i don't know, i don't know, got the shrug going, but all we can do in the meantime is keep our powder dry, so dry up your powder everybody, dry up your fucking powder, bye-bye.
