 Baby, here I am, man, the canals and the bridges, the embankments and cuts, they blasted and dug with their sweat and their guts, they never drank water, but whiskey by pints, and their shanty towns rang with their songs and their fights, navigator, navigator, rise up and be strong, the morning is here and there's work to be done, take it tick and your shovel and them all dynamite where to shift a few tons of the searly delight, yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight, hey folks, sorry about Wednesday, uh, I was not in a place where I could get very good wi-fi, so it wasn't been feasible to stream, but I definitely even if I can't. two streams a week, i want to at least do the book club every week, the vibe stream, maybe not every week, uh, like i don't know about next week, i do want to do more with Chris though, uh, i want to do the one i last weeks with chris i thought was really fun, and i honestly prefer that to just like trying to read the comments cuz honestly they're hard to follow and not a lot of them are great, i got to tell you guys, a lot of bad comments, a lot of so it's hard to parse the good ones from the bad ones, much funner to do. with Chris, so uh, I'm going to try to make that like maybe every other week cuz I don't want him to feel like he has to do it every week, but anyway, one thing I want to do every week is do the damn book club, so let's just start off very quickly uh with chapter two of reconstruction by Eric Fanner so. One thing that um Fanner really lays out when he's breaking down the social order that is emerging and the social conflicts that are emerging in these in the southern states specifically is among the different populations who are ready to accept union uh victory and accept uh federal authority being reimposed. there is a consistent um pattern whereby any group will sell out basically the the uh the interest of any other group that they do not feel that they are part of so like the white southern unionists for the most part are perfectly happy to say the union one slavery is abolished but that their rights need to be in some sense uh uh over held over the rights of the freets of the newly freeed slaves, but it's important to note, this was not simply a mechanism of racial discrimination by itself. Fanner points out that the uh relatively prosperous, free colored population, as was known then, of New Orleans was also perfectly willing to sell out the... of former slaves in exchange for being sort of uh affirmed at the top of a social hierarchy uh and it is important to remember and something that i think gets lost in a lot of the um the talk the uh way that we frame civil rights and the way that we frame um like the virtue of citizenship is one of the things that's like uh does make uh like the a black American population seem to stand in for sort of like the virtuous, the most virtuous of us, as in the people in the United States who have benefited the least at the expense of others, a lot of that bles down to the fact that they didn't have anybody to sell out, there was nobody that they could have tried to negotiate against and sack. now what that means though is that as a result the black experience of America is one that has with it like an actual a a enduring solidarity that transcends class that there is something like a black destiny or or black rights that need to be considered by people even if they might not even if you're doing better than other members of that group uh economically, there's still a um an obligation there, which is one of the big reasons that you know black people when they do vote, vote overwhelmingly democratic. regardless of what their economic um position is, but it's not because people are better, it's not e that the culture they create is more virtuous, it's because there is nowhere else to go, and one of the reasons I think that America is such a monsterous country in its history, and and why it's has become the country that has sort of... remade the world in its image is because thanks to proscribed the existence of proscribed classes like blacks and uh land that could be endlessly excorporated from native Americans meant that social solidarity was essentially never never needed to be was never forced into being through conflict because it could always social conflict by those among those who are part of the police could always be offloaded somewhere else, onto somebody else, first racial minorities in the United States itself, and then later foreigners elsewhere, and now we're in a situation where the the frontier is closed, the myth is over as Greg Grand has pointed out, and we don't know how to be social, we don't not know how to uh accept the idea that there is fucking obligation to other people the trans sends our individual interest, because American history has essentially been able to avoid dealing with that question at every point by sacrificing the interests of somebody else somewhere else or someone who looks some different way, and that can't happen anymore, and now we don't know what to do, and we're having a gigantic uh nationwide nervous breakdown out of that. now the reason that I think looking at reconstruction and looking at a different reconstruction that might have happened and the actual materials that were in play, is that if cuz is that by accepting and and teasing out the notion of a uh of an alternative of a country that does come to terms with obligations and social solidarity and what it means to be you know uh a citizen beyond just personal autonomy at all costs. uh that we had the up we could have done it, because to say otherwise is just to say that essentially is to take that the the the pessimistic like the doom approach that well we were tainted because we had this land and because we had these racial categories, we were doomed from the beginning. well if that's the case then why do anything, why care about politics? why focus on any of this stuff unless it's honestly? a way for people who are relatively comfortable to uh accept that, to to stop feeling guilty about it, to say essentially, you know what, I wish we were in a country where that had some sort of social obligatory structures and I wish that that there was humanity to our interactions and it wasn't just cold blooded uh calculation, but that darn racism, those darn, it's what are we going to do, oh well, what are you going to do about it? i i i guess i i can feel a little bad that i ended up at the top of this uh situation, but there's nothing i can do about it, so uh, i can blame racists in the past and racists in the present, none of whom are me, and that really does let us all off the hook, i mean all kinds any kind of black pill you want to take, any kind of doom-based politics you want to take, whether it's whether it's a a progressive one that emphasize. America's racism or a super racist one that says that because we have uh uh um multicultural society we can't have anything good that's all just a way to avoid the obligations of being a human a human and the obligations we have to each other that transcend any of these fucking uh political arguments or our narrow understanding of fucking history which is never a real conception it is always a story we tell ourselves we can all tell ourselves any story, there's no answer here, there is no true thing that we can drill out of our past, we can notice patterns and recognize patterns and try to recognize patterns when they emerge around us, but there is no facts, there is no fundamental thing that we can take from these, there are only stories we can tell ourselves, and i am trying to tell a story that leaves the aperture of possibility open for for change. because to do otherwise is to is to abnate your is to abdicate your responsibility as a human. so in this chapter fanner also talks about the reconstruction governments of the war years, because reconstruction is thought to have begun in 1865, but the union held huge chunks of southern territory through military occupation, starting in 1862 and then expanding over the course of the war, so uh there were essentially like reconstructed governments already being built before the war. and he goes through them, they were in Tennessee, uh, Maryland, Kentucky, and Louisiana, those are the ones he focuses on, and what happened in most of these was a miniature version of what the civil war was in general, which was an overthrow of a quasai aristocratic, quasi feudal planter elite by smallholders and and the emergent urban merchant class, the bourgeois revolution. the continuation and the fulfillment of the bourjois revolution that began with the American revolution, but which was essentially uh arrested by the creation of the constitutional order, and what's interesting is is when you look at the record of uh Andrew Johnson as a military appointed governor of Tennessee during the war, he looks like a progressive, he looked like a man who had been uh fundamentally altered by experience of the war who who was noted for his stern hand to rebels, to his uh his vehement prosecution of of traitors and eventually to his sort of open-handed treatment of former slaves. uh, but what's really important to note though is what was propelling this from Johnson was the resentment of slave owners felt by a guy who at the end of the day was a quasii illiterated Taylor and who had never been accepted and never could be accepted by the the the best parts of Tennessee society and had with him sort of a nixonian grudge, and that's what powered his politics, that's what made him a unionist during the war, that's what powered him towards uh suppressive uh, the suppression of uh the pro secession faction in Tennessee, but then once he becomes president and his and uh his resentment goes from uh a planter elite that is now dethroned to the new ruling class of Washington DC, radical Republicans, that resentment goes uh, that powers him, and now powers him in a different direction towards uh, reathroning all the people he used to hate, in his mind for the good of the poor whites, but in reality for the reinscribement of all of the most reactionary quasi feudal elements of... and the other thing uh that I think really needs to be emphasized in this second chapter is a theme that's going to be important to focus on as you go through the whole of reconstruction which is a uh push and pull between the necessities of prosecuting the war which meant confiscation of property which meant abbregation of all the liberal values that uh that the the wig the wig model that uh governed the union sides governing uh ruling class held and those very uh ideological precepts and with them the the desire especially powerfully felt by Lincoln to keep the border uh the border slave states on the union side uh I honestly think that that focus of link. is probably his biggest blind spot over the course of the war, it's understandable because obviously you don't want the border states to succeed, but once you get to the middle of the war, once you get to the like the point where military occupation of these places is already established where like Tennessee is under military oppucation, Maryland, delaware under military occupation, how Louisiana is mostly under military occupation, they don't really get a say. anymore, you don't really have to kiss their asses so much, but Lincan was operating from the same deliberative uh ideology, the same liberal orthodoxy that dominated the Republican Party, and that liberal orthodoxy is, and uh, this is a thing that Richard White talks about most more explicitly in the republic for which it stands, uh, that liberal orthodoxy is one of the big hindrances to the war, uh, to the recognition of the actual implication. also the power of the slave owners and their ability to exercise power is going to also have to be abolished, but to do that would require a reordering of the state's relationship to citizenry that was anathema to uh the center of gravity of opinion in the republican party and of course the the financial and merchant. and the thing that needs to be pointed out is that there were two things pushing against that liberal orthodoxy, one was just the exigencies of the war itself, like Benjamin Butler and Sherman and these guys who did radical stuff like confiscating slaves as band and then giving them land as as uh Sherman did when he was marching through the carolinas that they were not doing ideologically, they were done out of necessity. I need, I need bodies, I need people to uh to dig ditches and and build fortifications, why not use these people who literally are begging me to take them in, and or or Sherman, I have these people, I don't have any means to feed or take care of them, give them some land and let them farm themselves and then I can. focus on winning the war, so that's part of it, but the other thing, the other most crucial pressure that pushed uh, the war effort and and reconstruction policy passed where uh the average republican office holder was comfortable with were the slaves themselves, it was a it was a pressure from below that generated uh the real productive tension with the governing. ideology of the north and between the governing ideology worth of the north and the project of winning the war and why the war is being fought. okay, so let's go now to chapter three, which is where Fanner breaks down the different ways that um uh the ex-s slave population assert their um their rights, their and their independence from uh the the slave economy and the slave society that was uh generated by it, and fanner points out very astutely and something that I think it's overlooked a lot is that we talk about reconstruction and the end of slavery as a challenge to getting and as a challenge of getting the whites of the south and the north for. matter to be comfortable accepting black people as equal citizens, but there was a flip side to that, which is getting former slaves to seed to being part of a white ruled um political order. how the hell do you go from being the property of people, the people who prescribed three year skin color, a a a a non-human basically? status uh and then living amongst them as equals or even putative equals of any kind like just as contract freedom which is what someone how could you even imagine that you could exercise contract freedom with these people and it really does suggest that you know though the uh that with all truthers being uh had that what would have been the preferable thing at least for the former slaves would have been black self-determination, you know, I mean, I uh, the the kind of stuff that the uh communist party uh pushed for in the 1930s, self-determination for the black belt, like not just land, but political autonomy within the land that they would have had, and that's actually something that there's a book fire on the mountain that somebody. recommended to me in this chat and I read it, it's pretty interesting, it's an alternative history, which I love, book where um, John Brown's raid is successful and it sparks a rolling slave rebellion that over the course of years leads to uh general um, a generalized rebellion against slavery throughout the south and the establishment of like a free black republic in the American South, which becomes socialist. which links up with uh European socialist currents to the point where eventually by the mid-20th century, the United States itself has had a socialist revolution and is now allied with this former part of... itself, but the problem with that dream is that it was in black self-determination was essentially impossible to enforce wherever it came into conflict with the white prerogative of power, simply because there was no uh, there was no mechanism for it, the same way that the that the native Americans were essentially unable to uh effectively combat the... westward expansion of the United States, former slaves were in a similar uh uh situation where because of the fact that they had been literally deprived of everything but their lives for their entire uh existencees upon freedom the the they did not have access to the capital or the organizational forms or the that could have effectively anyway uh made an assertion of autonomy against white society they had collaborate, they were cursed to have to collaborate uh with with whites in order to gain any kind of uh self-determination, but not by themselves, and uh, what fanner points out here is that in places where white prerogative existed like labor, like this the like labor conditions and and the conditions by which labor is sold, and also the disposition of land, there was very... little that uh former slaves could do to assert their autonomy. places that they could though were uh in domesticity and uh and religious practice. uh and in with domesticity you see uh a wholesale retraction out of the labor force of uh of former slave of black women uh who were going to work at home, like was the ideal among white uh families, women were not supposed to work outside the home ideally, there was a domestic sphere, and uh, and part of black self-determination and and as the as slavery ended, was withdrawing women and children from the workforce and into a domestic uh situation. um, and of course that wasn't able to be universalized and and in many cases it was resisted by local white authorities, but it was a assertion of of autonomy. uh, there is an interesting quote though, I wanted to read from the this chapter uh where Fanner is talking about this assertion of uh of autonomy, and he says, family itself, rather than a white owner or oversear. now decided where and when black women and children would work, and I think that's an interesting sentence because it points to the way that that invisible hand of the market that of course is not invisible and is is actually the the uh, the concerted rule of of of capitalists does its most effective super. work at mystifying coersive relationships, because the family was not going to be able to decide if women and children worked, women and children might have to work if they need the money, if they need the money, they might have to have someone go out and work in the field or work domestically, they don't have that, they they they will, if they want to stay fed, have to accede to that, but they will not be forced to, they will not be. directly uh told to by a white owner or overseer, it will be just the market, it will be the fact that they don't have enough money, and so that become it's felt as a voluntary relationship, but in reality it is as coersive as the slave relationship, but because it is felt as autonomy, it is, it is dealienated in that respect, and that's one of the things that has powered, capitalism to the heights that it has is that it can generate a lot of social misery that is impossible to place the source of by people who experience it. now when it comes to labor, the assertion of black autonomy boiled down to a demand for land ownership, which is Obvious when you think about it, that was the synoquinon of freedom for all Americans, going back to the revolutionary ethos, like yoman, the yoman smallholder was the ideal citizen, someone who did not own their labor to another and could sustain themselves on their own land, and it was very, it's kind of amazing when you see the sort of bafflement and and and outrage by a lot of even northerners at the temerity of the slaves to insist upon ownership of land, when that was the fundamental expression of American liberty, the 1860 republican platform, uh was um was advertised with the slogan, vote yourself a farm, which culminated in the passage of the homestead act, but of course many backed at the idea of giving just giving the land, which of course super absurd, because the idea that this has not been worked. for the idea that this was a handout is monstrous, because these are literally people whose labor had created the wealth in the first place, if they were owed anything, it was the land itself, uh, but even more absurdly is a lot of northerners insisted that there was no authority to take the land, that that the limited prerogative of the federal government did not extend to the to abrogating land from people, but there's another quote from this: chapter um where a former slave while talking to a union officer who is uh not being enthusiastic about the idea of taking uh land because it's against it's goes beyond his authority says if you had the right to take masters slaves you had the right to take master's land too, which is obviously the case because until the civil war slaves were property. "the distinction between slaves and land, from a legal point of view, you might argue moral, but again if morality was entered into this, then that equ that equation would never have existed, was arbitrary, and that really is the entire uh role, that's the goal, that's the um, that is the reason that we have things like the constitution, and the reason that we have our political institutions is to draw arbitrary lines of power." which protect private prerogatives and protect the existing power structures and resource distributions that we have, and then call that natural. And I think, but I think it's very point, important to point out, the slay, the case for redistributing land to former slaves, was legally, as I have said, and morally, unassailable. you can't argue against it, it's on its face true, and it didn't matter, because the only thing that yields power, the only thing that makes power yield is power, and there was not sufficient organized power to assert uh uh black rights to land, beyond what in limited areas they were given almost as experiments uh or as ad-hock measures of war. but one of the big uh things that created conflict between the um the new regime, the new uh reconstruction regimes and the ex- slaves is that ex- slaves wanted to pursue a subsistence agricultural living, they wanted to grow food for their families and maybe grow enough cash crops for a little bit of folding money. what they did not want to do was spend 12 hours a day in the field to grow cotton because they'... knew through experience that that money would not go to them, which of course was true, and you actually saw uh a parade of northern duuters who went to the south to buy up plantations as experiments and have x slaves grow cotton again experimentally and then sell it as a as a way to raise their standard of living with the expectation at all points that the wion share of the profit would go to the person who had uh who had who had assumed the risk of buying the distressed plantation property and not you know the people who actually had worked the land their entire lifes and who by any measure should have profited from all of it and so the the the prerogative the the the uh the free slave desire for a subsistence livelihood was in direct conflict with the drive toward capital accumulation which had defined the... and then just end up uh the other thing that f talks about is the emergence of uh a political organization and expression on the part of uh the the black population in general and then later the former slave population uh as the as reconstruction begins uh in the immediate aftermath of the war the leadership of um uh the black population that asserted in what was what in for the most part came down to self-organized political conventions that met, voted on resolutions, demands for land, demands for rights and treatment, and then essentially set them as sent those uh resolutions as entreaties to Washington, but they had no actual legal sanction, but what they were the first attempts to organize and create a c culture that could then interact with the uh the governing culture over time and at the and the immediate aftermath of the war the vast majority of the people who showed up to those conventions and spoke and wrote the resolutions were uh were free blacks from before the war uh and ministers uh many of the teachers uh and veterans essentially those members of the black community who had some extended interaction with white institutions at some level which gave them uh the uh the tool kit basically to go to a convention and and you know organize it and and interact with the the government such now as time went on that changed though as reconstruction deepened and as uh former slaves in the upcountry and in the deep pla regions as they came to self-organize uh those conventions that convened further off from the time of the end of the war became more and more dominated by actual former plantation slaves who were learning essentially the ropes of civic engagement as as they emerged from a condition of servitude. and uh just to let wrap up uh on the third chapter uh talks about the endemic and horrifying nature of violence carried out by uh whites against former slaves all throughout the south, thousands and thousands of murders, assaults, uh, at this point, not really the linchings that we think of like the ritualized community linchings, but more essentially gorilla attacks, like attacking people in their homes or on the road, um, and what that shows more than anything was that... for reconstruction to have any success, and I think and this was something that was dawned on uh northern Readership pretty early on, uh, there would have to be a significantly punitive uh, approach to dealing with former slave owners, uh, there would have to be a continuation of violence, uh, and that reality was the one thing that Lindon John or Lindon Johnson, Johnson could not countenance, and the real disaster, more than anything of presidential reconstruction, which happened uh, after the Lincoln assassination and before the radicals reasserted control of the process, uh, was that he wanted to allow the former slave owners essentially to get off Scott free, and what they were going to do with that freedom uh, is pretty clear, which was intimidate the former slaves into a condition of of essentially de facto slavery through. horrifying uh application of violence, and this honestly for me is the thing that makes me most most believe that a second Lincoln term, a reconstruction uh under Lincoln instead of Johnson would have been fundamentally different and would have changed the trajectory, I don't know how much, but somewhere from where we ended up, because I just simply do not believe that Lincoln having fought the war the way he had and uh would have allowed or would have been um comfortable in any way with allowing that level of violence to determine the social relations in the post war South, especially when he had an entire party at his heels ready to ready and willing to affirm a putative approach to the former slave owners. uh and that is why I really want to you know do something with that idea because uh it is one of those places where like the shadow of history sort of... cast paul and and you get you just shiver and you think what could have been, but uh, but yeah, everybody, but Andrew Johnson by the end of the war, knew that there was no way that you could just wish away social conflict, in fact uh, a white former governor of North Carolina, and I'll end with this quote, uh, said in 1865, with reference to emancipation, we are at the beginning of the war, and that is the reality of... and some people were aware of that and accepting of it, others weren't, and the real tragedy of American history, one of them is that one of the people who wasn't or if he was, he didn't care, was the fucking president of the United States. Okay, so that's the overview, so we're going to do chapters four and five for next Wednesday, if anybody has wants to talk about it a little bit here, uh, I'd be happy to. someone asked would Lincoln have abolished the constitution? Lincoln loved the constitution and the problem is everybody loved the... constitution, I don't think that the constitution would have been abolished, you know, like that, I do, I do see a ability after a protracted conflict after a protracted, like essentially a second civil war, which would have happened, planters and their allies would have resisted, that the exigencies, the realities of administering this, like I said, uh, the republicans were pushed way beyond their comfort zone. in terms of uh uh abbregating authority from the constitution by the exgencies of prosecuting the war. if that war had continued to be prosecuted, not as a ground campaign with armies, but as the suppression of a gorilla movement and the standing up of a new like multiracial uh order in the south, that that process, that dynamic of the constitution sort of being pressed and and the varities that underlied it being challenged and undermined, i think that would have continued too, and then maybe even not link, but maybe maybe a sumner administration or something says, all right, let's fucking rip this fucking thing up, and really that was that would have been a necessity to affirm a a political structure for this country that would have been flex. and um flexible enough to accommodate uh subaltern demands and it would not obviously have led to some sort of peaceful uh um socialism I think that the the German example pretty clearly shows that that's not in the cards that capitalism knows where the line is and will fight. for it, but every move towards the creation of a of a genuinely multi uh racial and multi-ethnic working class means that those points of conflict become more and more uh contestable by the working class, which is the opposite of what we had in this country where at every step, every working class uh explosion has been contained and nullified over time, the most sustained one of course being in the early 30s, being contained into the the structure of the new deal and then over the course of the next 30 years uh sort of dissipated and and co-opted and neutralized, and now we are in the situation where class as a felt social uh experience no longer exists and has to be... built and anyway you slice it, the institutions that the constitution has left us with are huge hindrances to that and are eventually going to have to be directly conflicted with. to uh episode 500 will not be a clip show, there's going to be plenty of new stuff, i've not seen the new Curtis stock yet, i will though, watch it soon, how long is that fucking thing? oh man, six hours, jeepers christmas, okay, i better get, i better get cracking them. eight, wow, 10, holy Mackerel, it's it's in it actually never ends, you start watching it and you watch it forever, it's like the entertainment in infinite jest, I did watch community to the end and I did like the Yahoo season, I think the Yahoo season gets underrated, Keith David is great in it. Have I read the killer angels, who do you think you're talking to? Of course I read the killer angels, I read the killer angels when I was like 12. I even went to uh, I saw Gettiesberg in the theater, it was a little kid, and most brutally I saw gods and generals in theater, which is genuinely the worst movie I've ever paid to see and I watched the whole fucking three hours, ooh. that movie is dog shit and what's beautiful about it is yes it is noxious confederate apologia but it is also a terrible movie just from the point of view of of film-making it sucks and the funniest thing about it is that like with most civil war movies it saves money with its battle scenes by just having reinactors do it they just say hey you freaks who already own your own uh period detail accurate guns and uniforms you guys come and do a battle and we'll film it, well the thing is, the the problem is the average confeder American uh war civil war reinactor is like a 45 year old like carpet salesman who's got like a gut like a fucking michelin tire around his neck around his stomach and then you watch these shows and you watch these battle scenes and you just see these round ass guys like eating mine balls in and it's that's not the civil war the civil war was like 90 pound 18-year-olds each other, but there is a scene where uh where former senator George Allen from Virginia and a bunch of other guys play dress up as confederate generals and sing along to uh the bonnie blue flag that is a genuinely surreal and hilarious moment uh very just classic kitch. I was in Vegas this time last year, time certainly flies or does it, I don't know, it's been like one long day, but also... 500 years. Oh some! also asked me a question on twitter that I thought would be a good uh thing to to answer here because it is an interesting question somebody said they want to know what is what would be was there a European uh equivalent of the 1905 revolution and yeah it's the 1848 revolutions and the fact that they happened in 1848 and it happened in 1905 in Russia tells you really all you need to know which is Russia was way way behind Europe. and and by the time it had its uh, it's first stirrings of of like a social ferment away from uh, it's so the the social firment that comes from the impos imposition of capitalism into a feudal system, that's what the uh 1848 revolution was, and by that point in Russia you literally still had inslay uh land, land held like baron held surfs in Russia, you did they had they had a surf them that was uh more uh like in more embedded and and and uh and immovable than surfdom had been in continental Europe for in some cases hundreds of years, and so they didn't get there. they didn't get their first like explosion of that until 1905. i have read late victorian holocaust by mike davis, great book. why does everyone think Carter was so great? if anybody thinks Carter is great, it's got to be, there's the only people i can. people think Carter is great are people who like that he his post-presidential career, which I think is largely commendable, people who like the fact that some American president has called Israeli uh occupation apartide, which also commendable, if you liked his presidentc though, it's either because you're just a contrarian, who wants to stand up for somebody who was sort of unfairly maligned uh, and honestly he was unfairly maligned for a lot of the stuff the people people blamed him for publicly like the hostage crisis, although you know they didn't have to fucking give the shaah uh sanctuary and let him go and do get his cancer treatment uh, but i think a lot of the people like it like it because like him because they feel like he was honest with the American people in a way that like Reagan wasn't and that he was punished for being honest, and that is just that's perfect liberalism because of course Carter was telling the American people stop being materialistic, stop, stop measuring freedom by what you can buy and what you can spend, without giving any indication that he was going to change the underlying economic engine of this country, which depended on that, he just wanted you to feel bad, he wanted you to to to have a little uh hall monitor your head to to judge you for your uh for your desires while still living in a society completely dominated by consumerism and more than anything that's just bad politics and of course it got completely rinsed by Reagan saying now we'll cut taxes and everybody can keep party. I mean that's the thing, it's like Carter was partly human, Carter, I don't think is a real reptile, but he was a real liberal, he was a real ideologically committed liberal, and that is, that makes you an enemy to. to the human race, even if you don't know that you are, even if you think you are, that's one of the beauties of liberalism is it can convince anybody that they are doing things for everyone's good, when in fact they're just reinforcing and protecting the system from uh from uh it's from the downward pressers from pressures from below and of course he had a very bad foreign policy, i mean he fucking... sent uh money to the muujidin before the Soviets even invaded in order and part to trigger an invasion. what was the this is interesting somebody says what was the deal classical when was the decade classical liberalism stopped being progressive uh it was about the time that the term progressive was discus was uh coined the eight the late 1800s uh it's important to note that this it's the the people who have been progressives since the turn of the century the the the tier of people who are in in uh that middle tier of... academics, politicians, managers, lawyers, professional managerial types, uh, they were in the 19th century, they had a strict adherance to uh, small government orthodoxy, hard money, uh, and uh, a survival of the fittest social doctrines and what happened over time is that that went from being a uh the most humane way to organize a government because it's opposed monarchy, concentrated power and slavery, buse the the anti-slavery forces in the north, the the the northern wigs who are opposed to slavery did so through because they believed it was morally wrong to for anyone to be compelled to labor by anything other than the market, the market should be what compels you to labor, not everybody, of course that doesn't stand for every abolitionist, wendle phillips for example, john brown for that matter didn't think that, but that was the pervading orthodox. it was the most humane way to organize capitalism, but by the end of the guilded age that system would broken down, and the new people who came to that social or came to those social positions, it's not the same people, remember, they're dying out, and they're being replaced by new people, and the new ones they're replaced by, have they find that that orthodoxy doesn't work anymore, and their new understanding of the most humane way to organize capitalism is through the uh mix. economy, uh, social safety net, welfare, the the things that become the progressive model that has dominated ever since, but it's the same social strata all along, all right, and this the couple more, I'm going to go. thoughts on St. Louis, I don't really have thought any thoughts about the city, I do have some thoughts about the saint, uh, I don't know if you guys know this, but he was actually, he's a king of he was king of France, I believe the only king of... to have been sanctified or beodified uh and he uh was a very very uh earnest and and passionate crusader but also a very bad one uh he did a couple of crusades that were uh complete botches and he actually died on campaign in Africa uh of dysentary shitting his dudo house out in a camp and then they made him a saint for that. Why do I hate the English? They're the one, I mean I don't hate the English like as people, but like English civilization, those are the guys, their combination of uh technology and bureaucracy, and when I say technology, I mean things like protestantism and uh, and uh, you know, uh, their naval, naval stores and shit like that, uh, double entry. whatever that they whatever bundle of things they came together, not only gave them a technological spear sort of to to use in the in the battle for world resources, but it also generated a culture of bureaucracy that allowed them to carry out monstrous acts of colonial domination while maintaining a civil veneneer and a uh functioning um political culture in the metropol and that model is the model that all capitalism has followed ever since. we were just took the baton from them. that's why you can just give me give me a time machine and let me just honestly, i don't even have to give Napoleon like a modern navy cuz what would they know they would know how to do with it. just give them some fucking catchup packets, give the french some fucking catchup packets so that the... can go out in out on the sea and not have to worry about getting scurvy, just give them some fucking barrels of catchup packets to just go out and then they put ketchup on their food and then they don't have to worry about their teeth falling out and this dumb limis have to fucking you know they have to turn back because they ran out of produce and they're all they got all got giant uh bruises from their fricking scurvy because that the bureaucratic culture the that that alienation that is central to English social order and that we then transmogrified into like a mad dog settler colonial version of it has has rendered meaning, has destroyed any meaning beyond that which can be quantified, has destroyed social meaning, has destroyed the soul, and we're all now living in this desanctified, soulless universe that these fucking limis created. but again that's not the fault of English people now, although a lot of them do seem to be very genuinely miserable and more than anything sad that they are fucking empires and still around, which is how is that like people like people are often horrified by the turks for not recognizing the Armenian genocide, which they should be, or for the Japanese for acting like they didn't do anything wrong in Mancheria, but look at the English whining, crying that their empire is gone, when the fact is that... for the crimes their empire committed, they should have just had the entire island detonated and sunk into the north sea, they got to keep their shit, they got to keep the elgen marbles and they're going to wine and complain that they don't have the empire anymore, the fucking gall, all right, i think that uh, i think bertovo is going to be streaming uh fortnite pretty soon, so i'm going to log off uh, hopefully godwill in the creek don't ride. Wednesday we will be talking about chapters four and five four five of reconstruction. Bye-bye.
