 losing again, god damn i got a colic, hair is all over the place, at this point i'm getting to a situation where i've got this fitting promotory in the front that is separating like the burm here from this lake of lava in the back, and i'm basically okay with my hair as it is, like this is essentially like mid-80s nicholson and i like it, you know, i think he looked like a goddamn pimp and fucking shining and shit like that. that witches of eastwick, come on, uh, he was absolute king, but I'm just worried if it keeps going, the peninsulas, the the fucking itth is going to wear away, it's going to be some fucking global warming ass uh sea level rise, and then I'm in the castanza zone in which I get sides, which I just don't know if I can handle sides, I mean I'll have to, if I have to, you know, you have to, you, you, you handle whatever happens, you know, but it is uh, not something. not something that i have yet been able to accommodate myself to, hopefully if it happens it will give me, i'll have enough time to say goodbye before i end up with sides, not shaving it, can't shave it, can't do it, can't do it, can't pull the trigger on it, just it's a look, it's a general vibe and look that i don't uh really find convivial, i don't know, i wouldn't feel like it was me. and I do feel like there's something uh I think there's people say like you know hey say fuck it cut it but it's like well isn't fuck it letting it go like the real fuck it answer is just leaving it there cuz it's more hassle to keep it that close you got to cut your hair more often why if you're saying fuck it then the real fuck it's just letting it go which is what I'm going to be doing one way or the other so if I get the sides then i at the sides, and then I will be a sides king, oh god damn it, the fucking volume again, this is really getting annoying, I maybe I need a new phone, I do need a new phone, but I haven't uh gotten one yet, trying to fuck, all right, I'm going to try to see if buse, a lot of it is getting this thing to connect, cuz if it actually. is connected, shut up, everyone be quiet, all right, i'm giving up, i guess i got to use the fucking mic. the reason i don't want to do this is because people watch on youtube say that if it's not connected to the computer, it's really soft there and it sounds better with the microphone, but the microphone isn't or i mean uh, it sounds better with this than with the microphone, but if i do it with with this, everyone gives me the business while i want to do. in the stream and that is of course more distracting because it's right there as opposed to some youtube comments. oh god, i really, what is wrong with everyone? why is everyone? why can't people have a common experiential like framework so that they have when they say fine, it means the same thing to everybody? can we get some sort of uh denote some sort of connotative esperanto? because i don't get how some... people can say it's fine and some people are like it's terrible, it's the same thing. all right, how are we able to have a functioning society with like agreed upon rules that we could all like follow some sort of rule of law or uh scientific pursuit or engineering, if if there's that much difference in people's experience of the same goddamn phenomenon. how can things be that much uh determined by your subjective experience of it? explain this to me, so okay, this sounds good, but now the poor schmuck's listening on youtube, they can't hear it so good, so i don't know what to do, and since you guys are the ones yelling at me now, i guess i will listen to you, and that's just, you know, it's the way, it's the way that young players are always screwed in any uh, sports contracts, it's because the people who end up in leadership position. in the union are almost invariably veterans and they don't really have anything in common with younger players and so they're always happy to to underpay younger players for them to maintain. their privileges as as uh big shots and that kind of thing happened throughout all strata of of business unionism in the United States and it's one of the big reasons why when push came to shove and the crisis of capitalism happened uh within a democratic framework we there was no uh working class there to uh uh speak up for its own interests because the institutions that had been using to do that had been totally coopted. And now we live in the aftermath of that, and I think that's what I've really been trying to get my head around and what I want to express more in a written form hopefully soon is is the degree to which we really are operating from a a fundamentally different political reality than the one that governs the way most everyone assumes politics works because of the total uh removal from bipartisan political debate, all questions of macroeconomics, all questions of distribution of resources within a political framework, with that with that's gone, that changes the dynamic within politics and it removes it from the material world over time to the point where when you have something like say a 2008 economic crisis where even like the bubble fueled ricky machine they put together after the end of industrialization. in the United States, even that fell apart, it was restructured with even less allowable uh argument, now the question of hey, when the economy collapses, uh, should we just give all the money back to the people who did that and kick people out of their homes and the millions? do we want to do that? well, both political parties think we have to do that, so it's going to happen no matter what, so there's no political, there's no friction here, the political process and like our general trajectory, the thing that determines our actual faith as opposed to the short-term, ebben flow of the political fortunes of two factions within capitalism that mostly just change a distribution of of intensity of infliction of pain on one segment of the underclass or another on behalf of the same algorithm written corporate overlords. and I want to talk about the way that this works, the way that this like creates subjects who essentially are incapable of operating out of anything other than a most base narcissistic self-interest that they don't even know that's what they're operating from uh and that that dominates the way we approach politics. We have been de declassified, we know we do not process class. through lived experience or express through culture as experience, we live atomized lives as consumers, we are consumers first and foremost, and that is that, and so if that's the case, and I think it is, because we could no longer hold the fucking machinery of state anymore, like a working class is a class with in itself that works on its own behalf, a class for itself, what marks called, that's a transition, that's class, to use that analogy again and the fucking uh the thing was dead on the table and what replaced it was this uh lived experience of consumption and so that means we have to look at if we're going to look at what like the general trends are of our of our social organs of our of our destiny as as a uh nation, and then of course you know because of our central place in the world, the world around us, the world itself also, so if that's what we are now, we're consumers, how are we expressing ourselves because we can express ourselves through the language, class uh uh class struggle strikes uh pararis para like countercultural organization against the state along class access the entirety of what used to compromise working class culture in this country you know uh Harlin County USA is a good example uh that still exists but it is not coordinated it is not at the level of anything beyond like an individual uh you know industry or uh specific shop, everyone is, everyone is operating on the every man for themself principle because we are in this sense of constant crisis because we are so precarious, everyone is on a enter hook, that means everyone is forced to choose the most, basically the the the um illusion created by the total precarity of American life post-1980 is that the building is on fire, because everyone is so fucking precarious, all problems, all political questions specifically are phrased in the assumption of a burning house with very narrow time scale for survival, because everyone lives. that way when in reality these questions are the the house is fucking fine, the house is fit as a fiddle, the house could provide for everybody, but we don't think that way, and if the house is burning, who do you save? do you save the neighbor's cat or your cat? do you save the the some you know stranger who's wandering around in the in the in for some reason in the second floor or your grandmother? do you save your wife or your i mean this is? It's the lifeboat ethics and that is what what uh we live with, that's the politics we live with because of the precarity we all feel and that means that all politics are are based on this this uh grasping panic and this uh expressed this sadism as i have said the the sense that we're going down, we have to protect for us what we can, which is why democrats and republicans a line in whatever their narrowly felt economic interests are, they uh, they support them. now that means that working class people are more likely to adhere you know to the job they do there, but everybody, even if they're positioned you know in that tenuous zone we all are where we're both exploiter and exploited, the the stuff we get we're going to cleave towards and we're going to want to hold on to, and more importantly now we're going to want to punish. the people who are responsible, because if the house is burning and we're all going to die, which is the end stage after you realize you can't get anybody more out of the fucking house, who's going to pay for it, who burned it down and who's going to suffer, and that's what our politics are, because everyone is operating at the end of the day out of a political narcissism, including myself, because we are are the entirety of our idea of what the political good is is not grounded in any kind of transcendal. transcendent morality that encompasses anyone outside of ourselves, we think it is, but at the level of emotional uh truth, at the at the level where you know the things you believe go beyond believing them as words and believing them as actions, what we really driven by is what we think of as our best interests, our best material interests and because we do not live class and class is not conscious, that ends up meaning. getting mine and it creates monsters, it's creating monsters every day, it's turning us all into monsters and that's the idea to turn us all into just attenuated strings of neurons who are being forced by the algorithm of extractive capitalism to consume and uh labor at the uh request of whatever uh stimulus are stimuli or being uh uh offered, you're just there to avoid pain and experience pleasure, everything that is not forbidden is compulsory, that's the end state of life under capitalism, and we're all headed there slowly, and within and and it happens within our lifetimes, it happens in in the lifetimes of families, uh, and it's it's not like that means people are worse now, it means that the forces pulling us apart are stronger than they've ever been. It means that our expression, our cultural expression of this of our of our attempt to you, battle the tide and maintain some dignity is marked with that, it's marked with the trauma of that, and I think a way you can look at that is look at who the last two presidents were, the presidents who came in the wake of the 2008 crisis, when there was this massively unpopular bail out that no one wanted, and both part and it happened during a transition of power from one party. the other, this is still amazing to me, nobody wanted the bailout politically, like the the people, no one wanted it, and both parties got together, except for a handful of republicans who had cover to do it because they knew it was going to pass anyway, uh voted for it, and both presidential candidates running supported Bush's plan, and when Biden Obama won, he continued it. In the aftermath of that. we live we we fully inhabited a world that we've been transitioning to you know or accelerating our transition to towards the 70s obviously, but really like this was the moment of like a full liquidity of of of of the the liquid.ification of the barrier between the spectacle of entertainment and culture, as expressed by our purchases of media, like that's the sum total of what we are, right? is what we buy to watch, and because that's the residue of all the other transactions that make up life is a commodified atom, but that we can't see, except in our like anecdotal daily life, the only expressions that we can access are cultural, which is stuff we pay to observe some way or another an economy because everything has been commodified and the way we do that politically, the way we do that politic, the political expression of that consumer thing is voting, and so our there was this dynamic where our expression of our lives as as atomized consumers, composed of buying things and once while voting created this dynamic of a political superstructure. and a cultural superstructure, and what we did, where we who we voted for in in the in our acts, our symbolic uh enactment of our uh consumer choices within politics would then like set create a uh material condition that culture would respond to, and the degree to which that vote contributed to a change in anything has reduced under over time to now where the stick is not connected to anything anymore, or if it is, it's at almost a quantum level, machines are growing on, grinding on behind the scenes almost completely, all we really have is the shadow of the shadow, and that is, and that is, and that and that that has left a gap in our belief of ourselves as political actors, like this stuff's not working, and yet we still care, and that means we have and the degree, and that hole has been filled with our absorption of politics into the overall of our overall emotional response to media in general, it becomes part of our media diet. and so the expressions on the population level in the hundreds of millions of people level, the only population level you can get to where like you can really trace trends meaningfully and screen out all of the noise, you have what people watch and buy and listen to, and what people elect, and since 2008 we have had our choices and what we have done is essentially recreate. two uh archetypes of two different um groups of people divided by geography and and uh uh demographics mostly not class one of them but not in any way the determining one. uh choosing between different modes of value i guess different like a package of cultural and aesthetic and boiling down to aesthetic preferences because we're talking about is whether you're voting or you're buying something you're your... watching a channel and contributing to its ad revenue, you're purchasing a streaming service, you're downloading something, what you're doing is you are wanting to see a certain thing, a certain thing that expresses your overall cultural preferences, and I think that we can see those both in the politics and the political figures that we've exalted, specifically the presidents, because that's the biggest sample size you can find, right? that's where you're really talking big numbers and turning trying to get something out of you know the vibrating uh hornets nest of American society with its you know it's total atomization of social interaction what the fuck heard something and you look at the uh figures who emerge from our culture where you also have hundreds of millions of people contributing and this brings me to a subject that I've been talking about for a long time, I wrote an article for it embarrassingly enough now uh that I look back on it for current affairs a few years ago where I kind of scratched the surface at what I was trying to get at about prestige television and uh I think I finally getting to kind of get my head around what I've really been getting at this whole time because I think you have because what really made me real what really kicked it in for me was the realization and i think i've like known this in the back and other people might have said this, but it ne, it never really hit with me before, that Barack Obama is the prestige TV president, and that's been sitting in my head for a while and I finally figured out like what I meant by that, and now I think I understand, or at least I think I'm close to it, so I'm going to try to talk this through, so we've got our atomized pringle population, okay, in the 80s and 90s, we're reacting to the the the end of labor power in America and this new. this new world of debt, financed consumption as the American economic model, and all of the cultural implications that that has further just deepening these processes of of alienation, while at the political level, deregulation accelerates to create all this new explosions of money and everything, so the deregulator deregulatory framework that came in with Carter and Reagan broke up the... old uh calcified fordus business model of a bunch of big sectors of the American economy: finance, real estate and most, for our purposes, most importantly, broadcast media, for the before the 70s, uh, the media, the television media, what that meant was, three networks that put on shows every night to try to get as many eyeballs. possible to sell soap and beer, that's it uh, and what that meant is television was broadcast, it was try to catch a big net, and even within that, there all the attempts to uh, like narrow cast for you, like soap operas for women who are home all day, and you know, westerns for dad, and cartoons for the kitties, those are all subdemographics within a browder conceived like American suburban family, right, it was... family thing and it was the demographic was, i mean it was the demographic was made by the media itself, you know what i mean, it was it was a totalizing, obviously it uh the reflection of it was biased because of you know racial prejudice and and and all of the uh attending distortions that that brings, but the people making it were making it on behalf of what they imagine to be an American audience, and of course that was very racist assumption patriarchal and all that, that was part and parcel. the social order at the time, and you know uh, and as a result, but that's not that as bad as it was, is not what we're talking about, when we're talking about what the business model was, getting people to watch the shows as many as possible by making them appealing to as many people as possible. what that meant was television was not a challenging artistic medium, because you couldn't afford to make something that a lot of people didn't watch. It was that simple, it brought things towards the middle, like there was there were higher brow shows on TV, especially mini series, and there was low-brow stuff like heha or whatever, but there was still a sort of a a a a self-conscious sort of middle tier thing, a idea that this is a general product for a general audience, meaning like there's things below it on the entertainment scale that are more toudry like you know uh b- moviees and uh pornos maybe and like professional wrestling, and then there's things that are more uh refined like theater and books and the opera, we're right in the middle, that's where we are, like you can stay there, you can go out either way, but we're here, deregulation bloke the whole thing up and it brought a new business model in, and that was making things for people to pay for, a fee based system. now the challenge there is, well how do you get people to pay for something? thing that they get for free, and they say, well, if this is what they're looking for will go here and here. now, the easiest place to go, of course is below, obviously, because it doesn't require art, you don't have to have the perfect chemistry of people coming together to bring something that has any sort of agreed upon quality, the quality of nudity or god. head getting cut off or the word fuck is purchasable, it's quantifiable at dollars and cents, and so when HBO for example started in the 80's, called home box office, the pitch was, you can watch theatrical films in your home, and that didn't just me, buse you can see those on tv too, unedited, nudity, violence, and then when they started doing their own shows, like first in 10 and dream on, which I remember watching as a horny youngster, uh the premises essentially this is as this is as good as like a mid-tier network sitcom, but there's tits, that was the entire pitch. there was it was not high brow at all, now two things happened though in the 90s that complicate the matter, one is the internet explodes and that means the long-term uh value of pitching here to a fee based audience is going away because i can go on the internet, i can jack off, why do i need this? so where do you go? you go to quality, you go to quality, the first HBO original series was Az, and it came out in 1997, and they poached Tom Fontana from Homicide, which is one of the best procedural cop shows of the 90s in terms of critical calaim, the closest thing there was in the pre-Cacable error to a precies show, and the funny as funny as Az is on Rewatch, it's interesting because they were clearly trying to make a show that was trying to peel to a higher brow aesthetic audience. and they were doing it through the traditional uh mode of narrative artistic expression on television, which was the teleplay, like shows in the early uh uh broadcast era that were pitch towards a higher brow audience were largely things like showhouse playhouse 90 and like uh twilight zone or whatever things with set stories uh and uh and and very bounded uh dramatic uh uh very... founded um what's the word like blocking people people in rooms people in rooms and the need for and uh you know like the the the popular uh kitchen sink melodramas of the day well in the 90s by the 90s the the equivalent the theater equivalent to that the theater equivalent to you know Edward Albey or Eugene was um or Neil Simon was like experimental theater moment chance and all that shit and so... when they did tried to do that, when they tried to bring that playhouse 90 spirit to cable television, it was expressed with all the goofy physical shit with Harold pirano like talking to the screen and zipping around on a habit trail and uh and you know being splashed with paint, like that is a theatrical approach to high brow art and that was kind of a misfire and it's but it's still uh an interesting you know artifact, but what it speaks to more than anything is that... there was a recognition that if there's money to be made uh in broadcast in in fee-based entertainment, a lot of it is going to come from offering a superior product in quality. now this is early, that's calculus changes later, but while there's still this remnant monoculture, it's uh, it's quality as broadly understood by like a a educated audience who is always who you're pitching mass market entertainment to. and so when shows like the Sopranos showed up, they were meeting a new demand for people who you know were working longer hours, were more stressed, less able to afford time or money to go to the theater or read books, who are more yearning to find a easy way to distract themselves from their growing emiseration by, I don't, watching... a show uh the Sopranos and and those attendent shows and the network of uh you know recap related economies that sprung out around them were there to cotify a new standard of quality within the entertainment industry around this new uh model this is essentially this new uh business model like it was all it's the entirety of prestige TV as an ideology is just wrapped around the material reality of the fee-based cable television model uh competing with and replacing the broadcast ad based model and so that leaves us to wonder if that's what happens if it's breaking off and and bound and like uh uh being defined in opposition to like it's not TV it's HBO where what direction is it going call? "if you're doing a fee based service, by definition, you're going for the wealthier half of the people watch broadcast television, like the people who don't have money, can't afford to pay to watch shows, there's nothing you're going to be able to say to them to get them to do it, they can't afford it, as as long as there's a free alternative that offers something that to them is essentially. same thing, so that means you got to go for the upper half, that means you're going for the more educated have, you're going for almost exclusively college educated people. the people making the program for them are exclusively college educated and what do they come up with? what is this, what is this feedback loop of people paying for services, talking about the shows, the shows staying on, creating culture moving forward, ripoffs being made, an entire genre of programming being created, what do they come up with? Sopranos, breaking bad, mad men. People joked about how it's the anti-hero. It's it's this uh, it's the figure of tortured, but highly competent narcissist uh sociopathy, and there's a whole cottage industry of critics asking the question, why do we look up to these psychos? And it's because they're us in exaggerated form. "they are the luciferian selfishness that drives everybody under capitalism magnified into these figures of our reflection on ourselves and when i say us, i mean the people who watch these shows, so the college educated half of that middle and upper middle flob, and what do we see? we see these psycho. and what who operate purely from narcissism, and then the drama of the shows is them dealing with the consequences of that that they don't like, and they're of course, I'm not saying that we're all as evil as they are, we're not anywhere near as evil as they are, we all have humanity that they don't, but on the flip side, they are also much more competent and powerful than we are. when i say that they are us, i'm not just saying like the worst, they are our dreams of ourselves, our dark dreams of ourselves, if we were essentially we those guys, those characters are answering the question, what would i be like if i was handsome as don draper, if i was as good as chemicals as Walter White, if i had inherited a mob fortune and was also smart like Tony Soprano, what would i be like, what would i do if i had those sweet of skills and sweet of of of uh abilities and traits and attributes, those exaggerated stat, that exaggerated status, and the answer is we would be monsters, because we're operating from selfishness, once again, I'm not saying any individual person entirely, I'm saying at the population level, collectively, our decisions at the end of the point, the pointy end tend towards us. choosing the self most selfish path because we are fixed in a network of precarity and the counter and exploitation and mutual exploitation, self-exploitation with no undergirding uh class consciousness to solidify as an opposition and uh uh push back against. now that's what's being created. by the prestige tv genre that is this that is going to become cinaquin in my opinion culturally with the democratic coalition, i'm going to just say it, that's the democratic party, prestige television, viewers of prestige television, uh, that that if you want people say, i talk too much college, non-college, if you define it correctly, i could say prestige tv, no prestige tv, or r Prestige TV self-consciously indulged in and Prestige TV uh indulged in as just something else on the cultural menu and that like the whole package of prestige TV uh cultural artifacts and and like uh expectations and values are just sort of invisible to you uh so if that's what they're getting what about the bottom half of people watching network television what? going to get, well network television itself responded to the pressure of cable by doubling, by creating and then hyper-exploiting the concept of the reality television show, which is the the act of watching a show stripped of any artistic elements whatsoever, like as in it is no longer an expression of someone's you, creative will, it is just someone being themselves. and of course no one is themselves, everyone is performing, but every like the barest art in reality programming is the art of performance of oneself, which i could literally get that anywhere. it is just transparent and there was a while there in the early in the late early Otts just was reality tv is shaping up into a genre when reality or prestige tv was shaping up into its own genre reality tv was reaching depths that it has not gotten to since uh shit like fucking uh who wants to marry a millionaire the swan where people would get people with like facial deformities uh would get plastic surgery and they compete in a beauty contest with each with each other uh man versus beast where Kobayashi had a eating contest with a codiac bear and if the Prestige TV generation created their own characters, their drapers, their uh, their Walter Whites, their Tony Sopranos, what did the reality? tv generation, the people who do not find all of that pretention around, hey, this isn't television, this isn't entertainment, this is actually soulcraft, whatever the fuck people who convince themselves that there is some deeper transcendent artistic association with a television program, tried to talk themselves into, no, this is as good as a book, this is as good as as Shakespeare, they don't have the cultural wiring to trick themselves into thinking that's true, which is what it comes down to. they haven't been conditioned to think that's true, and so this whole thing, this whole performance of quality falls on deaf ears, so who gets created out of the muck of reality, a bunch of celebrities, most of whom are non-political, but what's this, a few of them become very political, one of them, of course, we all know, becoming king of them all, but back to the prestige TV shows, as I've said, prestige TV and tv antihero is sort of a cultural tipa, a cultural expression of like this greater demographic mass uh then Barack Obama is the prestige TV here uh president, he is the political equivalent, he is our expression of ourselves, which is as a narcissist, what would a narcissist, someone devoted to their lucifer? in self-pursuit do if they were to pursue the highest office in the land and just like the answer is, what would you do if you were a Madison Avenue Slicster is been drapeer, what would you do if you were a uh fucking uh teaching genius with uh cancer b Walter White, what would you do if you were a fucking baller ass uh black guy politician, you'd be president of the United States Burf Saco Crumbo. and clear and if you read the stuff that Obama has written about himself and written about himself and written about himself, he seems to know that he is this character, like he is driven to express himself, which is what we all are driven to, right? like that's the other part of this narcissistic compulsion is that how many people who watch all this artist, all this television watch these movies, believe themselves to be destined to participate in that process, to contribute to it, how many people have flames of self expression through like a creative life, that is the only life by the way that means anything in the entertainment that we consume, every fucking movie and tv show premises on the idea that working with your hands, long-term is a fait worse than death. That's basically the lesson we get for the culture is that you have to have a higher ambition, you have to either be working towards some sort of life of mental reward, or you have to uh be, even if you're in like a a a condition of of uh physical, manual or unstimulative labor, you have dreams that you're working towards. like and so we're all we are all we're all looking at ourselves through our entertainment is what i mean is that in a in a totally commodified artistic and cultural space like the one we have in all art boils down to flattery because you're trying to get people to watch it and people are going to watch it if there's something they like. about it and like we could talk about what quality is, but quality is much harder to buy than pandering, so what we get over time in every program to some degree? even our favorites, but way more degree in others and over time more and more, as I'm saying, this is a fucking linear, this is a progressive process, this is art being attenuated out of itself as we get microtargeted, the sum total of our uh of our media consumption is flattering, and you say, well, why are the anti heroes, why are they uh, why aren't they good guys? well, we have the good guys, those are us in our fantasys of our... but because this is art, because we've convinced ourselves that this is meaningful art, which means it has to make us uncomfortable, it has to make us challenge our assumptions, it has to make us feel something, this has to be the dark version of our fantasy self, of our flattered versions of ourselves, where we have the confidence of our heroes, but not of their moral uh character. and Barack Obama pursued his life like a fucking prestige TV anti hero. He is fully invested in the notion that the world is unchangeable, that the fundamental machinery of exploitation that make the world run is in unalterable. It cannot change. All we can do is find a place for ourselves within the gears and that the value. of our life comes from our ability to make those experiences uh meaningful to ourselves, and of course we can turn that in any other self-justification, but at the end of the day to create an impression, a a imagined growth, a pseudo growth to hide our central core of just narcissistic self uh compulsion, because Obama was driven narcissistically to the point of uh total commitment by a desire to be to be acknowledged and ratified by power, not to wield power, because he flatters himself intellectually too much to think that he could be so naive as to think that a politician could wield power, he knows they don't, that's part of what makes him deserve his station, because he knows that, and his knowledge of that gives him a layer of irony that coats all of his behavior and sanctifies every decision he made, which any position person in that position would make, but which another person, a cruder person, a less refined person, a person who didn't follow the rules, didn't the peop pinky extended, didn't go through the right ideological conditioning uh will make worse, and he justifies himself in those terms, there. nothing that anything could do, anything could only be worse, and the thing that made it better was him, and not his virtue, his irony, which is all you have, when you cannot find like a uh, when you feel in, when you feel that sense that happens, that has happened to me of total uh, complicity. in all the worst and most monstrous facets of life, there is a deep desire to just pull your own skin off and and and deny your guilt, and that has to go somewhere, a lot of it go, some people reactinaries for example love to put it outward, and uh, and and blame others, but uh, a sophisticate uses irony to condemn themselves, well, at the end, not condeming them. themselves, giving themselves the reprieve of self-awareness, and that's Obama, and he spent eight years as the economy, turning into this giggified hell for everybody, and and essentially denying a viable future to everyone who came out of the fucking sluce vats of childhood into adulthood, that became the expression of the... top half of that distribution of culture who both watch prestige tv and voted in elections, because remember even though there are other people vote and they are working class people who vote, they're not riding the cabose or they're not driving the train, they're not in charge of this process, because without working class act action without effective working class organization, the the democratic party will be run atomization and narcissism and and and uh every person for themselves behavior and so that means that these shows are essentially the brain of the people who run these parties and the people who put out the the talking points that make up the cultural conversation around both the shows and politics. and this is the PMC as people define it, this is like the thing that needs to be killed according to people, but what they're missing is that it is just this ghost, it's a ghost of a machine, and it's and and it's not in the sense that it's haunting it, in the sense that it's like levitating away from a fucking corpse, and so politics as the democratic party cohered around this Obama uh consensus which broke down with uh with which basically broke down with for lack of a uh successor, like that was the real reason they were fucked after that is they needed another one and there wasn't any, uh, but more importantly was the eruption of or actually no, Felix said something today on the show, uh, Hillary was the FX version, like uh, Obama is like the uh, the HBO, amC anti-hero. he's Walter White and Hillary was Jax Teller from Sons of Anarchy, just the offish FX Metalhead version because she's from the 90s and she didn't really she wasn't of the moment like Obama just stepped into it like a fucking rate, but anyway while Obama was creating this thesis, this political thesis, reality tv was creating this antithesis, and because it's reality television, and because the membrane of like propriety that the college people have. around themselves, that prophylactic of propriety that they used to fuck reality, even though it does nothing, it has nothing, it's just denying themselves pleasure, uh, they don't have, they're they're raw dogging reality, so give me Donald Trump, give me the actual reality show oath, give me the guy who's only actual artistic uh uh uh talent, his only talent in life is being obnoxious in a way that is compelling to watch and then make him the president. and then we got the rise of the the the reality tv antithesis, and now they're fused, you've got the prestige tv democrats and the reality tv republicans, and that doesn't mean that you know we're going to get another case of like perfect examples like this, and I think that these coalitions are going to see some uh pres in the coming years for sure, so there's no way of knowing where it goes from here, but I think that's where we are now. Ah, okay, that was good, yeah, trying to get all this stuff straight, cuz I want to be able to, whenever I get anything done, written down, I want to just be able to feel like I have made the my case and I don't have to like defend it anymore, that's my main thing. Oh, the other thing about Obama in Prestige TV, so this to me is the real nut of it, just as like a as a metaphor, so Barack Obama famously loved the wire, right? Loved the wire, loved watching it. many many liberals pointed to the fact, either publicly or you know in their heart that one of the things they liked about Obama was that he watched the wire, now what's the wire about right? wire is this dekensian fora into the demimond of Baltimore and it's a social, it's like a drizer like examination of the social ills created by our unjust system, and it even lays out like a case in f and the show is essentially the ideology of the Obama administration uh as a performance as as an aestheticized expression you got that first season right shows the horror of the war on drugs as you love to see entertainment but what's this oh it's failed this is a failed war on drugs it doesn't work oh shit oh fuck we've acknowledged that, we know that we know what's up, this problem, it's bad, and we are aware of the badness, what's all right, the second season answers the question, well why is so wait a minute, if the drug if it's if we can't solve this problem by locking up drug dealers, we got to find out what's causing it, if it's not just drug dealers, and the second season is about how yeah, this is all because the economy of Boltmore basically fucking shut down in the second 70s and there's no money and uh created cycles of poverty and dysfunction at every level political and economic life and it's it's it's like it's not actually that difficult, it's pretty clear, but crucially there can be no solution to it. because what is the only conceivable means of uh reversing this sort of economic trend right? you would think it would be some sort of uh labor movement? well, the labor movement is one part of the problem. labor, and even if Frank Sabadka is a good guy, he has no hope of actually effecting change, like it's a doomed uh criminal scheme that gets him killed in his fucking union to certify. and it ends on a note of, well damn, I guess we're not being to be able to do anything about that, so the next three seasons essentially find new culpats, real things that we can do something about, because we can't do anything about that pesky base, third season's about drug legalization, if we got to have these drugs, we don't have to be rocking people up, which of course the Obama administration never carried out, but you always got the feeling that they knew the... they should, you know, that's how people justify all this stuff, the fourth season identifies, oh man, we got a real bad school system, if only the schools were better, these kids would get in better situations, and then the third season, oh man, this media we got, it's pretty bad, we only had a better media, this thing could be better, and that is the way, that is the Obama Democrat, which is like the brain now of culture. uh approach to reality, this acceptance of capitalist realism, and then a jaundis view on reforms that we should undertake and try to make go, but which are at the end of the day, also probably insufficient, so how mad should we ever get that we didn't really do much more than we any of that stuff we said we would, we know what to do, but there's only so much we can do, and for a lot of liberal democrats. "the fact that Obama watched the wire stood in for having any actual coherent approach to any of the problems in the wire, because he'd seen it, and that is all of us in that headspace, feeling complicit in a system, but also precarious, wanting to uh, assert what we think is the best, for the best without rocking the boat too much to fall make us fall off of it, and the answer to that is, broadly uh neoliberal, the neoliberal democratic status quo, it's like, well, yes, this is a horrible, unlike unfortunate system, but and yes, I'm just one of the lucky ones who got out of this whole college experience with money and everything, but what else can we really do, what else, actually, let me rephrase this, what else can we really do that wouldn't risk my position, and the answer is not much, and that's democratic party, but the thing to remember is the republican. party is equally held by the wealthiest and most class coherent and uh portion of the people who reject all that bullshit, the ones who see this package of values and say no thank you, i'm on the other team. the bottom part of that coalition is no more able to assert influence at the political level than the bottom half of the democratic coalition is, and cannot for the same reasons. it's just beautiful boaters and and uh and the the small bourgeois, petty tyrant uh um uh buddy garities of the world trying to uh create a trying to act out this fantasy of national autarchy out of you know a this remnant the last gasp of the uh of the dreams of Jefferson that that anyone could be ungoverned because "the conditions to be ungoverned in that jefferson jacksonian sense no longer exist, but try telling them that, and you don't have to, because they still have money, and they still have a lot of power, and they still have political power, and they're going to assert it, and they are, yeah, they are at war with the the broader like globalized finance capital, but neither one of them have a goddamn thing for anybody below them, except exploitation and misery, they are horror, they are fucking trying to." maintain their position within this fierky, where the fuck will they get any benefit to uh, putting anything off to anyone else, in a moment of capitalist crisis when there is no structural incentive. either politically or economically for redistribution to occur in any framework, that's why you cannot get anywhere through either of these parties, i did watch the wire, what are you talking about, i saw the wire twice, not watching the wire critically, i don't what that means. and if you're saying i didn't i i didn't get the right message out of it that's not a thing sorry that's not a thing i know how it felt it seems to me to have been processed and you can't tell me i'm wrong obama didn't watch the wire what are you talking about obama watch the wire shut up you're gas lighting me conversation with president obama and wire creator David simon h president praises the HBO series the wire, fuck you, why would you do that? are you guys, are you guys getting riled up because i said something about your program you didn't like? it's still a good show, i've seen it twice. uh, you all are gasliting me and I'm not here for it, not here to be gaslighted, and by the way, forget what the politics are with the wire, it's entertainment value is undeniable, the the great acting, some decent photogr uh, decent camera work, although nothing too impressive, it's not one of the more uh, I mean it's like intentionally sort of neorealist I guess. uh, but without the wacky camera movements and there's good stuff in it, I enjoyed it, I've seen it, I'm just talking about it, it's residue, it's like political residue, and like I see a lot of people saying, like when Obama says he likes uh parasite or something, they say, did you really get it? It's like, well, you didn't really get it either, nobody really got anything, you get it the way you want to get it, he he's getting it the way he wants to. get it and we're all getting it the way he want the we want to get it, i think people like obama get it the way he got it, and that's why judging programs on their political content is dumb, because you're just looking at a mirror. Karkety, that's somebody said that, the only person on the wire who would have watched the wire is Carketti, exactly, and I think the reason people don't like that idea is because there is buried, even in the deepest materialist, I think who feels capped in this at some level, behold into cultural critique as like a way of life, that if enough people the right stuff, things would change, I think there's no way to understand people's response to art, the passion of the way they get about the politics of it, and the prescriptive way they get about the politics of it, if they did not believe that somewhere, there's no other way to make sense of their behavior, and that is in my mind delusion, because everyone's just going to see it the way they were going to see it, which is conditioned by their spot in life, your your... the magical elixir you think is in there is only seeable by you and specific people like you. so like people say does wolf of wall street make uh uh encourage being a amoral scumbag, yes, to amoral scumbags, i am not an amoral scumbag, and i had no desire to become one after watching that movie, it's a great movie, that has nothing to do with it. okay, good, i feel like i got somewhere there, that's good. shit i'm done watching tv, i i wanted to get this out there and now i feel like i have. feel like I finally kind of birth the baby on that one because uh more than anything when I was talking about prestige TV I just wanted to get at the idea that that that that the that the quality that's being imported there is is a it's a fantasy that we're all kind of participating in will consciously and unconsciously because we're we have to make do or we feel that we have to make do with it and I don't judge anyone for feeling that but I do feel like that's the underlying. drive and i didn't really ever feel like i articulated that nest as as fully as i have here, i feel good about that. most cringe HBO show? uh, that's a good question, i haven't seen all of them, um, that fucking the show, the weird romance show where they were all fucking all the time, you love me or whatever the hell it was, i was kind of like, what the fuck is that? dream on is good, shut up, it was sitcom plus boobs, what else you want, weeds is a showtime show, how dare you, oh god, news room is very cringy, newsroom is quite criny, i've never seen John from cincinnati, i kind of want to, i've heard it's pretty funny, i loved tales from the crypt, oh my god, that was appointment television for me, fucking cripkeeper, what a stitch, and that was HBO in its quintestance there before they got fancy, it was literally just EC comics, the stuff that they used to keep under the counter in the 50s and they had fucking uh conferences, the the the fucking keef offer committee had William Gains in to ask him why he was perverting the youth and it never that kind of content would never cut it with the FCC just condensed into a show guys getting their heads chopped off and topless women everywhere. that was the original pitch and then they got hawty and the thing is is i would r that's the lie because you can buy tits and blood you cannot buy art and that was the lie that HBO and all these other motherfuckers have been selling ever since and all these streaming motherfuckers have been selling ever since that this narrow casted pablo this this algebradically created shit this machine learned garbage is good and why because we need it. to be buse we fucking need it to be, beat a goddamn book, i'm trying and failing, trying to read books, trying to write a book, books are good, folks, what can i say, books, we love them, we love a book, we love a book, just read a book, but when you watch shows and i watch shows, just have fun, just have fun with it, don't get mad for no reason, and don't go into a show going, how can i use this show to express a political view in some way or like get mad at it or decide that defending it is part and parcel of defending like uh uh all that is good against the rising tide of reaction? Yes, Az does have the best theme song, I got to say much better, much better than the Sopranos, if you had told me that I had to judge which of those two shows would become the big cultural defining uh hit, come out of HBO's prestige lineup, and just by the theme song, I would have said oz. All right, going out on this, yeah, the soprano song is terrible, one of the worst, oh shit, am I going to get DCCIed for this? All right, I don't want to get DCCIed. All right, guys, talk to you soon, bye bye.
