 what comes up must come down spinning wheel got to go round dump all the troubles by the river side ride a painted pony let the spinning wheel ride got no money hey you got no o spinning wheel all alone drop all your troubles on you, you never learn, ride a painted pony let the spinning wheel turn. did you find the direction sun on the straight and narrow highway? do you sign, the reflection sign and showing you the... show you the colors that are real, someone is waiting just for you, stop all your troubles by the river side r a painted pony left the spinning wheel round, i got to change this, it's not supposed to be chatting, it's supposed to be, audience, everyone, oh oh, okay, there that is, that's why that did that, well get that out of there, i don't want to be there, i want to be in talk shows and podcasts, i've never chatted once in my life, how dare you accuse me of something like that, to say that i would waste my precious time on this earth, mindlessly, priddle praddling and listening to my own voice, something so pathetic and masturbatory is that. sir, I demand satisfaction for such columny. Who would think that I could do that? No, it's fine. I know I do that. It's fine. We all got to do something is the thing. This doesn't, this hurts fewer people than other options would have been, including me. You can make yourself in anything, but you can't make your context. Context makes you, and then you decide how to live within it. in a way that maximizes the the positive feelings of you and the people around you in concentric circles of relationship, and the thing is, the reason i subscribe to this is because it eliminates the supposed contradiction between best interest of the self and best interest of others. the illusion that there is a distinction before them, is created by circumstances of class rule for the most part, but also interpersonal conflict, trauma, as people call it, and the vissitudes of living in a natural world and being thrust against one another, like it's all made manifest in the moment, real conflict exists between people, but what we mistake is we take that and we eternalize it into a relationship, that's not the eternal element of the relationship, that's the contingent specific part of the relationship, the recognition, the fucking uh uh public choice monsters like to talk about like the entire uh undergirting theology and it is a theology of of modern capitalism is that there is an eternal conflict between the self-interest and the community interest and as I said that is a contingency of class rule that has been taken uh from something that ebs and flows as uh in a dynamic and stable relationship with the environment to something that destroys that balance and obliterates the feedback loop between the natural world and human society. and what predicates that fatal fracture, that rupture that is going to doom the society one way or the other, it's the uh denial of a expansive conception of self-interest, what rises up up us up out of natural relationship and creates something that transcends nature was cooperation, not competition, i don't know how this can be denied. the stuff that fans of capitalist style fans of western civilization like to point to as the fruits of human uh endeavor are not the fruits first of conflict, they are the first fruits first of cooperation, because what are they based in language? language is not created uh by a conflict, it's created by cooperation. now a cooperation that is fuled by conflict with others, is why you know we have these concentric rings of humanity, at a certain point, those are strangers to us, temporally, spacially, can't be given the same consideration as people were closer to, if we're to keep those bilateral trust relationships, that form everything, so there is the pressure of conflict, but the actual dynamic that births language is collective and cooperative. then you get contingent temporary regimes of difference and oppression that that uh arise based on different conditions of technology, the difference between the stages that are supposedly tomar marxism, people say, ah, it's stagist, that's bad, that's not how history works. that is only a attempt to periodize a process of technological sophistication, that's it. the history of class society, the history of class society, that is class society under regimes of language and recording and cul and and and physical culture that persists that we know of, that we can look back on and reconstruct, reconstruction, the evidence presficient for reconstruction was what makes something historical, historical class struggle is these cycles that go up and down and led to destruction of societies that create one order of domination that persists in one ecological condition and then break down under changes in those conditions because it cannot change internally because that would mean to surrender its antagonisms which are inside a society illusory and because they're illusory under pressure they often dissolve how do we we know from from much experience that under conditions of crisis yes people fight each other but they also come together and more effectively survive, there's a bottleneck and human evolution of 5,000 people who survived a a massive dramatic climate change in Africa in early human history. The people who made it through that bottleneck did it, yes by fighting, maybe a little bit, but way more, day to day, moment to moment, way more cooperation. Uh, someone says I'm like an anarchist, no, no, no, no, how dare you? There's a reason that people like, uh, David Graber like to fixate on the period right before this happens, because then they can point to this fluidity, but we're thing is we're looking through the prison. of capitalism and the thing about capitalism is that it is an inflection point of technology, if you use technology broadly to mean everything from like the uh the devices used to you save labor and a manufactury process, stuff that emerges out of uh ship building and and whatever uh and and trade, warfare, like those technological changes, but also just... fucking protestantism as a social technology, the written word is a social or the printed word rather as a social technology, that confluence of technology takes humans from one relationship to their environment to another, from one degree of embeddedness and one degree of uh of uh intimacy, feedback removed. through urbanization, technological abstraction and the death of revealed religion, all that stuff comes together and creates a new world where we are now, embedded institutionally in technologies of capitalism that sustain our sense of ourselves as individuals, like our deepest human subjectivity, the experience of our lives, the stuff that we, not the trauma, but the day-to-day, that happened, then that happened, like the the creation of an understanding of the world with us at a stable center, that is predicated on these institutions. and they means they have to be taken over and used for collective good if we are to sustain this subjectivity. the subjectivity that anarchist seek to preserve by not going through this process of of rationalization that they're terrified of that will eat up their precious uh uh subjectivity is actually the only thing we can preserve it because the anarchist uh recipe is for uh just the cyclical grinding into oblivion uh of everyone uh within caught within the lowering lower half of the gears of this machine buse like the the anarchist like they they do make a very strong point in how contingent all this is. but the real funny thing is that they think that they're like 19th century anarchist because like you know i know from experience having read anarchist literature and dabbled with it as a yonger man uh that the load stars are things like the uh spanish civil war uh and and like uh spanish anarchism which flows out of the experience of the feudal rural subject in the the direct exposure of feudal rural subjects in in uh mostly southern Spain in the mid-19th century after the triumph of liberalism imported from France you have this direct con the direct like dropping uh um like an ice cube onto a fucking hot gridtle you have this inert relatively inert feudal subject in the... the ladifundias of southeastern western Spain who are made to come into contact with capitalism basically instantaneously in the 19th century rather than as happened in uh France and in specifically England and the Netherlands before them this process of uh of of moving through a development from rural subjects to urban ones from uh feudal subjects to capitalist ones from people relating... in a social matrix to people relating in a uh estraged market, like that process created new subjectivities that people inhabited over time. the mid-19th century, is the uh inert, relatively inert, feudal subject of rural Spain brought into a capitalist social relationship, essentially overnight, once they uh, once the Spanish reformation comes in the form of the disposition of church and municipal lands, the enclosure that allows for subsistance living among these very marginal of peasants in the very bad lands of in andalusia specifically and that's Tramadora and like because only the periphery, only the coastal areas of Spain really have uh land that sustains long-term deep agriculture because they're the only lands that are irrigated properly, so you have... the establishment in a ring that extends from the bass country in the pyranes down to Catalonia in the south uh or I'm sorry the northeast then down along the coast the levant valencia uh you have there fertile lands that can produce real surplus and sustain in the aftermath of feudalism as it sort of uh shifting away can as the feudal duser being relieved can sustain those former uh tenants to become smallholders and so you have a small holding peasantry in these relatively well off areas in the periphery of Spain, but in the middle and in the south the southwest specifically south of Madrid, this is much more marginal land, intensive intensive cultivation, and also the use for pasture lands for sheep has rendered much less fertile over time, at a very at the very most that the uh that the lee way that the feudal system allowed for people to stay on the land or near the land is kicked out from under you, no, your feudal rights are your feudal responsibilities are gone, but sorry your feudal rights, if you cannot. afford to pay for the tenancy on this land, you don't have it, you cannot go and grase your sheep on on public lands or any of this stuff, that is all owned, it is all being put to profitable use or left fallow as their owner sees it, and this throws a huge chunk of of the rural peasantry into a position of landlessness, yes, somebody asks, the muslims didn't really have feudalism, did the Spanish reintroduce it? Yes, they did. In fact, around the time, we didn't get into it too much in hell of earth, but during the period we're talking about, on the land, there is a re-ensurfening of the Spanish uh peasants, like they the process, yes, they had introduced surfdom with the victory, and then they had uh uh, lighten the ties as many other countries did in the post black death era, sorry, but like then early Monterera, because it's all post black, uh, but then... uh in the in the uh in the crisis period that happens after the the golden agents they start increasing feudal obligations and refuudizing the countryside because you got a problem of you how uh your agriculture was not getting more productive so that means it needed to be more labor intensive, but when you rationalize that relationship, almost overnight, feudal obligations are banned in 1888, sorry 1811, the church lands and municipal lands are sold off in 1837, and around the same time, capital is starting to formulate in the bass country and in Catalonia, these places that actually have natural resources and relatively prosperous crop land, they're building industry, so this group of increasingly dispossessed uh peasants become a rural and an urban proletariat, some stay in the countryside and work like for very little money only on the harvest and are essentially unemployed the rest of the year uh or they go to predominantly some some of them go up to the boss country but many more go down to bilbao where they have uh they have a textile industry that builds up around this uh agricultural capital and capital from France and they are encountering capitalism as a subjectivity that is fully foreign to them, these are not a class of like artisans who have been solely introduced into urban life and then turned into uh generationally turned into proletarians, these are people went to people understood themselves as on the land and of the land cast into this non-person status in a land-based society, in a land-based religious order. I know Bill Baw was in the past country, did I say otherwise? And so their experience of the modern sub of liberal subjectivity is to spit it out, to spew it out, and I think one way and a way to understand the CNT and the Spanish anarchist movement. in general is this collective renunciation of engaging in the process of turning into a capitalist subject. marxist uh socialism emerges among and is abraced by those people who are early to the process of proletarianization. so the socialist movement in Spain comes after anarchism and comes uh first to the capital which is not an industrial center, it has a working class among like type setters for newspaper. and the building trades, these are people have worked for wages with their skills to extract a relatively high, compared to others including in the countryside, standard of living and upward mobility, so when they hear how are we going to get more for us as workers, the marxist call of work through the institution of capitalism makes sense because they're embedded in it to the point where they're seeing returns for it. "the rural proletarians of andalusia, and aragon and and Catalonia, form the bulk of the anarchist movement, are outside of that process, they never get there, they are never integrated, they are made to, they are put to war by their local capitalists, because there is no strong, centralizing, reforming state that can ride heard on these..." and so instead of recognizing unions and negotiating in a way that could see benefits for collaborating with capitalism, collaborating with the state. if we can understand the site as separable from capitalism, which marxists do and anarchists don't. why? because they're they are experiencing it from a literally a different vantage point, a different relationship, temporally and spatially to a idea, the uh Christian millennium of European peasantry, which is the village commune without the bosses, which now because they've been kicked out by the so-called they don't go to protestantism, they don't get an alternative religious explanation for the world, because it's the 19th century and they're getting capitalism full in the face, they switch directly to an alternative to religion, because anarchism's social values were pretty much identical to medieval christianity, the early exponents of Spanish capital of anarchism traveled the countryside like fucking mendicant. they lived among the people in ostentatious virtue, they didn't drink, they didn't gamble, they didn't smoke, they didn't eat meat, they were straight-ed social, secular saints, and they pointed to this, this big rock candy mountain that is just the social gospel of medieval christianity, and why shouldn't it be, these people are literally christians, they have not gone through the rock tumblr of demystification that urban populations largely had in other parts of Europe by this period, the late 8, 19th, early 20th century, they are, the anarchists are essentially the anabaptist of the Spanish reformation, and there's a lot of them because is creating a lot of them because unlike the other capitalizing European western countries that had their uh uh empires to dump out the negative externalities of capitalism development too, or in the case of france when they lost their the the their uh they lost the the main part of their empire uh they just went nuts and had a fucking revolution and revolutionized their social institutions. in this more egalitarian framework and creating nationalism in the process. uh, those people were ready for this to to to move through a capitalist subjectivity a that they already had. the the the spanish outside of this process pushed to the margins of it and having like the worst life living like they were hungrier, they were literally. than poor people in these other European countries, now of course those people are less hungry because they've got a like napoleon's army is conquering Europe or the Europeans are or the English are conquering North America and India, like they're displacing the hungry mouse outward like in the late 1600s, I'm sorry, in the mid 1600s, England had the last of its famin ever, it never had a famin again after that, which used to be a cyclical feature of European. in trade network, the imposition of capitalism through the world system, stripped, they stripped them of that capacity, and so they they ate, they went Hungary and start, Ireland to, Ireland was a net exporter of calories during the entire Irish, the entire potato family, because the the productive acrage in Ireland was taken by big, absenty landlord Latafundias much like in southern Spain. and the difference here between Spain and the other European countries, they lost their empire and now it's coming home earlier, buse they lost it first, and why do they lose it first because they got it first? because whatever social network gets power, once it can no longer expand, which is what happened to Spanish colonialism uh in Europe and elsewhere in the 1600s, when they lot they they they lost... uh expan, they lost their expansionary edge of settlement in the Americas and they lost uh the Netherlands, and then they uh the what they have in Latin America in the early 1800s, so they lose it first because they can't reform their institutions in the face of this crisis, because their institutions have been made by victory, the Dutch fall for the same thing, the English rise, they beat the French, the... defeated French turn inward because they can no longer expand outward and they have a revolution that creates this new synthesized, subjectivity and political techn and political economy and technological structure of state that is capable of much more than these feudal remnant states that were dragging themselves towards modernity could, and that made everybody adjust, including the Spanish, and that means it made everybody against their will capitalize their economy. and that had consequences, and in underdeveloped country like Spain, the consequences are that your most exploited people are now able to mobilize using mass media and politics uh mechanisms like newspapers, cinemas, radio, the concept of the union and political party, this is stuff that the German peasants who rose in the 17 in the 1500s would have killed for, and this is essentially the same group, and these are also by the way, the same people wh form the the core of the red army, once Malou reorients, reorients the Chinese communists to the countryside, landless hakka uh peasantry in the south of China. I think it's by the way, just parenthetically, the way that all this is generated by the necessity of uh of climactic change, how we're all really, we are we are all only reacting to the knock on the door from our uh ecology which our systems of power obscure from us, the place where many of the conquistador leaders including Hernando Cortes came from in Spain was called is called estramadora, and that is that means like the someone knows what it means, but it's like the extreme extremities, it is the boond. It's the least uh uh it's the least it's it's I believe we're uh but it's got some of the worst land in the country extremely hard it's rocky soil very little real agriculture there and that's where guys like Cortes who are of this Hidalgo class of former knights who now had nothing to rule over they go off and they decide to conquer. new world and they their extremity uh fuels this momentary hegemy for Spain that they can't hold on to because things changed a new other countries respond to their actions and they can't respond in turn and we are at the same point in the our cycle the difference between our current reality though and all of theirs is that this is the first truly global uh regime of um like unified global machine of uh a mode of production, like we have other things embedded within capitalism, but we have a global capitalism now, and what collapse looks like under those circumstances cannot be conceived of, because all other cases had been localized, it's the local environment that's knocking on your door, which allows for equalization across a bio, we are now getting the door is knocked being knocked on, but there is no exterior out, there's no way off, there's no vent. Uh, someone wants to know why Spain didn't do Portugal like they did the boss country in Catalonia. We talked about this on hell on earth, but uh, during the the 30 years war, the cost of fighting it was really pissing off the regional powers, because while Spain was able to create a precocious dynastic state, it still was riven by these regional overlords that it had to playcate, it had placated them all through the the reconcuesta and that relationship of like military tribute for the process of kicking the mores out of Iberia defined the Spanish political system until it's collapse and it was able to through these desperate hidalgos conquering half the world create this new power, but it could not sustain that as times progressed. entropy entered the system and other states mobilized against them, so in the mid in the 18th, 1630s, they're spending a lot of money uh to fight the 30 years war and... the fight the French, it's pissing off all the regional powers who don't feel like it's their fight, the canlands rise against having troops quartered there, people talk about the third amendment, how it's silly, it came from a real experience of uh domination of having to pay for in quarter uh the troops of the king and uh so the quartering of troops helped spark the reapers war, but then they tried to get the top uh gentleman in Portugal to laid an army to come and conquer uh uh Catalonia, this is when Portugal was part of the uh the Spanish uh Empire after the union the iberian union of 1580 I believe after uh king uh what was he is he king Stephen the idiot who went and Leroy Jenkind himself Sebastian King Sebastian King Sebastian of uh of Portugal Leroy Jenkind himself to death in North Africa uh in a absolutely hair brain crusade uh and he's married to one of the Habsburgs of Spain and they take over uh that's similarly by the way how the Habsburg end up taking over Hungary because they have uh they married into the Hungarian Royal family but then the king of Hungary gets murked at the battle of Mohat uh and that means that the uh Hungarian throne then goes to the Habsburgs they got so fucking lucky which is again why they were not able to win because the... were going on luck, they were not changing with the times like the other struggling middle powers did, once you create a situation and you're on top of it, you get lazy inherently uh, because what's worked in the past should keep working, it's not any default in your character, it is simply a human response to stimuly, we have limitations, and then the other countries emerge and they they eat their lunch, and that means Spain doesn't really defuutilize. until the mid 20th century, 19th century, and so anarchists were trying to preserve this medieval way of being, and the thing is from our perspective, wanting to get closer in some way to a enchanted relationship, to our experience of the world, when I say enchanted, I simply mean my sense of self-interest extends beyond the self, my sense of where I reside extends outside of me, that's all enchanted means and that's what we were, we want from the medieval world, that's what we're pining towards, now the 19th century. spanish and 20th century spanish anarchists, that's a living thing to them, and they're trying to save it, even as they're being proletarianized, and that is, I think, it's doomed, but it is heroic, and it is to be celebrated because it's the human spirit expressing itself, what it should not be is fetishized into practice among people like us who are not experiencing the feudal idol as like a real remnant of our lives, we have had that ripped from us, if we back, we will only create a dead nostalgic version at the point of a gun, which is what fascism is. fascism is just the attempt to recreate the medieval idol with the machinery of power by just tearing our frontal lob, but you can't do it, all you'l do is empower capitalism and become an instrument of it, which is why there is no dissident right, you're just dressing up your worship of the death machine. as your own will, but it is not, you are, you are surrendering the last of your humanity, there is nothing honorable about it, we have to understand that if we are in this subjectivity, that we have to move through this subjectivity, and that means that if we are to maintain it and transcend it, we have to deal with the situation, and that means trying to see control of these machines that have been built to strangle us with the... that we can reprogram it, and the thing is if we do believe in ourselves, we should believe in our ability to do that, and anarchist talk about how like it's it's a faith in the human spirit, well if you have a faith in the human spirit, you should have a faith that that's possible, like it's all last men, like we are, we are nichi's last man, and that includes especially the people insisting that they're different, because they've got a podcast. because they uh, they epically uh pill people on the jq or whatever the fuck, they think that because they have rendered themselves uh indigestible by popular media, that they are have like renounced their uh soul deadening immersion in a thing that robs them of their life every day, the lavam of their vitality every day, and i've we're all in this situation, we're all being drained. and we are all resisting it to the best of our ability. the best of our ability would be if we were able to do it together, and that's always going to be the hope. but anyway this is why uh so I'm starting writing I'm finishing up the uh the note taking before I start writing the Spanish Civil War series that I'm going to do later this year and I've said before like I want to do one that pisses the people who fetishize the Spanish anarchists and the people who think they were incredibly annoying and uh stand the communist party that ended up basically taking over uh Republican Spain by the middle of the war. uh, piss them both off, but and I do want to piss them both off by trolling both of them uh, and showing sort of the absurdity of both their situations, because both their situations are absurd, but because like yes, the communist can make fun of the anarchist all day for being a bunch of goofs and they were, but like they're they were banking on an alliance with the democracies against Hitler that was just never going to happen, and like there in a... ability to see that makes their whole striving for the uh acceptance of the democracies look pathetically naive in retrospect and the evidence shows was always misplaced, but I don't want to just do that, I want to have real sympathy for every everyone, because I feel like like in both movements and in the left, the working class movement in general in the in the 19th and 20th century, you see like the these spirit of man crying out against its extinction, and so anybody who's like moved to act by that in one way or the other is, I think worthy of respect and should be regarded as a heroic being, but the tragedy is that a hero has a fault, and that unless they can coordinate their actions and eliminate our their individual faults, those will over time overcome all other goal, strivings and that's what happened. they couldn't trust across the chasm of time and space, the relationship to the medieval uh village idol that that the defined uh the the split. so yeah, i i want to, i want to troll both sides, make fun of both sides, but also give my absolute respect to two sides and to more than anything emphasize just the tragic. nature of the situation, like I think now at this point in history we can acknowledge these events as tragedy rather than have to assume that we need to like pick one side or another to defend because it has a strategic or tactical availance, it doesn't, the world described is so different now that the way we're going to struggle away, the way we're going to resist the extinguishment of our last individual humanity is going to uh occur at a much less grand register, and we just have to accept that, and that's that's not bad news, it only feels that way from the point of our absolutely hyperinflated, delusional, honestly psychotic individual egos, see this is interesting, somebody says, for me, it's the opposite, it's too early to tell one way or the other, i completely agree. but once again we're talking about a new cycle. i just think that a lot of people seem stuck believing that we are still meaningfully at a point within the cycle we're in and not overdetermined terminally towards um cyclical collapse, but out of that will be a new dynamic that we are also part of, because it's not one thing than the other, it's overlapping. things, because it's all one thing, the cycles is is just like period, the periodization of the modes of production or the stages of history, it's just a backwards narrativization of a continuous process, which you could define most broadly as the accumulation of entropy within the human social organism. someone asks how's the meditation going? it's actually going very well. uh, i have been meditating basically every day, like in for an amount of time that i would have only a few years ago thought literally impossible because i just couldn't sit. uh, i i i cheated a little bit because i have to sit back onto something, i can't just sit freely because i do have incredibly uh herniated discs in my back and... i i don't think i'm enough of an enlightened being to overlook that for long enough you know to be able to sit long enough so i feel like that's a that's whatever it's fine but i've been finding it to be very uh interesting i feel like i'm unleashing cundolini energy, you know, I'm like, I'm getting, it feels like sometimes like I'm getting a neck massage without any hands on me, uh, and that's interesting, it feels like I'm uncorking something. Also, uh, I am thinking more in images than in words while I am meditating, which is very interesting, uh, because I have like, I would say that like the time that I was felt most hopeless as a human being is the time that my mental terrain. was the most dry literal and the least uh uh iconic and symbolic. I mean, I know, I know that language is a symbol too, but for me it means a literal vocal uh uh uh stream of consciousness, like I know that this is a big phenological question, like how do people experience consciousness? I can only speak for myself and I know this is not universal. I experienced, not anymore, or at least less, but still someone, I experienced. consciousness as a voice in my head, the closest thing, I couldn't, it's not like I felt like I was hearing it in my head, I knew it wasn't being perceived sensuously, but it was words in sentences and that was basically it, like I was looking at what I was looking at, and then I was thinking about what I was thinking at, and that was when I was the most hopeles and like unknowingly depressed in my life, like I was deeply deep. unhappy and paralyzed and unable to really do anything and include enjoy anything uh and that was a big reason uh, but I would say that over the over the years and certainly with meditation I have, I am able not to stop it, can't stop it, but I've stopped, more importantly, I have stopped judging myself for it not stopping, and then by just letting it run and like breathing and all that stuff, I'm seeing things like I'm... actually seeing uh uh like a a more uh sensuous imagistic uh and that is more visceral uh understanding of the world oh the beginning buddhist book that I recommended was uh is called mindfulness in plain English which I highly recommend apparently it's like a high school textbook in Thailand. and of course i i would not i would not be honest right now if i did not say well this is also happening my body is experiencing weird pains that i associate in my mind with different uh fatal uh conditions that i have experienced through media either representations of or descriptions of and so while i'm having this experience. I'm also having these feelings, and so my my experience of this is this biforrcated uh sense of spiritual progress coupled with a mounting physical sensation of like uh biological extinguishment, which is because I was brought up believing that the two could not coexist, so therefore if I am dying, my spirit must be extinguished, and so spirituality, like getting beyond the narrative in my head, getting beyond just this dry stream of consciousness is death, because I cannot imagine leave living that way, so I am creating this uh, low grade psychosis, I guess around my physical, bodily conditions, and then hallucinating these feelings now. they might be real as the thing and i am just narrativizing these sensations uh, but what made me like able to move forward with this and not be trapped in a cycle of of newrosis is when i realize that they're the same thing, like okay, might die, might just be enlightened and then go on to another thing, the subjective experience of it will be similar enough that there's nothing to be afraid of, that's how I make sense of it, and that is why I've been doing this for the past three years instead of doing therapy, maybe I should have been doing therapy, but this is what I have been doing instead, it's given me the ability to feel okay most. the time obviously i have ups and downs, i understand that humanity, a human being is mostly juice, like the juice is what feels, like what you're really feeling, the sensations of your body. existing is the movement of juice through your body, the squishings of juices around, and so the thing about juices is the juices do not stand still, they cannot, by definition, they move, uh, and so I'm just feeling the juices moving through my body, and that's sometimes going to feel good, and sometimes it's going to feel bad, and I have accepted that that the juice level is not really up to me, because I think what, what, what hurt me, and I think hurts lot of people is you feel just bad and you can't name it and then you try to name it with things are in your life and then you sort of fixate on that and it pulls you away from the life you are leading and it make it poisons your relationship to everything around you, i'm speaking for myself, maybe this maybe others understand what this is like, but if you're not trying to find a purpose, not trying to find a narrative of like what it is, you can just sort of like let bad bad feeling. through you and still have a residue of you know just basic uh happiness and uh the sense of gratitude connected to your memory of what life can be, so that's what I'm trying to do, trying to become the the the wind in the key hole, somebody says that uh they understand what that was like and weed fixed it for me, this is very funny actually because the... weed is what makes me feel most intensely the uh the bodily changes like the weed is where i feel like oh like that hurts oh what's wrong with me but that i think has uh become for me a essentially exposure therapy so i am exposing myself to this and i'm able to experience the pain and then around it, not denial and panic, which it used to be, but wrap around it, okay, what, so what, what if this is real, what if this is like directly tied to a a impending narrative of some sort of extinguishment, what is permanent about that condition, the pain that you're feeling and that you're afraid of, it is by definition limited, it has an end like all things do, what's at the other side of that experience? and it is no experiences and also all of them, and the coming to the condition of total knowledge leaves you with the last flip of the coin on ecstasy. as you work through the contradictions of a mind that has been defined by traumas that knock it. away from its understanding of the world so that it could be an individual and operate as an individual, those all are wound back in, and that's all a process that is painful, but if pain can be understood as a temporary condition, and the knowledge, the faith in a final evening, negation of the negation that leaves you with the residue, of grace, i think that's what keeps me relatively uh, relatively chill and certainly happier than i ever used to be, and i think that is what i that's what, that's what validates my face. is that every every experience i have in which i am living that truth is good for the most part and ones i don't are bad you know and i know it's like i also know that i am in a a moment of my life where i am pretty much free of any want i'm like in a zone of total contentment of course the knowledge that that's temporary robs you of the ability to enjoy it in the moment at least it does for me. because I am addicted to wanting everything all the time good, but if I can accept that the flip side of yes, this idol is temporary is that anything I'm afraid of interrupting it is also temporary, I can just live with that, and since that's what makes me feel good, then that has to be what is true because it feels good, well also telling me, I can fall short, but it telling me that everybody else I No, everyone around me, every everyone I interact with in my life should be treated with total respect and love, now I don't do that. all the time because I am a bundle of these contradictions created by trauma, but I can hear that voice and I can honor it when I when I'm lucky enough to be able to. So I don't, I don't know if anybody has any experience with uh hypochondria or other mental problems. therapy if that sounds if any of that makes sense or if it sounds like someone should be getting a fucking uh either somebody should be getting a butterfly net or i should check myself into the hospital i don't know because that for me is the same thing that keeps me doing it it's like would it be am i ignoring a reasonable urge to do to do either of those things and the thing I'm not, you know, like I uh, I don't avoid the doctor, I go, I get my, I get my blood done, I, I, I, they they give me the, I tell them what's wrong with me, and and beyond that, I really don't have anything else I can do, if I start like trying to find something more specific then you are into territory where what is motivating you, the desire to avoid the necessity of death, because if it's coming in that way then you can't really stop it, something happens changes, you can change when you need to, but beyond like doing prophylactic things like trying to eat well and exercise, uh, you just have to live with it, and the thing is living with it is good, living with it feels good. Saint therapy, I don't know what that is, it's a good name, just as a uh, saint therapy, paint saint of uh, of upper west side jews. what is saint therapy sound? yes, saint therapy is the metallica movie, thank you uh cd baby, that's very funny, and so i know that like me talking to this, talking about this stuff, it's therapeutic to me, because well saying it out loud and and having people validate it makes me think, all right, i have a minimal amount of coherence to others, meaning that the words that i'm saying have a minimal amount of conviction, because as I'm saying them, i think they're true, so since it feels good to say them in that it gets good response and it feels like i am getting something off my chef, i have a subjective experience of relief from saying the words, and then the validation from others that yes, these are words that make sense in this order. that is the that's the plumb line that tells me that my faith is justified, that's i hope nobody screen caps that that looks that looked very bad what i just did, i was just trying to show the putting a plumb line down, oh god, i'm doing it again. how do i feel about the titanic submarine song? i don't, it seems to me to be there's no, i mean you, i don't understand what you could talk about about it, i mean it's you want to tell a joke, okay, but like that's it. but it's very interesting to me that that like the emblematic discourse cycles that exist at this level, that this stage of social media, this decaying stage of social media uh, is so much based on debates about the adequate of how to respond to situations, like there is not even in our metadiscussions a question of action, like we've totally obliterated the idea that we could even conceptualize, hey, imagine someone doing something, that is beyond our conception, we cannot meaningfully feel a sense of uh, of um fuck empathy, we cannot meaningly flee empathize with people who do stuff, like this is what happens when you get to the poisonous end stage of western i isolated individualism where you cannot imagine anybody else having any meaning, your life is the only life that matters, your experiences are the only experiences that matter. you just cannot go by that barrier. when you're at that end point, you your limited capacity for empathy is extended almost exclusively to people that you can recognize one way or the other. i can only hempathize with somebody who i relate to. this is why people talk about wanting a relatable people in movies and tv shows. they need to be able to relate because otherwise there's no reason for them to care. and we collectively, the people, the thwarted people talking on social media, collectively cannot empathize with somebody who does anything, so all of our meaningful debates are the around the hypothetical act of commenting on someone else doing something. That's where we're stuck, talking about, how should we as a steril and neutered mass of completely uh controlled drones, completely house broken puppies, how should we arrange ourselves, what is the ethic and eticat of arranging your facial features when something happens around us. and it's nobody's fault, like this is just where we are, this is the only, we are not this, but this is where we are, and I think that's a meaningful distinction. I think a lot of the reason people consider people call me, for example, a doomer is because of my insistence that we're not going to push anything forward through the forms of democracy and media that we have now, they think that means, oh, you think humanity is doomed, no, I think this iteration, this idea of the self that we inhabit is not viable. it is a psychosis that will be corrected by nature, that does not mean that it's the end of humanity, that is the beginning of humanity, and the main thing that that involves is the reduction of the ego, it is not the death of the spirit in the way that these people think you're talking about or the mass death of humanity even, it is the reconfiguration of the ego towards others, so that means that well the... the the people that we inhabit to interact on social media are husks, are broken people, and and the reason and we we orient our politics by looking at other versions of us, other broken people wearing these broken people costumes to talk to each other, and finding one specific contrasting point, and then fixating on that and saying, you're actually the problem, everything sucks because of you, but it's just a fucking mirror. and yeah, that is a hopeless sterile contest, politics as we understand it as we express it in their and media, yes, that is sterile, but that is not us, that is us in those moments, yes, we spend too many of our moments doing that, but we also spend our moments together and we spend our moments trying to survive, and it's what we do there, that will transform us, and that transformation can happen instantaneously. and dramatically enough that it doesn't matter that for the most of the time we all feel like we're trapped in these lives, the change that can happen to humans is almost is instantaneous and not maybe totally dramatic, but it snaps us from one understanding of ourselves and pushes us on down a different path, and it is a cadam katatamasi damarsi, what is that fucking video game call, accumulation of a new soul, part is stripped away by traumatic uh shifts in our understanding of the word around us and and the time we spend doing things and then the for the movement forward creates a katamari damacy effect is we just create a big ball of of of spirit. so we will all have our confrontations with the true conditions of our lives and we will all move forward from that, and that will be where humanity lives, one way or the other, predicting it is pointless. you have to live it, you can look at the past for contours and for like some some degree of eternal varities, but you have to bring not like a structure with you into your future, but a heart, well someone brings up the very strong point that the... this is an excuse to just keep jacking yourself off instead of uh doing direct action to the point of uh compromising enemies to have permanent end that's true but again what did i say in this moment we are the husk versions of ourselves if we're going to do anything like that and I sure shit I'm not saying I am buse I am comfortable it's going to take a lot to move me off the block let me be honest. but right now, i am uh, i'm i'm in the mask, i'm in the i'm in this, i'm in the husk zone with everybody else, i couldn't talk about doing that if i wanted to, anybody who talked about that in here in this zone, anybody you post about that, by definition is either trying to get somebody arrested or is full of shit, i'm not saying that your heart might not want you to do something like that. but all of the thought and planning had to be done in the real world, with other people, not winding yourself up with what is essentially your own voice kick back to you, which is what social media is. so I am happy to meet you as a husk, because I feel like even though I am a husk, this is like enough of a vocation. as pathetic as that is, and and awful that that that capitalism has thrown up this way to be, but as long as it is, I'm gonna try to be the huskiest husk I can be. that's why I try to talk about history, baby, because I feel like that's where we can spark an illuminating flame that we can carry with us. I like this, someone says, what a make of the Walter Benjamin quote that revolutions aren't the locomotives of history, but people pulling the emergency break, indeed, that's exactly what they are, no, we are not, there is no way that we can look at... the history of revolutions in the modern era and say that any of them were instigated by any group of revolutionaries, even our beloved Russian revolution, the paradominic revolution, which I would argue is only really relevant in the specific contex that we don't aren't in anymore, and so therefore the value that we want to ascribe to it from a tactical perspective is uh pretty marginal, we're talking about a country that once again encountered feudalism. uh where feudalism encountered uh capitalism directly in the 19th century. the United States is a country that never even had a feudal era. you could argue about slavery in the south, but like the creation of a racial cast meant that uh white citizens of the United States never had a feudal condition of of relationship to power. but anyway, even if you want to talk about the Russian revolution, the the will and vision of trotsky and Lenin, uh, that's only in the context of World War One, and the February revolution, just the fact that the state machine was incapable of fighting a modern war, and why should it, it was still on a feudal, it was on a feudal engine, it was trying to fight a a a 20th century technological war with a feudal social engine. uh, one third of white southerners are were landless and propertyless, propertyless in 1860. that is more than anything the real tragedy of reconstruction is that, yes they should have killed all the fucking planters, obviously, they should have strung up everybody with epilet. on your shoulder in the fucking confederate army, there is no question that that's what you do, if you want your your regime to withstand uh a challenge to it, you do that as a minimum, but but the real failure of reconstruction, the less satisfying and sanguin one, but the real grassroots one was failing to incorporate the poor landless, whites of the south into a political coalition in the republican party with the free slaves, which was possible, and I think that a close study of reconstruction shows that it was possible, which to means that the whole racial inevitability, DNA. story that America was doomed is incorrect, which is where I get my wellspring of belief in human spirit from, and you see the evidence if you're looking for it, and of course you're motivated to, but so what, I got to live in this life, but there was a chance to expropriate the big land owners of the south and redistribute that land to both former slaves and landless whites to create a unstoppable. political machine, the reason that didn't happen, the main reason that didn't happen is that the the republican party post Lincoln had been taken over by its reactionary wing, which is exactly what would happen later after the death of FDR when the reactionary wing of the Democratic party took power. Johnson was the worst possible outcome, there's nobody else could have gotten the the the... vp nomination, no other conceivable candidate, when you think of like who he realistically could have offered, obviously they offered it to Benjamin Butler, but if they left it to Hamlin, if they'd given it to uh to uh salmon P Chase for Christ sake, who is a complete buffoon, and I think honestly when you look at how America's history cracks and how contingent the... start with, like the real, the first thing that that pushes us in one direction or another, the way they come, the assassination of lincoln, the replacement with Johnson, the death of FDR, the replacement with Truman, and the way that these accumulate, you're both seeing you, the will, the wish, the wistful desire for things to be different, but also a suspission that we might just be in a timeline defined by defeat, and that the victory will come for people to whom we are. in cultural respect strangers and that's fine, but you have early collaboration among uh poor whites and and not even all the poor whites in in areas uh in the appelation areas and in in the hill country in the interior south where there wasn't a lot of slavery local white opinion was hostile to the... federacy as a concept, they stayed loyal to the union the whole goddamn war, and they got oppressed for it, they got they got chased down by uh, by uh, people hunting draft, like bounty hunters who were hunting draft dodgers and shit, and they were happy to punish the fucking uh planters after the war, they were the ones that they blame for it, as did the white uh, middle class whites in the north by the way, they were happy to fucking punish the southerners more. yes, southern West Virginia was pro-confederate, the part that's closest to the fucking uh bottom land. East Tennessee, which would have succeeded if there'd been more union troops there to defend the local leadership, uh, they would have fucking succeeded from Tennessee, but they were, but they were occupied militarily by the south, and they fucking hung a bunch of the local unionists. but why do the whites not adhear? racism played a big part, but the more critical part, the more material part is that we never really got a reconstruction of the south, the way say that Europe got a reconstruction after world war ii. there was not a massive public investment in the south, there was a dribble of private investment mostly around speculative railroad concerns who were wildly corrupt. and why? because the reaccionaries took over the republican party on behalf of uh the old wig business interests wanted a strong doller, wanted to get the uh the greenbacks out of the system, wanted to prevent the redistribution that would come from inflation, because at that point inflation would have been redistributed. and what they were helped with, one, an ideological. into the idea of sound money as a metaphysical reality as opposed to just a contingency, and two, the fact that the British fucking pound was gold backed, and the British trade system depended on, discipline towards gold, and would punish countries that printed too much money. So that's why I think ideally. so here's my ideal situation somebody said what's the ideal uh oh boy i'm cooking now okay cap this boys girls if there are any somebody said what's the best uh um person to succeed lincoln and uh i've of course said in the past about how awesome it would have been if benjamin butler succeeded lincoln but the main reason i think butler would be number one is not because i think he would have stewarted us to some sort of peaceful solution, hot poppy cock, no way, the the whole half second half of the 19th century is going to be blood bath, like it was in our timeline, but it was a blood bath that resulted in the domination of a capitalist state. Benjamin Butler gets in there, our our uh crooked Massachusetts machine hack, this this fucking... boss tweed motherfucker who made his bones kissing the assess of irish textile workers uh in Massachusetts who bought his commission into the US army by uh by he bought a uh a textile factory and then uh made them the soul supplier of uniforms for the uh troops that were raised in by the Massachusetts militas or by the mass by the state of mass buse the states did the actual mobilization in the in the uh the war began and he was like, if you guys want these uniforms, you got to make me a general, so he and he was a terrible general, but he was viddictive against the south, he was a demagogue in every way, but if he'd been in there, you have a demagogory matrix that tells you to, back the former slaves in the south, they will be your guys, they will they will they will owe their freedom and their prosperity to you, ally them with the poor whites, at the expense of the defeated. federates, we have power, we can crush them everybody said we couldn't crush them was operating off some liberal Carl Shures bullshit that fucking Benjamin butler did not believe it, now of course doing that, waging what amounts to sort of a quasai, a class war disguised in a race war on in the south is going to have reactions in the north, how you going to deal with that, how you going to deal with the fact that you've got all these uh, all these uh immigrant workers in the big cities of the north who hate you, who hate blacks, who hate the republican party who resisted constription, rioted to prevent it, how are you going to defeat the combined might of like uh American capital and of course the reactionary small holders of the mid-west with these guys at your uh stabbing you in the back uh how about you decide to go to war with England which has the added benefit of dealing with the uh being under the sway of the uh English pound. So Butler goes to war in the south with the old confederate uh leadership and the land owners and then goes to war on behalf of his uh of his potential uh clients in the American machine uh democratic cities that he come came out of goes to war with the fuck. British and breaks the anglo stranglehold on the global world system right then and there, and then in those conditions of war, continued war, the opponents to Butler's rule, among the ruling elites are defeated, now of course that only creates a tinpot dictatorship, the kind of things that the kind of thing that the... uh that the defenders of liberalism were horrified by, and if this was all you get would have been vindicated by, but even in this situation, class conflict continues, no dictatorship is able to contain it, which means that this new uh, this new political organism that comprises the lowest tier of Americans. uh could coherently take power as opposed to what happened in our country where they were all defeated in pieces, the immigrants, the landless whites and the former slaves, of course this is a whim and a fancy, but it's fun to think about, that's why there's all those damn video games people have. uh, somebody says is there going to be a hell on earth civil war, the US civil warpod, not by itself, but i we are toying with the idea of after the seven years war thing, doing a uh history of the mid-19th century paroximum, like when capitalism awakens, like, yes, it's taking power in places before that, but the period from the war, the 148, the 1848 revolt to the end of say the taiping rebellion, and the establishment of like the rage, is when capitalism genuinely arrives everywhere, and the mark of that is this chain of apocalyptic social conflict. that go around the entire globe, the united states civil war would be part of that, but it would not be the only one, talk about rebellion of course, like i said, so yeah, that's that's very ambitious, but we'll see, if we do, if we are happy with the seven years war one, we probably do it, and that is why to me that is the most fascinating period in world history, because you're talking about a world where capitalism at its like mature form as a subjectivity, as an expression of the self through technology is confronting social worlds that are fully enchanted, and like the conflicts are just so breathtaking for that fact, they're charged with this this mysticism a friend of mine, ever. from age of Napoleon, wonderful podcast, once described how just he tried, he was describing how hallucinatory, the Natt turner rebellion is, by saying, you can kind of imagine it as like a national guard unit going up against like a wizard, like Merlin versus uh, you know, Kent State guys, like when when the uh the guys in Afghanistan killed the giant, yeah it is wild that Russia survived, they were uh, they had that dog in. no question, and then they got to come way from the back of the pack to uh unify Germany, like the Hapsburgs couldn't do it, the Widdles Box couldn't do it, it was the fucking Holanns. Who the hell saw that coming from the top rope by just minmaxing uh, a a army build, just putting all your stats in army, because that is when you're behind the eight ball. uh economically that is a leveler because there are uh force multipliers there that aren't directly tied to capitalist production, escape from rome, yeah that's the the earnt the sheidler sheidle book, i can never pronounce the stupid name, highly highly recommend that one, yeah and it's thanks to the prussians that we have the the uh modern uh his humanities, the the western uh, the disciplines, history among them, fucking iron prison of the of prussian design, yeah, Rome set the blueprint correct, like that was the distinguishing feature of the Roman uh polity when they came to power was their ability to uh uh marshall maximumly efficient uh military capacity. the problem is is that that only works in certain conditions and that was the end that was the final tragedy of the Germans is that because they were on the outside line the lane they had to fixate on militarism and it got them to parity and it got them beyond like the Germans started outplacing Britain for industrial output like before World War One, but that was all creating huge uh... build ups of social uh contradiction and tension that a late to the party Germany could not express colonially, it couldn't lance the boil, so it turns out though, the quality, the quantity has a quality all its own, and a uh, the combined might of a of a global empire like the British, will overtime, especially when allied with the... united states will uh eventually defeat all comers no matter how uh much they might focus on a martial social order and martial technologies because at a certain point you know marginal utility evaporates one thing to go up against the declining Austria and a stagnant Russia uh like and and France like yes France uh that's touffy. that's tough, but it's nothing on uh modern military forces that squeeze almost all of the uh access uh all of the uh all the inefficiency out of the system, like you can no longer uh as an underdog gain enough advantage to overcome. just being but just less productive. and so yeah, the United States, it created like a a machine of social violence that was unprecedented, but one of the things that was unprecedented about it is that it's its edges were pointed in in uh interiorly to a much greater degree than they were in any of the other countries, so it's not. like military innovation, it's an entire way to make a a society of anti-social psychopaths. that's why i do wonder about what it would have been like if marx had gone to texas as he and angels thought about doing after the failures of 1848 rebellion, like. if he had seen up close and personal, just how we were transforming uh human behavior, the human spirit, how we were redefining God in the blood meridian, all right, leave you that, have a good time folks.
