 the fuck why is it why is it hosting burning ah there we go they were hosting burning bob is that a is that a gamer of some sort? someone who engages in the deadly mental oninism of gaming, not approved by me, no thank you, although I shouldn't be want to talk, uh, I am essentially a gamer, I mean fundamentally I am a gamer uh, like if you if you if you like trace my you know uh, career trajectory, it is essentially that I gamed so hard that I became a professional gamer, and the game of course being posted. because that's a game, it's got a score, it's got a it's got an object, uh, it's got players, it's got ranks, it has uh emotional stakes, but no real material stakes, that's gaming, it is a sink for one's uh pent up and unused energies, so i guess this is my admission that i am in fact not only a gamer, i am an an gamer. so the election still going on, it's actually the exact nightmare scenario that people were worried about, right? this was the liberal and left-wing from many cases, worry about this election, because of the nature of the ballot collection process, you've got these states where Trump is up on election night, but It's going to take a long time, he's going to declare victory, and he's going to call on his supporters to go out and and and commit it uh, and carry out a coup on his behalf and stop voting, then his judicial goons will back him up, and what is actually happening? Trump is doing everything that everyone said he would do, he's not taking the high road, he is, he is saying the stuff that before the election people said was going to cause a civil war. I want people to go back and run and maybe I even said this buse like I said I didn't realize until I realized you know I hope I didn't I always I think back I thinking back to this stupid issue i feel like I was pretty consistent that I thought this was all fucking horse shit but maybe I like was I even I feel like at this point if I gave it any credit I feel like I oversold the case but honestly I felt like I had to give some credit or people just wouldn't listen to you they were like well this is so absurdly ridiculous to think this isn't a real threat that we don't live in this country. with the fascist police state and and the proud boys and the nazis in the street, you can't tell me that there is a real th and so i felt like i had to fucking like extend just to a a a bone to even like be able to get a conversation going or get people to like listen, but now it's like okay the barn door is closed because this is the scenario, think of someone before on election night he said what if this happens they would say he will do a coo, that's what they would mean or or there'd be some sort of fighting in the streets and blood in the streets would be the number one thing they would say. Okay, they would say violence, how it would come out, they might not say, but they would say violence. What have we actually seen? Where are the proud boys that were told to stand back and stand by. Where are the militas, the three percenters and the oath keepers and the promise keepers and the the patriate prayer boys. Where are they with their guns? The biggest crowds I've seen are a bunch of fucking chuckle-headed uh parrot fuck Jimmy Buffet concert going motherfuckers doing the fuck. fucking YMCA in a parking lot, some guys in fucking uh Pennsylvania just they went there to protest and they broke out a fucking karaoke machine and what is this lay on to? it lays on to a situation where all these issues that we've wrapped so much importance around like this is titanic titanic battles about the future of the of the race are identified as sports phantoms, these people get together, they basically have a tailgate party. and you see videos of some dorks chanting and they're like, this is voter suppression, this and it's like, yeah, sure, the intention is bad, these are people who don't respect you and don't think that you deserve rights and yeah, all that stuff is true, but what is their power to enact their world? what is their power to enact that world? their power to enact that world is is is their vote, and then what else though? what else? what else really? besides posting maybe if they go on facebook. besides amplifying things and getting other people to vote, maybe, what are they doing, being obnoxious to people in viral videos? are they actually applying any power, but on the consumer consumer interact. in society to to make the world more racist, i mean some of them are doing like hate crimes and some of them are doing shootings and once again, that's terrible and awful, but you have to fucking put those things in perspective, or else why aren't you a psychotically tifan crime conservative? because if like one life lost to violence is like evidence we have to drop everything then you're dick chainy things have to be put in perspective, that was how terrorism worked, people in the fucking bush years were saying, my god terrorism, what's the at the end of the day, what's the big deal? people would say, my god, you're saying you would allow a terrorist attack and so it's like, well it wouldn't be ideal, but like if the cost of not having that is the this awful fucking war, like i'm sorry, maybe we take some, they would say, you would that makes sense, but in this case, in this specific instance, no, any violence carried out of the name of politics, we have to orient our entire politics around stopping, and i'm saying that was a big part of whatever the fuck kind of campaign we just saw in the last four years and what did it accomplish, and what was the real enemy because the moment is this, don't be fucking tell me, oh yeah, well you know uh, they they're waiting for their moment, this is the moment, this is literally the scenario that everyone was talking about, this is dip to the tea, everything has gone as they have said, and what has happened, uh, guys like Rupert Murnock said, oh yeah, Arizona's uh for Biden and fuck you, we're not going to reverse the call, what did uh Mitch McConnell say, he said, you know, there is actually a difference between um uh, you know, counting votes after a vote and and getting new votes, i was like, it's just keep counting them, they're all regular votes, what about the fucking federal judiciary that he stacked with his fucking loyalists, one after another these judges are saying this is a fucking bullshit case, and the cases don't even have like a beer, they're too incompetently put together, jared Krishnar literally was like googling how to uh steal election on election night, that's how much planning had gone into this fucking trying to see, hey is there a guy like James Baker, can we find like a a incredibly uh powerful and influence. political fixer who's been uh you know right in the top levels of American politics for 30 fucking years oh shit now all those guys are tired and their dip shit kids are running everything now oh fuck because yes there are millions of crazy trump supporters but their craziness is the way that they're crazy about being a fucking football fan and they'll certainly go out and do things in public to fucking register that fucking uh the belief because that's how you reinforce the emotional connection you have to the idea of yourself. was a fan of something, but are you going to risk your fucking life at the end of the day? because how many, i mean in Europe, it's one thing with the soccer where it's actually very political like in in a cultures where poliit political life actually had some like teeth to it as recently as the world war ii and afterwards um even if it's dissolving now there as well as it is here but what like we have riots sometimes when a team wins but some guys turn over a car that's it there's no huge apocalyptic confrontation with the cops there aren't fucking deaths there isn't any real confrontation with the state, there isn't any kind of ethnic pogram, it's just a spontaneous expression of people's overpent emotional connection to a pseudo event that they are participating in virtually, and that's what they are doing, they're doing what you would do if your team one or lost or i guess waited for a really really long instant replay call, and you you really cared, that's what we're dealing with, and what that means, the good news, people said it was really black pill yesterday, i don't think that's the case, blackpill is some fucking online cope shit like everything else, it's part of the culture of like having an identity and a take that like takes the place of asking yourself what you're going to do about politics, because like i have said, you have to make politics part of your life as a citizen and as a family member and as a friend and as somebody lives in a fucking community and in a country, because you are a human being, but the but the but the actual content of that is determined by your experiences. not a black pill, oh i took the black pill, now i get to game all day, if you're gaming all day, you're deadening the thing in your in your soul that says you should try to make things better, black pill is a it's a pill, it's a fucking it's a zooloft, you're going to have to answer those questions, people say it's black piel because it tells them you can't find it here, and that is a black pill, that's the truest black pail, because you're saying this thing that i have sudo that i have identified with as like a zone of of uh of political participation and engagement and like building my character and ethic as a human being and building real real uh like actions around my reputed mental values that I hold the things that give them texture and reality uh that that cannot provide me with a political meaning well then political meaning doesn't exist by definition because that's the only place you can get it and that's one of the reasons we're in this mess is because people feel that in their guts but it's not fucking true because even if it's not electoral and it might be there will still be something you can do that can turns into politics if enough. people do it, and I know that that's not great, I know that's that sounds like maybe some anarchist bullshit, it really isn't, it's just an acknowledgement that this thing is not the society. I mean, I know that's cliche, it's literally the matrix, but it is, it's like it is the matrix. There's a reason that people love talking about the matrix, because it is just a perfect fucking metaphor for the experience of this, and yet, we have all accepted, it's something like, yeah, I know it's the matrix, but I know it's the matrix, but and I would say that for the last four years I don't blame anyone for thinking, I know, but that's a matrix, but because we didn't know what was working, we did. know what was happening, we only knew that everything was up in the air, we were trying to figure it out, the only way we knew how, which was to consult the only forum, the only public engagement that most of us have, which is the online space, and we went looking for answers and that was the only place we were even, we were only going to be able to find them there, so it was totally made sense to do it, and I think things were learned by doing that, and things were built that had material consequences, but now is the time to recognize what's going on. Okay, there is no, but the good news though is that there is another place that you can try to build zyon, and that means you have to build institutions and you have to find institutions that connect to the people you know and who you have trust with and who you could build out with, like say labor unions and things like that, not spontaneous street demonstrations, that's what they're doing right now, that's what everything has been for the past four years. spontaneous personal expressions of an overflowing sense of a need to politically define oneself, driven by the trauma and horror of the living in the moment and feeling like you're a political subject, but our conception of ourself as political subjects is illusory, and so when we go out and we perform political identity through demonstrations, riots, karaoke protests, It is inherently limited by our uh limited ability to recognize um to coordinate action, because without coordination the action does not reverberate out uh upward and and reinforce, it like anything driven kinetically will rehit friction and momentum will be slowed and eventually the fucking the water pours out of the cup and it just drizzles away into the fucking uh drain. and that's like and and those partic eruptions can be very powerful and have short term be like traumatic and involved death and violence and these horrible narratives and real trauma and horror, but they will not, they are not the building blocks that people think they are, they are not the steps in an ascension that people think they are, they are random, they explode, the ripples go out and then the fucking waters still until... another eruption comes out, because none of these are building anything beyond the sedimentary layer that over time might read or tipping point, but I think definitively, I'm sorry, it has not been reached yet, and I think this uh, I think the way this is going, the way this recount is or whatever the hell count is going, the way that. there's just none of the stuff anyone was worried about is coming to pass and the way that we are just sort of suspended in like in aternal uh uh election night i think that we are in for like a weird it's weird i don't know how to put it like we're not going to get an exhilation we're not going to get an exhilation but we're not going to get a any catharsis it's going to be a ruined orgasm just an eternal edging like a a a election day that never ends, but I think because that level of tension can't be sustained, I think the tension will turn into something else, like the emotion can't go away, but it will it will uh mutate, and I think like all that the the the anxiety is turning into something else, because I don't how the hell we see this totally muted response, this non-apocalypse carry come out and happen in front of us and not respond. by lightening up somehow, which is I think why Biden won, honestly, permanent election day, baby, just suspended, because like this was supposed to be the apocalyptic confrontation, we were going to banish evil, or evil was going to roar its head at us, one way or the other, like if you're a conservative or or a liberal, that's what you thought, BLM, antifa will be at your preschool. uh feeding your child hell all meat or uh you know the proud boys will be uh bursting into your uh your local health food store and and making and calling everyone soy-based, you'll be able to do nothing about it. uh, but that's not going to happen, and there's not going to be a uh, you know, you're not going to get your chance, because like I said, both, both urges are inherently sadistic, it's like, yes, you're scared of being punished, but you're also excited about inflicting punishment, so that's that's the the the lure of it, that's like the emotional edge of it that makes it enjoyable, the reason people. do it because obviously you don't have to, and we're gonna have to find a new sort of, I guess we're gonna have to change the channel and switch genras, you know, election day is just going to go on and now it's no longer the uh like the big budget um apocalypse movie, it's no longer the... that we were all in until election night, it's like uh, i don't know, some sort of uh comedy type situation, i don't know, we'll find out, it'll be funny though, it's just going to be this thing, the thing i'm looking forward to is just is hopefully the uh, the the need to like assert culture. I hope that goes away, but honestly I'm a little worried that because that a lot of people aren't going to take the election and mean, wow, there's more racists out there than we think, and so many more minority racists than I thought existed, especially since I didn't think minorities could be racist, oh boy, I might have to go, what we need to do, we need to get rid of all this uh, anti white or anti- minority sentiment, all this uh racism, we need more strided cultural. hectaring for people to not be racist, we're going to have to hit the hit the accelerator, but honestly i feel like without trump to goose people towards that like as you know a market incentive, it's going to win and we're going to see uh some more fun programming as we said i said will said on the show we just recorded to bring it back entourage, the man show, we're going to have all the fun like bushera knuckle headed high jinks, there's going to be no more anxiety cartoons. everyone's going to just sort of get uh get 70s about it like if that was like a like a 60 is that was supposed to be like a 68 you know national anusmarib uh horribilus anus horribilus then biden's going to be like that 70's come down that 70's come down where everybody just turned into hedenists and that means more fun and more fun more entertaining entertainment stuff that doesn't have to that does not stuff that is not marbled with politics like cut with politics to make up for the lack of entertainment value like i think that's what that's the best way to think of political content in uh modern uh art the stuff that you know that the uh game and gate people hate wokeness and culture specifically television programs and stuff like that uh as i have said you know uh as capitalism is is is totally uh uh marketized entertainment as a concept, it is made entertainment materially worse, it's made, it's it's by removing the artistic element of it, it is no, it is not it is less and less every year art, because artistic intent is leveled out with money more and more uh, and that means that it's it's it's pretty, i mean you'll have good stuff, but like the trend line like the fucking rate of profit, there's a reason for that, those things correlate u is going down and that means like if you think of it as uh like you're a butcher and you have these like it's it's the it's the it's the it's the um it's like the golden age is cinema and you've got just this beautiful flank steak and you make it these like porter houses for people they're just like oh my god and there's all this rich deliciousness over the years though your stock your business gets bad you could afford worse uh less and less impressive functions of meat, by the end of it you've got this very disgusting uh uh like ground beef, how are you going to fucking serve this to people, it's rance it, well you cut it with stuff, that there are a number of American cuisines that are basically that like scrapple and uh and getta, the their uh ways to stretch meat to make people uh get uh more of it to to be able to uh get more out of less meat, more food out of less meat and what they cut it with is something that isn't art, but looks like art, and politics is that, politics is experienced as an art because it's experienced as an experience and not as a lived experience as art is, but it does not have the uh individual, like human expression of art, it's it's directed to a very material and cynical end, which means that it cannot speak to like a human a real real authentic human expression, which is what art is, it's an authentic human expression, and so it cannot be art, but it's experienced like art, it's like a it's like high fructose corn syrup to real cane sugar, uh and you throw that in there and you you bulk up the fucking meat and the thing is for all the gamer gate people who are trying to be like yeah exactly if you get rid of it if you got if you pulled out the politics it's not like you get a better fucking burger the shitty meet is still there there's few there's less of it there's nothing to cut it they got to cut it with something and because of demographic friends uh and because of the way that uh the consumer economy is directed towards college educated people because college educated people tend to have more money therefore are the subject of advertising attention has to reflect the politics of those people who you are directing your uh your advertisement stores which is how you have a fucking uh entertainment product in the first place. in the case of television, but like it expresses itself similarly all across, you know, people with college degrees are more likely to be able to send their kids into the arts, etc. etc. and so that means you get more people actually in the business of that doing behaving these opinions, that's not, there's no, there's no conspiracy there, there's no cultural marxists in the in the wings, there isn't a fucking zombie theodore adorno cackling in a graveyard in a Prague uh is just the market forces churning through this thing called art, squeezing all of the possible fucking profit out of it and leaving a charred fucking skeleton, so i haven't looked at the chat in a while, don't look at the chat at all. yesterday, content versus art, exactly, content is, it can have artistic elements to it, but the fact that it's con content means that it's artistic uh, content has been inherently adulterated in a way that not all art is. all artist to an agree, because everything is commercialized, but uh, but that experience of expressing art is commercialized to different degrees and over time it becomes more commercialized, that means it turns into content, the needle goes, it's like if it's if it's art up until here and then it's content over time, stuff tends, and now we're at the point where not everything is, but a lot. is and more and more over time will be, I didn't say it was a dichotomy, I said it was a fucking spectrum, it's not a thing, it is an acclamoration of things with certain tendencies emerging from them, you've got two different. the things that break into, you've got a a trajectory of things over time that break one way or another, and then you have a periodization where before they were this and after that there's something else, that's like the way that the means of production uh change over time, and then the relevant uh social structures that emerge from them, and vice versa, you can't. get me with the false dichotomy thing ever, that's not going to work, that's the beauty of dialectics, nope, degrees, oh boy, trump is speaking at 6:30, i might have to lock. off a little early tonight, i think that's okay, i went a home and 45 minutes last time, so i think it's okay if i go 45 this time, but i think i might have to log on for that, haven't watched him speak in a while, he hasn't sounded good lately, have to have him zuod it up, i actually kind of suspect that he's going to be downbeat, but that'll be funny too. i will say shout out to Trump, because it looks like he's going to get the result he wanted, which was he gets to stop being president without having been branded in his own mind anyway as a guy who lost the presidential election, especially to Joe Biden, because he has convinced himself that it's stolen from him, and more importantly he has convinced the vast majority of people who voted for him that he is right, and so that means he can maintain his position as a guy who gets all the attention of being president and all the imagined positive attention to being president without having to do all the bullshit that he hated doing. so once again this guy, the irony of ironies. Donald Trump is the luckiest man on earth, in the sense that he has pursued single-mindedly a single desire in his entire life and achieved every uh possible. to accomplish with that goal in mind, and he has been miserable the entire time, that is what i have before referred to on this program as the hidonic treadmill, and it's a bitch, and one of the worst things that can happen to someone is to always get what they want, because at some point you have to reflect inward on the fact that getting what you want doesn't work, but if you are focused. enough and narcissistic enough, you could just, you could thread that needle and never have that moment and never not be able to drown that moment out with the blaring television piping the fucking empire carpet jingle into your head while you're fucking ordering the assassination of a - iranian general. i got to say though him just like going we we claim the... like and that's the other part of this that is hilarious because you had yes that this army of the darkness that was going to emerge from the suburbs and just claim the government and i know people say well the cops were the real ones i'm sorry these guys all fucking have pensions they have to have they they are as atomized as we are, they are are reactionary and they have power to club people and they get to like carry out higher levels of violence against the population that guys who have the same opinions and would want to do. that, but they have the same fucking selfish desires as everyone else, they have the same non-existent political imaginary as everybody else, they just want to crack heads and fucking complain about fucking uh minorities in their in their rumpus room, you really think they have visions of some imperium? but the other part of it, the other flips is trump had to actually do the thing, and his idea of doing the thing is exactly what everyone's joke version of it would be, he literally. just tweeted it and expected that to do the job, because that's what his entire presidency has been, because the actual wheels of power have been grinding behind him, the just inexorable pull towards annihilation, the background hum of of neoliberal justisterity, strip mining, the human s the planet and and our species being, and he's just the whole time, and that has been because that's what people talk about, and all he cares about is what people are talking about, because he's watching. television the entire time, he gets to uh solve every problem through tweeting about it, and here is a problem that must be solved, it must be solved through tweeting about it, and that means what, that means that his dumbest accolites like fucking Rudy, and kushner decide we're going to rally the troops, fucking Lou Dobs does exactly what those pants sweaters before the election were terrified was going to happen, he goes on national television and tells the tresen followers to go to the cities and stop the count and and but what about the actual people who have to do something like state legislators or federal judges or anything like that? who's doing what? a guy like Mitch McConnell, what are they doing? They have institutional prerogatives, institutional uh ambitions to transcend the Trump administration. They are part of the deep state. That's the funniest part is that for most of these fucking mega people and almost all honestly of like the... post leftties who think like oh Trump the fucking deep state hates Trump so that means that he's a real threat to them, it's like yeah they don't like him, they would rather have a guy whose motives they can anticipate because they're broadly the errors, which is of like a ruling class self-directing, his is a personal ego, completely unbound by adherence to any norm or project beyond his own validation, and that's not ideal. now you need him, you need him, you can't win without him. and now the people who make up a big bulk of the of of the voters and a lot of the people in power have an ideological connection to him and they they root for him and they take his framing on a lot of issues, but you still would much rather, especially at this point, after you've got what you wanted, four years, federal judiciary completely stack, 63 Supreme Court majority for the next decade, and now my god, this election, the they might keep the senate, and more important than anything, they kept those state legislatures, those ones that they won in the 2012 Freedom caucus uh tea party wave, the ones that were supposed to go back. to the Democrats in the big wave we were going to get for Joe Biden with this huge spike in voter turnout to repudiate the disastrous Trump administration they kept them which means bad maps are going to get worse and it means that the the electoral path for even the neoliberal democratic party to wheel power, let alone any fraction of left-wing voters within it will wink away with time. Why would they want to put any of that jeoppardy for him personally and his network of fucking buffoons and cronies, all of whom are just like you can't even invite them to your office to talk about doing illegal shit because they're going to like steal the fucking uh a paper weight off your desk and hock it for $5, you're going to go and have a secret meeting with them about you, adrenachrome harvesting or something and they try to tell you sell you a time share, you don't need them, and then you got the fact. you've got this rolling crisis that there's nothing in the leal liberal playbook to fix, why wouldn't you want to let the democrats do what you did in 20 20 2008 which was taken on the chin for the failure to reconstruct anything out of the economic collapse, and best of all, there is no direct incentive to you personally as a member of this class of people to help him, because well like the impeachment was a no brainer, no republican or at least other no republican live in Utah was going to vote to impeach Trump because they would have lost their job and they all like their jobs. No one in the important crevaces of republican power over like the electoral legislative judicial system has that threat. None of them are going to personally be blamed for long this happened. My god, they're fucking blaming Fox News. You're off the hook. all of them, by the way, have essentially accepted that he's going to lose by it, I mean, that's the other thing, that's another reason that the civil war idea was never going to happen, because neither side was going to be able to keep up the head of steam about an election being lost, because you know when I think about it as I pick up my ar to go out and like maybe eat lead, some fucking kid with a a spiked uh, some kid with like purple hair, like putting a machetti through my eye, because like you might say, oh they're not going to do that, but like the one that's kind of shit has and to they all think that kind of stuff could happen, what for an election? like i remember when Obama was president, like i would get mad at him, he was on the tv, but like i still had a tv and i liked watching it, and i still do, it's just gonna, it would just eat it away, now if he wins and trump could still win, it will be not because they stopped the count and a bunch of ballots are just invalidated, it'll be because the actual count. requires a recount or there's a a narrow enough discrepancy that they can do actual bush begore shit again and if that happens then that's par for the course. the same way you can't complain that you lost the electoral college because that was baked in that level of voter theft of of election theft is by definition uh baked in because it already happened and you have no excuse and you sure shit can't fucking say that that's a coup. or that we've ended democracy, and nobody will believe you if you say it, and so you'll say it with less and less force as nobody takes that principle seriously, and then you're back into the slog, so really, I think we're going to see this sort of like ease tension, like just sort of prolonged brejnevite shrug towards whatever, that it's not terminal, it's not like I'm saying everything's going to collapse, this could go on for god, oh god, you have no idea how long, at least four years of just like, with either Trump or Biden in there, what becomes of q? that's a very good question, I think there is going to be, if he loses, there's going to be some serious disillusionment. but I think the real hardcore, and this is always what happens when prophecy fails, not everybody sticks, everybody use committed enough sticks, like I was talking about, all these things are in degrees, not every queue person is a rabid queue person, a lot of them and they will... say this when you talk to them and these interviews everyone gives with them, they'll say, look, it's like an astrology basically, like you get up in the morning and you know you read your fucking horoscope, nobody really thinks that shit's true, but it's interesting and you think about it over the course of the day and it like makes you reflect on yourself, and it provides you with like some texture to your social experience, cube here is the same thing, read them in the morning and it's like a fucking horoscope, like be on the lookout for the letter l and uh the number 88 and then you do the course of the day and it's a little entertainment and when that happens like eventually you're just going to move on to Sadoku, for the real heads though, it's going to become a religious thing, and like Trump will be a fucking included noti for them or something or like like the holy he's going to like go to the he's like Trump left Washington in a fucking submarine and left behind the clone so that he could find the holy grail under Antarctica and the submarine, like okay fine, but I think that it will be stripped of specifics and like that ambient que stuff is going to find another pole. if Trump loses, but it will tend to to go towards like in a reactionary like anti uh like a reactionary like socially uh uh hostile direction, that's for sure, but I think that specific contours are gonna, it's going to depend on what's thrown up by history, just like Q was, I will be interested to see. the queue congresswoman does, like is she going to just start calling everybody up for and be like ask them under oath if they eat children, that would be very funny, my guess is now that she's in congress, she's going to settle down, just like the tea party people did, and the funny thing is is people like to say that's proof that like oh yeah, the tea party was a failure, like no, it wasn't, it absolutely reoriented to the de the republican party broadly to the right, which is all it was ever liable to do, that's how these things work, like if the pressure group exerts like an influence that like... over time ratchet affects a a a party in a direction ideologically and creates new new barriers for like for litness tests for candidates which ideologically then cohere onto the actual people who run for office. it's a fucking success. q will do the same thing like these people will change the ideological con uh uh the ideological content of the mind of the average uh congressman and that will have its effect. that's certainly true. we'll see. I would say yes, someone says Glenbeck's Charkboard was Proto, correct, problem with that was that it was not collaborative, it was watching someone play a video game, which isn't as fun as playing the game yourself, and that was the quantum leap forward, that was like the thing that boosted queue and made it so enduring, because oh this is a game you can play yourself, you don't have to watch some guy do the controllers, which is what is fun like you get to do your own blackboard, do the... home game, the bec the glen beck home game, and now he's a fucking loser, totally, totally spent force in american politics, the guy, I mean it was bad enough when he bet when he fucked up on Trump, absolutely, how, I mean, how do you not recognize, how do you not recognize your audience enough to know that that was going to be a bad play, unless he figured and I think correctly that his stick, it's not like he could, like he could not have been pro'. Trump, because Trump was a direct replacement for him, like his figure in politics was, it's like the a fucking sun going supernova, like he's this little planet over here during the Obama years, he was consumed, and he would have been consumed, there was nowhere for him to go, but his attempt to go antimp was a hilarious bit of cope, to try to like pivot away, and it failed, and then he fucking came crawling back, and then that made him the most pathetic of creatures. Uh, somebody as keeps asking me about what I think about custer, which is an odd question, I'll leave it at that because I'm gonna go and uh, and watch this Trump uh talk cuz I want to see the live stuff, like we're like the entertainment. value of Trump is going to win pretty quickly once he's no longer president, and I want to get the last good uh drops of juice. I mean, Custer was a vanglorious buffoon and just a a parody of a human being, which is what uh Mark twain said about Francis Fusten, but it it uh, it tracks for him, but I think it's interesting about custer is that in his role uh, at fighting the Suou. both with washida creek and then finally little bekorne, he was essentially acting as a fucking uh mercenary on behalf of railroad interests, like he was not ordered to do any of that stuff, they he went out there as part of a... a a collaboration to to engage uh the sue in a war that would see them uh thrown out of that territory is a provocation, it's the bad guy all around and he is not a fucking general. all right guys, i'm going to go in, i'm very excited about this, very excited about this talk, see you on the flip.
