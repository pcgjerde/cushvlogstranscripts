 Hello, I'm just uh laying down some fire tracks, I'm plugging in the phone to the laptop, because I've heard that that makes the sound better, especially uh on the YouTube, so hopefully it does, fingers crossed, I'm going to do this from now on and if that works I'll be happy. folks, i'm soy facing, we love to do it, don't we? we love it, i want to kiss you guys, i want to do the soy face, but i kiss you, are the boys, the guys and the girls, many many people told me that at that rally he just was doing my impression of him and not damn it, he they're right, so many people have said that i do a bad impression of Trump, and i'm telling you, i do trump at his most concentrated and condensed, which means once in a while, he's gonna like hit the top of the the meter, you know, he's gonna he's going to um, what's the term? in uh in acoustics when you blow out he's going to blow at the top of the of the of the key and then he's gonna sound like me, then he's gonna go, I want to kiss the guys, I want to kiss him, I want to get the big kiss cuz I'm more, folks, I drank the mercury, I did it, I followed the golden path to the mercury concoction, and now I'm the immortal emperor, folks, we love to see it, I've got an emperor and I've got an army, I've got a beautiful terrakota army. and guess what folks, they're going to rule the world on my behalf, because I'm the emp, the immortal one, and I've got the immortal warriors and guess what guys, I'm going to live forever. Uh, yeah, he literally thinks he's immune now, even though we're not even sure that uh, there's any long-term uh immunity provided by uh infection, because we've already got a buse, I know another months of... so there were spade of reinfection cases in south south Korea that eventually turned out to be uh just failures to have like accurate testing essentially uh like they were they tested it wasn't like it was a it was too false it was like a a positive and a false positive or something like that but um in this case it looks like we've got at least two confirmed recon re uh infections including one of a woman who died i mean she was very old but still uh It's folks, it's not great, it's not great. I do have the tightest busy in the five burrows, so instead of accepting that reality, he is instead concrete to reality where he is immortal now and immune, and his blood could probably be synthesized, and if we could make a trump, people say, how do you get the Trump people to make a uh to take a Trump vaccine or any vaccine? Just say that you made it with Trump's blood. If Trump says that his blood is going into a vaccine everyone. would take it, and you know what, it would probably give us, what would do is, even if it was total placibo, it would essentially re reoriente our way, our understanding of disease and reality to such an extent, that we would actually cure COVID, but what by essentially redefining COVID out of existence, like over time like we would still have the deaths and we would still have the sicknesses, but we would... just break up the apparatus for even recognizing it, which was always the basis for Trump's covid policy, stop, don't test, don't test, cuz you get tests, you get positive results, so you don't want that, and you could make that a reality by simply defining the the disease out of existence, and if you say, well, that's going to lead to things like you, lots of uh people going to the hospital, maybe the capacity won't be there, well one thing is you do is you build, you you direct uh resources to building capacity to deal with these increased deaths, but the increased deaths lose the... urgency of corona, they've urged, they they lose the the patina of of exception, and they reestablish a normal baseline, where now we have x number more deaths a year from this infectious disease, but it is not coronavirus, and that means everyone's back to work, and everybody's back uh, maskless and there's no social distancing, and everybody just lives their lives, with a slightly higher risk of dying or getting a long-term neurological disorder or long term. term glung damage, it just becomes a new normal, the way cancer rates going up over the years is something people accept, hey you're getting older, the price of that is you might get cancer, you know you got older. the price of that is you might get this thing or whatever we're calling it and honestly that's the most realistic thing we could do if we wanted to be pure realists about this moment like we're going to strip everything of morality we're going to strip it of even a like uh recognize even even evaluating from a political perspective like let's say we're not even going to try to ring any political juice out of the failure of covid and say oh look you know COVID is uh covid is capitalism's fault uh we don't want to let capitalism off the hook, but if we recognize that there's nothing elucidating about this moment and that the COVID moment has no revolutionary potential, we could just say, okay, fine, we'll do this, because then at least you could fucking get back to like a functioning system and restart the economy in a meaningful way and deal with like buse otherwise this is an intractical problem, having a system set up that has no capacity to do the things like. scale uh uh uh wide-scale test and tracing capability and lockdown capability, most importantly the kind of things that would be facilitated by a i don't know massive suspension of rent, massive suspension of mortgage payments, complete suspension of all debt collection of any kind, uh mass infusion of direct cash payments to people to obviate the need to engage in the service economy and go outside of the home and allow for large scale lockdowns around areas of infection that were tested rigorously. that would be wonderful, who's going to do that? you think joe biden is going to do that? we're talking about the realistic solution to this, it's just redefining it out of existence and adding it to the perils of life, the way that we went from zero people getting killed every year in car accidents to 50,000 getting killed every year in car accidents, that is a 500, that's a 50,000% increase, i believe. and not and it's not a thing that we think of as a crisis, it's a thing we manage, and it'll be another thing we manage, and of course that will disproportionately fall on the poorest among us, we will least access of healthcare, least able to take off from work, least able to even be aware of this threat, least basically people who are forced by the market to risk their lives more than they previously were. yeah, that's awful. the only thing that's going to prevent that from happening is an intervening political movement, some sort of political. uh uh organization that interrupts this process that puts the fucking broom stick into the spokes of the machine, that's the only thing that's going to stop us from sliding towards that outcome, and of course maybe we get a vaccine, maybe we get a vactine and then everybody can just act like, you know what, guess what, and here's the thing, trump wins, say let's say Trump wins, which not outside of the realm of possibility at all. I'm not going to say in any way Joe Biden has this thing rocked up. I think he'll probably win, but my god, I certainly have more, I would be less, much, much less surprised, I'll admit, I'll be way less surprised if Trump wins than I was that he won the first time, that was genuinely shocking, I'll admit, I was out to lunch like that on that one with a bunch more coastal elites, we weren't enough, close enough to the ground, and if you want to ever own me by saying, you didn't see Trump coming, even though you could listen to us talking about that fucking election and talking herself. over and over again right to the precipice of recognizing that holy shit he is the one of he's the man for this moment, he's going to win this thing, he's the one who makes sense in this context, everything about like if politics is a game show, if politics is a spectacle then he should win, but no, it's not that much of a spectacle yet, there's still a grounding, there's still a reality, there are still fence posts, and now and then we found out, nope, no, no, no, that firmament you thought there was totally rotted away, so i could fully admit that that it could happen again and i'll be way way less. if it does, but man, if Trump wins and then like halfway through his term after you know he like loses in big in this house and senate again and gets impeached again and get and ignores it again, then we get a vaccine and then he like leaves office, he's like this decrepid ball, like this somehow this like dehydrated but also wet sack of like uh ron popeel roticery meat. bright orange just sliding allegenously out of the fucking frents and the wighthouse just go i said it would go away magically i said one day it would be gone and look it is it's gone look it's gone now i said it i said it you heard me say it over and over again then eventually one day like magic you be gone and now it's gone because for trump it is only the moment it is in past does not exist only as a vague memory that you have shaped into a into a fucking mirror of your of a delusional mirror of yourself, putting yourself in in this position of fantastical uh uh command of the moment, but in reality you're a fucking moron is barely aware of what's going on. around here, oh man, they see that apparently Eli Lily was doing trials uh, oh no, Johnson and Johnson, which I was surprised by, I thought they made like soap and shit, I guess they're also a pharmaceutical company, they were doing a trial vaccine and they had to stop the trial because of an unexplained illness or an unexpected illness, either way you don't want to hear that word. before illness and i just thought i am legend, will smith, they create this vaccine that's gonna immunize you from cancer and then cut six months later half the populations are these horrible CGI zombies uh vampires running around and of course there's the question that i don't think anyone has ever answered to my satisfaction but i haven't asked that much i'll admit what about this possibility that just keeps evolving and becomes like the flu where every year there's a new strain, there's a covid-20, there's a COVID-21, there's a CO22 with all different licalities that are like pegged around covid-lothality and require a new vaccine before you've even created one for the original COVID, no I'm sure that that happens all the time, but it was just the word unexpected illness that made me think, oh god we've created a new mutant it's going to take over, it's captain. trips all the time has seasons don't fear the reaper the wind or the summer rain it's so funny that they're doing the stand right before this hit and now they're going to release it hey guys i guess they're thinking that now that everyone is basically decided that it's over even though it's still happening and happening more and more really and that the trend lines are up and that you reaching like early uh outbreak levels of daily infections and deaths now uh which like i said it's just we're all grinding down the emergency in our mind so we can keep going buse we're just sick of sitting here uh we're acting like yeah it's basically gone and now we can look back and like oh wow we're lucky that didn't happen uh now things are great i can do so distance drinks you know in the at the bar at the in front of the bar downtown, which just feels so much like hanging out, you know, it's like this is not a shadow of my former enjoyment and my former social life, this is just the new version of that, because we normalized it into reality, we've manifested it into being. okay, so someone saying that it's stab, more stable than the flu and less likely to do that, that'd be good, that'd be good, all right, that's nice, that means you could actually get a vaccine that... could be that could stamp it out relatively quickly, that's good, and then of course we would look back at that time and learn nothing of any meaning, all we will be is dumber from having lived through it, dumber and deafer, more distracted, more agitated and more kneerk in our reactions and more uh, either plugged out of politics to the point of nialistic self-destruction, or plug into politics to the point of ner just cripplingly neurotic. uh nearly erotic fixation on the ups and downs of the of the spectacle of politics. either way, not in any way better positioned to deal with the horrors of the world around us and the crisis, the continuing and folding crisis. it's like harrison bergeron where you know the smart people are forced to just have like a a a a siren go off next to their head every 10 minutes so that they can't think too uh far ahead before. for getting disrupted, we're all in that, and then we're going to be in worse, worse situation, monopoly capital will be in a vastly better situation because monopoly capital has monopolized the shit taking the opportunity of this, this corruption, this this uh this drop in the economic like the the ex cuz you know one of the things hurting, there's a drive towards monopoly and capitalism, but there's also you know expanding wealth and and and inflation through that which makes it hard. for capital to you know uh subsume others because they're able to grow in relationship to them, but in a situation like this, when you have whole sectors cored out almost overnight, monopoly capital can scoop those up and add them into the fucking board, so we're going to have a more monopolized capitalism than we've had since the rocking Roberbaren days, if we don't already, and it'll be it'll be uh something, a lot of mom and pop shops are going to get turned into like... uh, I was not even something like you, like McDonald's or other things, not even more like they'll still be run by individual families and stuff, but as sort of like an uber'. model like a gig economy for restaurant tours where like you get to be a you get to rent out the the place and gets like a per hour salary with no benefits to like basically run a restaurant instead of actually getting the profits from the restaurant like that would be the new model franchises but where like you're not even the owner like they've already been doing that uh there's a very interesting article a number of years ago now about 7-eleven owners and how uh has essentially proletarianized their ownership in large degree because most because there are these networks of like immigrant networks mostly in India that uh basically hook people who want to move to the United States from India up with franchises when they get there sort of as their stake like as doweries even and that puts them in like sort of a subservient position you know visa v this huge company that can do things like you know schedule uh uh ice raids uh on their own fucking franchises uh if they're thinking of you know asking too many questions uh but they like squeeze the owners to the point where many of them make like $20,00 a year even though they're specifically supposed to be the franchise owns and they'll just wholesale replace the entire you know business model of small restaurants i'd say restaurants and bars number one because those are the ones have been hardest hit uh and then but anything subsidiary to that escape rooms shooting ranges anything, anything that it is a a service or entertainment uh uh recreational industry uh or food or consumption of beverages, anything any of that element of life uh that involves people operating out of like fixed brick and mortar uh positions like fixed capital that's not going to be owned by individuals anymore and that class of petty bourgeois is going to be subsumed into the proletarian class which of course is what the engine of capitalism does, it's separate, you have a bunch of different classes embedded within capitalism, like i have said, there's even pre-capitalist modes sticking in there i, as I have said, am an artisan, that is a pre-capitalist uh uh um class configuration, doesn't exist in doesn't it is not being produced by capitalism like hegemonically now, like it was it was something that had to be subsumed within capitalism and it broken up and largely it's gone, what what used to be artisans are 99 percent of the time their jobs are now proletarianized. I am a remaining artisan, I'm still in there, but the processes there are fewer over time until you grind out and then you've got like things like the small bourgeois, you know, and the PMC, whatever kind of pseudo class you want to pull out of your ass, they will over time be pulled apart, some of the the lucky ones will get pulled up into the ownership class, the the the losers will be pushed down into the working class. the proletariat, and then you end up with just two, and this is going to be furthering that process hugely. the question is whether be whether that's actually helpful to the you know radicalization of the working class, uh, the old idea was it would, because it would create larger and larger concentrations of working class people who shared working class conditions, shared exploitation, shared an understanding of their alienation and the contributors to it and could organize that way, create, become a class, for themselves with a with a... a counter-hegemonic political uh and and cultural uh like engine like they like that's what when the the battle of positions that Gramshi talks about is between capitalist hegemonic cultural uh institutions cultural and and civic institutions and an emergent generated uh working class generated working class generated uh counterculture of its own institutions and like post war Italy is the closest example in the world to that that concept uh because the... communist party during the post war period when it was the official opposition many of the time and was being suppressed by the gladio operation uh had its own civic institutions, its own radio stations, its own media apparatus, its own political leaders, mayors, senators uh and and and uh you know uh cooperative aid organizations uh uh civic organizations, recreational organizations, that's also true of uh the German social democratic party before world war uh before the nazi rise, that's what uh, that's what the concentration of the working class, the pulling of people more and more into the working class does is because there always be more working class people than there are capitalist, which means over time as there are more and more capitalist uh workers relative to capitalist, that counterhegemony becomes stronger, the uh the self-organizational capacity of the working class as such gets greater, and then eventually you're able to through the force of arms and and uh persuasion, any element that comes along with being both most numerous and most organized, it can't be one or the other, if you're organized without numbers, you will be crushed, if you have numbers, but there is no sufficient organization along sufficient concepts, which comes from creating institutions, counterhegemonic institutions, that's the durability uh that allows you to like point your movement in the right direction, to find the crack and the fisure of capitalism and drive into it, that's you need that, and the problem is is that while we are we are seeing before our eyes that this process of of stripping all class character down to just two defining categories is happening and accelerating, there is no concomminant. rise of working class self-conscious counter hegemonic uh uh institutions uh and culture and that's because of the effect that the process of social atomization, suburbanization, racial polarization and nationalism have done to and then compounded and compounded and quadruple compounded and and compounded. beyond words compounded into the brain of a supercomputer, the fucking internet on top of all of that, that's led to a situation where even though more and more people are turning into working class, they're not thinking of themselves as working class, they're just thinking of themselves as someone fallen from a natural social position, that's the full phenomenon of like the PMC who don't actually make money right, somebody who is not driving in the, accredited world where you you learn from your middle class parents that you get a college education and that allows you a certain social standing uh self-conception and salary and you don't get the salary but you still think of yourself as you still think of yourself first and foremost as part of that class, that cultural class of college educated uh people who are urbane and cosmopolitan and value you know social inclusion as and ends into themselves. the the refinements that come from accrediting oneself to the bourgeois morality that lake capitalism demands. even though they are now functionally, more and more of them actually working class in the relationship to capitalism, they are, nonetheless, not imagining themselves that way. and look at think of those trump supporting uh non-college educated white men who are his base, who are his fucking uh mujhadin? his his uh, his fedin warriors, his his his 300 Spartans, lot, some of them are uh, some of them are of course, you know, just racists, right? a lot of them are just like, I like racism, but a lot of the reason that they're racist is because in America race is only really uh examined critically if you're white. through the crusable of that bourgeois accreditation into middle-class morality, like that is really the only interaction a white person in America gets socially, forget the television and all the stuff you see on the globalist media, in reality what really brings you towards these not, not like lived values, I'm talking just things in your head, things that cost nothing to feel like white guilt and fight white privilege and and like the idea of white supremacy, like it does, and and your need to fight it and things like that, sense of uh white responsibility for uh the position of of African-Americans in his country uh like that's the specific shit you get from going to fucking college so some of it is just racehate but other of it is misdirected rage due to the fact that uh you're even relative to the working the rest of like you're in a working class even relative to your older generations before you or other people you see around you culture and on the television, your life is getting worse and worse, but you don't know how to define that, you can't define it, because no one is talking to you from the other level, all media is the fucking people who went to college talking to each other, and everyone else is just drowning, and they're just sitting on top of this drowning barge going, oh it's so sad they can't, they can't free themselves and they're yelling into the in across this casm, but it's all it's all loaded with contempt and it's all loaded with like the alienness like you're essentially talking to people who you don't understand, you're condescending, even with the best of intentions, and you combine that with the fact that there's no lived reality of class in this country, people don't live class, especially in the gig economy world where people aren't working in those conditions of like a factory line, i mean even like i'd say our best hope for mass organization in this country are to play few places where people do work together like big box retailers or amazon fulfillment centers, those are and there are still fac'. hustling, they all turned us into lumping proletarians even though we have jobs, and the thing is like so, i think people argue over these questions and it's like at every point you can see how the category confusion is happening and how they're basically don't really even disagree, they just have decided that arguing over this constitutes some sort of meaningful engagement. for them or recreation or a combination of the two, but man, it just if you pull this apart, there's just there's no resolving it either way, like this is a real uh, this is a real conflict, oh and also i forgot, there's another section of the non-college trump supporters who are the boat beautiful boat people, buse yes there are a lot of upper uh like and what those people are are i'm saying it's like the class is getting pulled like the fucking velcro is getting well some get pulled down, some get pulled up and they're getting pulled up, and that's and that's and the reason they're voting for Trump is because that's a class interest for them, all the cultural stuff is just gravy, and the reason they both feel that way is because we are culturally segregated, our culture does not, we and we live it through much more through the prism of race than through class. and as I've said a million times, the only hope we have is that the conditions as they evolve will will provide opportunities for us to grab in front of us the possibility of reversing these trends and grabbing people together and having them pull in the same direction to interdict with the slide we having towards the total monopoly domination and I don't think it's lost, I don't think we're doomed. I just think that we have to accept that we're at a more basic level, fighting at a more basic level. than a lot of us want to be, because the implication of that is that man, we have so far to go, but acceptance is the first step towards moving forward, and i feel like a lot of us are just fighting through this coubler cycle, like we stay in the discourse and fight it because we're fighting that eventual inevitable realization that these fights are for no good reason and then we will when human voices wake us human voices, i did not hear the miss rebel thing from John brow, i was watching it, i had the s titles on, she said, if those rebels find out about that, you'll get hanged, she was talking to Missouri red shirts, ruphians, were essentially almost all of them deputized into various militias uh that were part of the United States government's recognized territorial legislature in Kansas, how were they rebels? Who were they rebelling against? I've not read under the volcano, I've heard it's good though. the chat is full of artisans i'm sure no they were not called rebels why would they have been called rebels they were called border ruffians generally that was what they were called and uh in like the press and stuff the there was also like a a political movement that was like called the party of law and order. but nobody called them rebels, they weren't rebelling against anyone, they were enforcing, they were enforcing what was the closest thing to legitimate uh monopoly of violence in the Kansas territory according to uncle Sam, and the reason that matters is because to misstate that is to misstate the position that brown found himself in and the need to transgress to need to break out of the strategic uh stalemate that had arisen where neither side was willing to take the next step which overtime benefited the the over the the larger political momentum behind uh the the uh slave uh state coalition there, the Missouri, the Missouri faction, the ones who ended up writing the Lecompton constitution, even though their election was invalidated and they were not a recognized government, they still fucking passed and demanded that that Congress approved. a constitution that accepted slavery as the law of the land of the Newsas state, and it was whether or not the democratic party would support that constitution that led to the... southern democrats walking out uh at the uh convention in Baltimore in 1860 uh which led to the northern democrats nominating the remaining northern democrats nominating Stephen Douglas uh the southern democrats nominating for themselves John Breckenridge uh some some radical centrists around in the Clay tradition uh put a guy named uh John Bell uh as the compromise can't we all get along. candidate the cuck and it was all over the lacompton constitution because that was the bridge that was too far even for the dough faces cuz Stephen Douglas was by any respect he was the next logical guy in line after Frank David Pierce and Bricanon, he was the most prominent congressional dough face, the guy who fought Lincoln in the famous Lincoln Douglas debates over the issue primarily of slavery and his vehement defense of it, and defense of the... planter uh uh prerogative and even foreign policy, but the thing is is that around Stephen Douglas, northern sentiment changed, it was no longer impossible in the north to say, just give it to him, like it used to be, because even northern democrats, the guys who mostly said, leave slavery alone, I care about the banks, I care about the dang banks and I care about uh revenuers and I don't give a shit about what these dainty doily motherfuckers, these these quaker weird. uh in Boston, these these these homos say about slavery, what's it got to do with me, do you want these those black people up in here, I don't, you know, whatever, but they saw slavery as a threat, the more they saw slavery as a competing threat to them, a competitive economic system that could realistically put them in a position to lose their market power, either as a farmer or as a laborer of any kind, because they'd be competing with literal free labor, they said, nope, this is a bridge too far, because the lacomtin constitution was, if they accept this, then Kansas is a slave state in the union with two new senators, breaking the balance in the senate, and meaning with the democratic president, because democrats had a lock on college at that point, especially with the wigs and ploting and the de republicans, this brand new party that just emerged that only had one presidential candidate uh to its to its credit, the... the adventurist uh uh self-promoter John C Friemont, they had to go with a celebrity just to get people attention, but boom, second time they have this, it's still not, it's still would have fallen to a unified republican party, or a unified democratic party, and that unified democratic party would then be voting to mean to put slavery in every state, and once it's in every state that surrounds the north, how long before it has to be introduced there to keep moving. to keep to keep pushing forward to keep allowing a new area for slavers to import slaves and uh and uh create a new market that creates demand for old older slaves, older lines of slaves by by 1860 most northern uh Virginia, the Virginia slave trade was mostly uh about breeding and selling slaves down to the the big cotton plantations in the south because that that tide water had been sort of already. uh farmed out by the over uh aggressive uh farming of cash crops like tobacco, but you had this huge human capital stock that had to go somewhere, and if you forec that that if you draw the the if you end that process of expansion, that's the end of the fucking system over time, and they understood that, which is why they push forward, but northern whites understood it too, and they didn't want to be competing, and so even Douglas had to draw a line at Lecomptton and that helped lead to Lincoln winning and that then guarantee the civil war and so it was the Kansas War more than anything that sharpened the sectional crisis to the to the breaking point which needed to happen for slavery to end and what did it it was Kansas and then Harper Sparin and I'm just saying that that means if that strategic context where you go from a... situation where it looks like slavery is about to get ready to just chomp on and get its jaws around the neck of free labor in the north to the hinge reversing and then the final confrontation which leads inevitably thanks to the superior industrial capacity and population and organizational abilities of the north to northern victory and to the end of slavery as it had to be and the funny thing is is that you you could really argue that the civil war is essentially a uh the final, it's the war between the federalists and the jeffersonians in its final form, like if you if you if you if you want to like if you look at it as an ideological conflict, like forgetting the fact that this is all just a cultural description for a material process, which is the development of parallel uh economic systems, plantation-based agriculture in the south, slavery based agriculture in the south and free labor and small holding in the north or free manufacturing labor and small holding yoman farmery in the north, they produce completely competing in different cultures, the fact that uh that the majority of the... of northern uh of the northern states was um made up of small holders who lived on their own land and farmed their own land right? it meant that they created uh uh they also were able to uh produce produc uh uh um surplus produce they would be able to most of them if they were successful and there was a lot of the northern land wasn't rich enough to do big plantation agriculture especially in New England but there was enough land that individual smallholders could farm enough food to sustain their families and then surplus to sell and what would they do? they would essentially exchange surplus crops for finished mechanical and material items like pieces of clothing, uh, manufactured items, things for the farm, industrial, the basis of an industrial uh economy basically, and that transmission belt created a civic society around it. now in the south the the the proletariat largely was... enslaved labor who produced only enough food for themselves, like plantations had uh like all slaves had to essentially they were their own yowen in that they they farmed and they contributed to the farming of the food that fed themselves, but otherwise they spent all of their time uh uh working for the plantation owner, meaning that there is no surplus for them to exchange in the cities for finished products, so the demand that created like those two competing philosophies of government that emerged from the reality of the end of the American revolution was now reduced to a real proposition because of the fate of. because of the fact that there was so much rich soil that allowed for the creation of these vast profitable uh uh agricultural operations that could create huge surplus amounts of um of cash crops that could provide the material basis for also for formulating industrial capitalism in northern united states and also great Britain provides the fuel for the capitalist machine uh they had like all those linen and in Manchester were spinning for a lot of the part of it slave linen, slave, slave cotton, and the because the Jefferson like the Jeffersonian idea of American liberty that we live with is essentially the idea of living as a farmer, now Jefferson thought he met small yoman farmers, but in reality that's not uh, that's not possible. without creating cities, like you can't have yoman farmery the way they hit in the north without creating the urban culture and urban infrastructure of things like banking and finance and like like abstracted uh you know essentially intensified capitalist productive relationships, those things are united, you can only have continuing agricultural life if uh there is no no excess, no surplus built up and the way to do that is through slavery because he is imagining agrarian life through the lens of a slave owner, not a yoman, he was a slave owner, not a yoman, so when he he idolized urban life, he was idolizing his experience, now because the fact people like him were the people who made up the uh political aristocracy, the leadership of the new country in the south, over time their institutions became the institutions of jefferson democracy, meanwile in the north, the absence of of large tracts of rich land that could accommodate slave agriculture, fact that the relatively rocky soil of the north was more conducive to um to small holding peasantry, also the new territories of the north, even if they were richer in land were also more deeply uh filled with native Americans who had to be contended with, and much more uh, would require much more investment just clear for large, any kind of large scale culture at all, it was largely wilderness uh, so those two modes come into conflict in the civil war, finally, they cannot be. and then instead of recognizing and then when the problem is is that of course that victory by northern capitalism. would eventually result in a synthesis between the two, it's not going to be the just the destruction of the one, that's impossible. the problem is is that the new thing we created because of the results of reconstruction specifically uh, was misshaping essentially, it's historical form bent that jeffersonian model of endless expansionary uh freedom uh maintain and now sits un applely in in in conjunction with like this uh attempt to build something like a rationalized you know uh social democratic capitalist edifist uh it's it's a bummer man it's a real bummer but the whole point is that those those crisis moments are they're fluid and we had bad we had a bad run of things like Lincoln getting shot was very bad you know I don't how much better things would be if he hadn't died but man I i i'm willing to say they would have been in some way better, which at this point a little bit could go along way the way things ricoche, you know, the way things amplify over time and space, uh, it's a bummer though, but yes, like the entire American conception of freedom was jefferson's idea of limitless uh farming, like the idea that you don't have to have all that icky complicated stuff, that's socially uh, that's stuff that requires you to subsume yourself into a social collective, you know, even if it's like we can say that uh that it's this isn't, we're not talking about socialism, we're talking about capitalist market exchange, yes, but capitalist market exchange remember is more progressive than what is Jefferson's essentially feudal worldview, and so he gets this feutilized capitalism because you know it was a part of capitalism, slave agriculture was part of capitalism, all those fucking big uh um, all those huge plantations in the south were powered were fueled by finance capital, they were all mortgage to the hill, they were all financial instruments, they sold fucking stock, they were integrated into every level of the of the world, the burjening world uh um capitalist economy, but they had this this feudal remnant structure based around these uh jeffersonian ideas and we did not crush enough that idea of American liberty uh when the north when the civil war, that was the main f not crushing it enough uh and i think like i said it wouldn't have been fully crushed because you don't do that, there was always going to be a a some level of accommodation that leads to a synthetic thing, not not just the dominance of one, that's a dialectical, that's that's that's basic, you can't argue otherwise, but you we certainly would be could be in a different position visa, that idea, and really i think the real the the dagger in the heart to the to our progress has been... that the constitution itself was not destroyed, because the constitution was what got us into that fucking mess in the first place, and the same way that the articles of confederation reached a point where they were no longer sustainable, and we started over from scratch, the civil war should have been the thing that had a start over from scratch on a governing document, which would have put us on, yes still capitalist, but on a track towards an actual industrial capitalism that had a like a social... relationship at its base that accepted liberal subjectivity, which is equal subjectivity, which would have removed racism as a bad as a mystifying and socially uh atomizing and um and counter revolutionary force in American life, and so the fact that we're still dealing with the constitution, it's still this news on our neck, it really is the thing that moment stands out as as the thing that warped our behavior, we're like a bound. foot from a manchu you know bedmaiden, it's uh, it's a bummer, and would have made miracles happen, my god, i'm just saying we would be in a better position now than we are, that's all i'm saying, how much better, i don't know, i'm just saying we'd be in a better position, we would not have Trump as president, we would not be in this specific dilemma, i think we would have more of durable and and vibrant working class institutions in this country, we would have a more left-wing uh uh government, even if things had gotten worse after the seven, even if like even if you have the same like basic structure of a post war boom followed by a collapse of the world order and then a reorientation around like global finance capitalism that led to the end of American uh industrial dominance and its replacement in the supply chain with uh cheaper labor in the emerging east and the America becoming instead the buyer of last resort, the the surplus absorber within the capitalist system to uh you know maintain its its military might out overseas and provide like the mouth at the center of it to absorb all uh surplus uh production to to regulate exchange? even if that had happened we would be in a better position. we'd probably have universal healthcare. let me just say that. we would probably fucking have it, and we would not be in the situation where we are essentially biting our brains out of our head as a culture and driving ourselves insane because of our civic belief in freedom coming from this freakish perverted, bewigged uh arist. ass fucking uh slave owner Thomas fucking jefferson like the fact is is that when we reach back to all right like was cherished American ideas of freedom they don't belong to like medieval peasants uh in Europe anyway when when people think of freedom obviously more and more they're thinking in terms of as american freedom, freedom to consume, the freedom of the freedom of the market, sure, but at the base of that, they also have a folk understanding of freedom that flows from the pesant peasant solidarity that came before capitalism because these things don't go away, they echo, the the the nightmares of all dead generations lay on the brain of the living. We on the other hand, when we think of freedom, even I think on the left, we end up at Jeffersonian, freedom to expand, freedom, because that's the thing about Jeffer, the Jeffersonian idea, and the reason that it foundered finally on its inability to expand itself, because it cannot be stabilized within a system, it demands always, it can only compensate with more, because you're not giving people a social structure, the hostility, the hostility to the state at the center of... is the hostility to being integrated into a social situation. you're saying, the fact that i unlike my peasant or aristocratic European forefers were bound by superstition and and and and stultifying social conventions in Europe and and and the the vile hand of like Roman papistry or whatever the fuck. now here we can breathe free in the open spaces, but only, but but that means that we have to do it by ourselves. because to participate into to to allow ourselves to be brought into a social relationship is to undermine our freedom of movement and freedom of movement here is defined is the only freedom that matters as opposed to a deeper understanding of freedom as the freedom to freedom uh from fear really and pain that comes with a social uh awareness and and social reciprocal um reciprocal obligation that there is a meaning there and a a a richness. to life that compensates for any narrow reduction of the aperture of like indulgence, and that what that means is that the only answer to social friction in those situations has to be expansion, there can be no resolution because there aren't institutions that people agre upon that can arbitrate distinction, and so it leads all questions have to be answered by expansion, and so at what's what really healed the civil war breach between the north and south, the the the whites of the north and the whites of the south after we decided that we were going to solve the problem, the emergent social problem of emancipation by just reinscribing slavery as much as we could in social form if not in like technically uh economic relationship uh we invaded uh fucking Spain or we invaded Spanish uh Caribbean and fucking Philippines and the Spanish-American war we consecrated that with expansion into... becoming a world power, and then there was some battle within about that, but by the end of World War II, we had the whole world, and then space, we always had this this reach, and it was not until the Iraq war, I think really that the fucking the curtain closed, and now we're turning inward and we're taking this Jeffersonian notion of freedom and individuality and liberty and what it means to be an American and how and how that relates to you, a morality, how being American'. is part of a moral framework that involves christianity, certainly, protestantism, all all that shit, it all flows, uh, but that requires expansion, requires somebody getting some of this pie at every point, because there's no other fun way to reduce social friction, and now how are we going to reduce it, when that is the presiding ideology of government, and we have this fucking new'. around our neck in the form of the US constitution, smothering any chance of us breaking free of of this wild thrashing death as we proox as we paroxim our way through the the fucking coubler. Psycho realizing that our social body must die if it cannot continue to expand. You guys know about um, you know why some of these answers are are purple highlight, I don't know why that is. I got to say as much as I'm sure I'll hate Hamilton and as much as I hate the concept of the whole. thing, I do think if you want to talk hero and villain, if you're talking Hamilton and Jefferson, Jefferson is the bad guy, I'm sorry, and the thing is is that there will always be moments in American history where the Jeffersonian tradition has very worthy exponents who are doing good things to check the rise of horror buying monopoly capitalism, uncheck capitalism, I'm just saying that it was an insufficient antithesis to the thesis of Hamiltonian developmentalism, you know what I mean, or maybe it's because it was the... thesis, it when we never broke through, we never broke over it, because there was always free real estate, always free real estate, free real estate made us in every critical moment able to vent off instead of confront within, because in Europe those fucking kettle started popping because there was nowhere for the pressure to go, in america there was always somewhere for the pressure to go, and to me that's the answer to every question about why America is exceptional, why it didn't have a labor party, it all boils down, however you want to talk about the functions, talk about the fucking social expressions of it, the political expressions of it, it boils down to that law of fucking thermodynamics, so if it's like if you want to broadly go progressive, regressive figure, the progressive figure is Hamilton, the regressive figure is Jefferson, and I would say that just on a personal level, even though Hamilton was a creep and and kind of obviously an arch capitalist psycho uh who... feared and had nothing but fear and disgust for the idea of common man uh was still better than that hypocritical fucking snatnosed - just he's the guy Bozwell talked about when he said why do we hear the the the why why must we hear the loudest bleeding for freedom from the drivers of negros that's who he was talking about fucking jefferson. and the guy immediately even though he had said that the that there should be no you know real formal power for the president and and the executive because oh we got to love that legislature gets in there Louisiana purchase immediately oh what's that your fucking principles don't compart with this thing anymore and the thing that really mattered was expansion because it's the economic engine of the kind of uh warped capitalized uh like agrarian economy that you rated here, inevitably out of your idea, you fucking asshole, we do love John Quince adams, folks, uh, one of our, I mean, you want to talk best presidents, he is in the conversation, once you're passed like Lincoln and FDR, uh, spare, spare moment for JQA, uh, also one of the better men to be president, uh, and a man who recognized the moral, he recognized that. every oath in the constitution and the declaration of independence was going to be worth nothing over time if we made territorial expansion the undergrding uh mechanism of our economy he at the moment he's like this is going to lead us to abandoning everything and it did and it has and look where we are and everything that everybody wants to talk about America and all the good stuff is this schizoprenic uh frankenstein creation of of the of the like echoed emations of a greater horror and a greater uh series of crimes and exploitations and thefts and expcorporations. we didn't, we weren't never made to behave the way that the European states were made to behave. they spent a thousand years smashing against each other to grab grab grab, but god damn it, at some point you realize that there are other forces outside of you, and we never hit that, because the native Americans who resisted our exportation of the continent never were able to here into a meaningful state resistance because they started from such a lower level of uh like surplus economy that they were not able to you cuz you can't do it overnight. it has to be staged and there was no time, especially after you have the initial massive dyeoff from like the essentially un unintentional biological warfare campaign that happened before there was even uh settling in North America, that had a huge impact, and then over time you know uh native populations rather absorbed into the greater system or were pushed out of it, but uh you know disinherited of any uh land and also uh residue of... you know social formation or or I mean institutional formation that you could turn into an actual organized resistance against another state. It was not all intentional, the first farm, the first the first big, I believe it was the first big smallpox uh uh plague in nor in uh, the Mid Atlantic, the one that uh happened right before the uh John Smith showed up, the one uh that allowed them to even like set up there was because some like bask fisherman or something like blew on to Long Island and had an in interaction with like local tribe and then left and that led to something like an 80% die off of the population within within a very short period of time and so of course later on you have intentional like lord jeffrey amhorst and a small plocks blankets but i'm saying is that they didn't even have to try was how lethal they were they were like radioactive fucking berserkers. uh who else are someone asks who are the most American Americans? buse John Brown is one of our most American Americans, PT Barnam, another one of our most American Americans, first name that comes to mine anyway, I'll think of some more, that's a good question, I was gonna like make a book of of. a a Rogue's gallery of like our most condensed Americans along certain axes like representations of certain you know fundamental American uh uh expressions of culture Henry Ford is another good one yes Mark twain also very good very good for sure Donald Trump 100% Joseph Smith. Yes, yeah, no, you guys are all 100%, though that's fire, Andrew Jackson, absolutely, and of course Abraham Lincoln. Elron Harboard, we got to get some women in here, I feel like we're uh, we're doing it, oh Martin Luther King, Pamela Anderson's Canadian, thank you very much. philly slaffly, yes, oh, Hillary Clinton for sure. Jill Maxwell also british, it seems like I'm I'm realizing that yeah when you talk in these terms you're always going to end up being very... heterocis male normative just because so much of a you know our received - my received anyway you know narrative of America is this uh is this public facing you know battle of uh of ideas in a public spair that has been largely uh largely banned largely the domain of man and white ones at that. Amber frost definitely. All right, I've gone about an hour here, I might ask have one more question, ann Hutcher is a good one, good way, good way to end, Ann Hutcher. Who's going to win the world series? the dodgers finally, and it'll be with a fucking astrix, it'll be a fake season, who wants to win this year? i don't, i wouldn't, good, keep it, i don't even want it, forget about it, get it out of here, get it out of my face, bye-bye.
