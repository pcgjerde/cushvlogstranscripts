 not this there, there we go, all right, all right, there we go, excellent, yay, all right, we are all, we are. Bravo for launch here guys, ladies, everyone, hello, uh, so today I'm going to start uh with a couple of topics, uh, not, my check, talk in with you guys, see what you guys want to talk about, but I'm going to start off going off as it were on a few topics, a few things have occurred last couple days that uh, you know, I want to talk about a little bit. just as a uh as an exercise in education for you and me we can like talk our way through these things that have happened and help us make sense of the world with them and of course we're going to start with the story that everyone's talking about uh you know obviously that's pretty hilarious when you consider where we are on the knife's edge of the collapse of capitalism as we know it and a public health crisis the likes of which we've never experienced in the modern era but nothing to do with about any of that, what we can do is have a lot of fun at the expense of once again everyone's favorite uh lace curtain buffoon joe Biden, Joseph Robinette Biden who today on the breakfast club uh went ham as the kids say uh and claimed that if you don't if you vote if you don't vote for Joe Biden then you ain't black which ah just the most perfect morsel of any oh god it's yeah it's a perfect bite uh not so much because he said it you know he's Joe Biden of course he's going to say something like that the whole point of Joe Biden's candidacy is that it represents the same way Trump's does like the end state of it's of the party that he represents in this moment of crisis like the relationship between the republican party and its base is such that by now they have Trump a per reflection of what they want, a perfect embodyment of everything they want out of a president, he's them, he is a peavish, incurious uh, bitter uh um bitter, even though god blessed, angry, even though incredibly fortunate, he he is he represents, he is a perfect representation of the party, because the party is now in a position in a situation where i has got this transparent relationship between its uh its base and its and its political structure. the democrats are the reverse of course because they would have to be, and they have created a situation where nobody gets what they want out of the out of the candidate, how there is no sense of like visiral uh uh um junce so you don't get any fucking of the old uh the old juice they uh like black people got when Obama was president or uh that women were supposed to get Hillary one uh and the the republican old republicans get with Trump this sense of I am validated by the president. This is saying that the democrats now are saying no, no one gets that because we're left with him, because in order to maintain the structure, in order to maintain our interests and in order to deny that there's anything like class or or you know um political or or access to capital having to do with political power, and we're not. going to challenge the existing parameters of that and we're going we have nothing to offer you because what we used to offer you was at least nothing's changing in the post in the in the new neoliberal era nothing's changing but you can get represented you can get some fun just like republicans nothing's changing but our guys are going to get they're going to trigger the libs more and they're going to be more offish they're going to be more like you and they both got that offer but now uh the democrats were forced to pick someone because they couldn't get anyone else, no one else had established a position where they were credible the way Obama was to embody some you know segment of their coalition, they got a guy who maintained loyalty to enough democrats because of their memory of him associated with Obama, so it's it's like a contact high, it's already a second order thing, it's huff, it's smoking the resin, it's it's a desperation move, and now they have to try to sell that. to a general election of uh electorate, which is not nearly the same thing, uh, and that means that their only move, since they cannot offer the thing that their party has offered uh they have this this old mummy who represents no oneho represents the worst in the party from an ideological perspective whose whose record is is everything that these people claim to care about and his record on all accesses of of of intersectional oppression he's bad so what the hell are you supposed to say what are you supposed to think you're supposed to say and think Trump is worse therefore you are morally obligated to vote for Biden. now that was always the the gun to the head of every democratic voter right, but there was always something else too, there was some positive part, there was some some joy to be had in the democratic tent, some sense that you were representing a a a a more progressive social vision, gone now, that's out the window with with Biden, it's purely and only an appeal to negative emotions about Trump, there is nothing else, and because Biden is the transparent embodiment of his parties relationship to their base because of his dementia and his lack of filter, he he is when challenged pushed back to the only real argument he has, i'm not trump, go vote for Trump if you don't like me, he was saying that shit during primaries when people had other options, and now he's saying it in the general, because that's the only only appeal they have, and of course nobody wants to hear that because it really does show you the degree to which they have you completely over a barrel, if you accept the premise, that is, if you accept the premise that Trump, that the republican winning is always the worst outcome, and uh, and that there's like no context in which a republican winning in the short term could lead to anything good, it's all one disaster after another, until somehow we interrupt that by electing a democrat and fixing it, and like wiping the slate clean, i don't how that's supposed to work, uh, but that's that's their whole, that's their claim of how this shit uh goes down, is you've got a republican and we're all terrified of him and you are, were required to vote for him, and but that means is that you can make no claims on them, there is no pressing them forward, there is no being an activist, there is no seeing anything better done because you have no leverage, like Zerlina Maxwell the other day said Biden has to nominate a black woman as VP, and a million people asked her, I don't think she responded, what if he doesn't, what if he doesn't for thelina, because there's no answer, there's no response. someone actually said, uh, I'll be unhappy, uh, I'll I'll vote for Trump, Biden, but I'll do it angrily, you, I mean, the degree to which you have to acknowledge that you don't have a choice is the degree to which you feel powerless in this, and that's bad enough for voters, it's even worse for these fucking opinion uh, columnists and thought leaders and political operatives who are supposed to give the impression and of themselves as having political influence and power, like the whole point that the reason they're in politics is not supposed to be for personal. enhancement right, they're democrats, they're good people, they're politics to help, but they know, but they can't say, I'm voting for Biden because he's better than Trump, and there's nothing that could happen that could change that, emphasizing that, only um, only under my only makes everyone ask the question that bobs did in office space, what is it you do here, what are you for, you have, this the party and the candidate will do what they want, you have no place in this. all you were doing is to justify what they do after they say it and if everyone sees that as your role as just this uh propagandist you lose a lot of credibility or at least they're afraid you they will and so they hate it and so thing like this today is so juicy because they all freak out and they all have to spazz and figure out some sort of justification for why this isn't on its face awful and of course they could the one thing they could say is it's not gonna matter. and the thing is, yes, that's true, that's the hilarious part of all of this, is that the the the truth undergting, even the the harsher truth, undergiding the harsh truth of their hot the fact that they're hostages to biden, is the fact that they don't have any influence in any way, even if it wasn't by, the whole class of people they're squacking are purely ornamental, they're talking to each other and trying to convince us that they have some reason for the... and they do not, but they immediately and instinctively when something like this comes up, get the need to express their actual use, i'm actually useful to this process and i'll express you why, and that requires them to then get the fucking nots to try to explain why what biden said is okay. Why is that fine? I mean, my god, does, as uh, my friend Dan K said, does that mean that uh, that diamond and silk aren't black and Rachel Doll's all is, are we at that level? You you want to make those, you want to, you want to strip race of all uh of all like non uh, you want to strip race of of of everything except just total social signifiers, go for it, but to just say that out loud, in violation of so many carefully constructed uh towers of bullshit that these people have spent years making so that you don't notice, hey maybe this is bullshit, maybe all this uh intersectionality is just getting us more awful. republicans and awful democrats and nothing is getting better, maybe there's no intersecting at all, maybe it's just parallel roads that lead to the fucking shit gutter, maybe we should do something about this, no, no, no, don't you see, no, no, race is a delicate dance, and it needs to be acknowledged at every level, and and we need to intersect it with all these other things, and then you got a guy like biden saying, yeah, black people, hey, look, look up, look black, vote for me, or else you're you're a honky, just... destroys their entire thing, it destroys everything they've done because they have to defend it, they have to defend it, and how do they defend it? there's a bunch of different ways, one guy, I'm going to go through a few tweets here in response to this, because I think it's just all of it is so fucking uh instructive, this isn't a big guy, but I just wanted to point this out for for for like the older boomery Biden supporter, like the real boomers as opposed to the... younger people who are you know they're all on the on the arm, they're all just democratic flack operatives one way or the other. um, but this guy is like, he speaks sort of for the for the older white boomers like Bernie, because they hate uh, Biden's uh, or they hate uh, they hate, they hate Trump because of his uncoothness, the fact that he that he violates all their norms and expectations of what government should be, but look what years has done, look what the years have done. this guy, look at what all those years of uh of beholding the monster of Trump, this is really the niche, this guy is is warning, this is the nichian warning, you know, he fights monsters risks becoming one, if you stare into the abiss to do long, the abis stares back, so this guy says Chris Jackson is his name, and he's a blue check dickhead, uh, and I think like a Trump replier, and he says this, I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Joe Biden is going to be Joe Biden, regardless of what you think. and personally that's why I like him, he's real, he's authentic, and he's gonna he's gone through far too much in his life to give a shit what blue checks say about him on twitter, okay, that is just to a word what people say to defend Trump, I mean identical, that's exactly how people talk about Trump, when the the chlorox thing, every time you said something racist like the the shithole countries, they're saying he's being honest, Trump's honest and he's a real man, okay, and you can't accept that, and I think what these guys saw over the time is that they kept yelling that's not fair at Trump, as he just kept ignoring all the rules and they realize they want to do it too, that's where their joy is going to come from, not ideological, of course, get out of here, they don't care about any of that, not, but now instead of like getting pleasure from denying themselves, those those sweets, those sweet indulgences of politics, they can just gorge. and they're going to go to town and these and they're and at some point all these old white fucking aggrieved idiots are going to realize that they really have nothing uh separating them, they're all the same class, they're all the same broad interests, they all have the same reactionary social view of of younger people basically, at some point they're going to realize what's let's just fucking fuse around one character, one candidate, and then of course, uh my favorite Hannah jones, pilot surprise winner for her work with the 1619 project, which I've talked about on here about how that is the whole premise of that thing from what I understand is Bolone, reading this certainly makes me think my my my instinct on that is correct, and that all those people who fled to defend it uh from guys like James Macfiarson uh, what just because Ben Shapiro said it was bad, that mean it had to have been good, just absolute tribalistic. uh uh reflexiveness, none of it having anything to do with the real questions at hand, very disappointing every time you see it, you hate to see it, uh, so Hannah Hannah Jones, worked on the 1619 project, and is a democrat a proud democrat says, there is a difference between being politically black and being racially black, I am not defending anyone, but we all know this and should stop pretending that we don't, someone replies, what does this mean? she said, if you don't know, it ain't for you, which that is how politics works generally, is you make a political claim, and then when people ask you for more information, you say it's not my job to educate you, uh, and so she the person replies, i'm not the only one that asks, i'm also a black person, to which she replied, yes, i am capable of seeing your avatar, and i will repeat, if you don't understand the difference between being born slash designated a certain race and having taking up a particular set of racial politics, i am not going to educate you here, so obviously like i said, this just destroys all this carefully crafted uh years of talking about how like race is this fundamental aspect of american life right, like this this shit is like like the tanahissi coats thing, you know, the brand, the 1961 project too, the idea that racism is a scarring brand across America that is so inextricably fused with capitalism that it can't be unbroken from it, and that therefore, you know, basically uh, racism is as defeatable as capitalism, which if capitalism isn't defeitable because of the racism, I guess you just have to live with it, but maybe you can reduce the racial part, capitalism you can't really do anything about. so obviously that's part of it uh, but so that all goes out the window, all that goes out the window, that thing that they spent all this years that she want to pull a surprise writing about out the window, it's gone now, this invalidates the entire thing, because if if if if race and politics are that broke breakable apart, then race is not the indellable daily mutant scarring and punishing and traumatizing element that drives all uh white and black people apart and means that they can never really come together and that therefore uh racism can never really be overcome just like capitalism can't only mitigated just stroy it's gone blew blew it over in one second why not to make sure that biden gets reelected or gets elected it's not going to matter nothing she says is going to matter at the level of a fucking candidacy. this laid out, this far for the election, no, it's to preserve her place pace in the hierarchy, because people are going to say, you like this biden guy, you also are supposed to be a racism expert, what do you think what he said, you you can't say he is, i condemn him because you can't not vote for him, oops, so all you can do is say it actually wasn't bad, and so the first thing that comes to mind, regardless of how it conflicts with everything else, she believes and everything else she's ever written, but first thing that comes to mind, just to save your ass a little bit, and then she ended up deleting it, so it didn't even work, the wicked flee when none pursueth, it's really funny, uh, but they did all that, uh, they destroyed their entire project, their entire attempt at like reifying ne'. linked and metaphysically connected to to racism, meaning you cannot address class in anyway, because that's not addressing race, because class means people other than the affected racial group, therefore by definition, you cannot talk about class and race at the same time, it can only be race or class, and so destroyed the whole thing. I mean it's goddamn beyond everything at tom for a one second reprieve from judgment that didn't even work uh it's it's pretty stunning uh it's crazy world they got to sell tickets hell i'd buy one and then there's my favorite doctor jason johnson uh the fo Berty broes uh, another fucking hack idiot who goes onbc to to say that Bernie wasn't intersectional enough or whatever the fuck says just a thought, how about we listen to the entire Joe Biden interview with Charlomey the God before we start roasting him, a white man telling a black man who isn't isn't racist, isn't black, isn't excusable, but what led to that exchange and why Biden was triggered matters as well, well then it is excusable right, buse if it's inexcusable then nothing can mitigate. that's what inexcusable means that there is no situation that could mitigate the fact of the inexcusableness, if if Biden's triggering the idea of Biden being triggered, obviously hilarious uh, couldn't defect that, so it's excusable, you're excusing it, in fact you are excusing it by bringing it up, because it's not like this is this is like a piece of shattered found in a fucking the planes of ninova or something, it's a goddamn interview that happened fucking five minutes before he said that you could look at the tape, so that means that just say hey. I didn't say anything was a killing blow. I mean, nothing's going to change in any of these or for any of these people. That's not part of this. This is all just about making sense of things in my head so that I don't go crazy and hopefully having other people like tell me made to the degree of which I'm not. If it's changing anything. It's certainly not going to change any of their views. Their views aren't determined by reasonable uh dialogue. They're determined by social hierarchy. and then the main the need to maintain it, that's not something you can argue against, so what's the point? it's just me talking to myself literally. so all of them, all of these people have spent years and years and years cultivating their expertise uh to us, the great unwashed. as speakers on all issues of of social trauma and justice along racial lines, along gender lines, have decided in the last three months that none of it matters, that it's all bullshit, they don't believe a word of it, uh, because they are in a relationship with the democratic party where their fortunes and it is are inextricably linked and their interests are fused at the level of its uh, class project, it mean furthering oligarchy, that's what the democratic party is for, and they have decided that their role is to be couriers of that, and and if that's the extent, they're lashed to the mask and they're going down with the ship, and all that's left for them to do is reassure each other that no, we're not all sell out morons, no, no, we're principled smart people, and here is the proof. and along those lines another thing happened just a few days ago on the twitters on the twittering machine that speaks to this exact same phenomenon. i'm talking about the whole giatolentino thing about her parents being human trafficers. uh, i'm not going to talk really that much about the case. it's not her fault what her parents are did. now the fact that she wrote about her parents in part of her memoir that's about herself and her, you know, her struggle with America's systems of oppression, she painted them as hard as... grabble uh uh immigrants uh, not as human traffickers even though they did the human trafficking already at that point, that's an emission so huge that it's a lie basically, I'm sorry uh, so then that's why when this comes up again, she feels the need to backfill and explain their behavior, because she she had the moment where she could have said my parents were human traffickers and she could have dealt with it, but it would have made it harder for her to ingraciate herself to her memoir audience and to the people who read her fucking articles in the New Yorker, so she just decided to skip all that awful awkward stuff, that painful stuff that it's so painful to write about, and so that's it, it's like people say why did she even say anything, she has to, she already staked her reputation on her virtue and the virtue she inherited from her family, that's what happens when you make your your career as an as a as a writer about you as a person, you're fucked, you cannot have a reasoned view of it, you can't uh take the jondiced eye because you've already uh decided that you're going to take a cheat code instead of engaging at the level of pros or insight you're going to do pure personal uh um uh uh ingratiation and that means your parents can't be human traffickers because then it's like wait a minute aren't you just another snatnose rich kid of privilege and exploitation who's now what probably got her parents paying for her uh loft in New York. so that she can play carry Bradshaw, why should i listen to you? but anyway, the thing that was most interesting and most baffling and horrifying to watch and just shameful, was not her whole thing attempting to to defend her parents, it was the instantaneous and overwhelming flood of fellow writers at every level of media, not just the general media, but the left media as well, essentially everybody on the current affairs mass head got into the back uh the got into the... cuddle puddle of of uh of reassurance to her that it's okay, it's so bad that you all even had to write this. oh, the person whose entire career is writing about her life uh, has to write about her parents criminality, wow, i can't believe they the nerve, how dare anyone ask this of someone when that's their entire fucking uh value add as a goddamn media figure, and but they weren't doing this for her, of course, most of them don't know. I mean some of them do, it's a very tight club, it's very chummy, but most of them don't know her personally, what they know about her though is that one she's one of them, meaning she's a media person, and that means two things, two: uh, that means she's a media person, which means one, she could do something for them in their careers at some point, if they're if they have, if they have enough funage on twitter, maybe there's a dm, hey, you know, could you show an editor this? so at that level, just to maintain a friendly relations and like score good person points with a person who they could later use. the other being that hey, i want to make sure everyone has my back when it turns out, when everyone finds out that my parents were? owners, because they all have family that are slave owners, because they only get to write like that because they're all fucking rich kids, there are a few, of course the exceptions, but the meritocracy broke a long ago and it became a system for reproducing the meritoc, they turned the meritocratic positions that people established in in the earlier 20th century and turn them now into aristocratic signatures and so all these people are just rich people's kids uh writing about it to each other and so they know that people find just like the slave guy how many people came out of the woodwork when that guy is paper about yeah my family own a slave uh then i had the slave eventually i decided to pay her minimum wage i felt kind of bad about it oh now i'm going to die so you can't uh drag me how many people came out of the woodwork to say this is more complicated than it looks uh really why well you know in my family okay never mind you're another global oligarch just because you're not from the united states just because you're a different race doesn't mean you're not part of a global uh uh 1% of willful, knowledgeable exploiters and arbitragers of human misery, and just the fact that like oh, i i dealt with anti-asian racism in school or whatever, it's like yeah that sucks, but you still are in a position wildly exulted beyond the average American, and not because you were, you know what, with all that racism, and I'm still uh pretty popular, wow, that must mean I'm really talented, no, no, no, the millions and millions of dollars of your wealthy fucking parasite. family helped, but you can't mention that, none of them want to mention that, because they're all, almost all of them are part of it, and the ones part of it, they need those jobs, so they're not going to stop kissing ass, so that means everyone has an has a a in the front of their mind motive to kiss her ass and tell her it's okay, and the and just like with the biden thing, the length people went to destroy any uh pretence. they actually believed any of the socialist bullshit that they've been mouthing for the last four years cuuse it's trendy online, every defense that they mustered of her is one that's been musstered against criminal scum fucks in every fucking walk of life uh how a number of people said well it couldn't have been that bad because uh they were they pled down and uh didn't serve any jail time yeah because they were fucking rich have any don't you people talk about how all the time about how rich people have different just you don't think that might be more operative to these millionaires getting a fucking slap on the wrist? i mean, otherwise how do you explain it? because the explanation is, oh, they were targeted by the racist ice and bush administration, class, just classic racism, until the case couldn't sustain itself anymore, ah darn it, really, they didn't plee down to a better deal like every other rich scumbag does when they get caught because they have good lawyers, you wouldn't accept that answer in a for a second, anybody else, if that was Michael Tracy's family, you wouldn't accept that, you wouldn't say you, the police are the ones to said this, and what are laws? you only extend that benefit to somebody who you think can help you, in some way down the line, and that means you didn't believe in any of this stuff, you never believed in it for a second, it was an instrument, it was a tool for your social advancement, and people have been talking about that, and it's been like a this this running argument on twitter about like: uh uh you know how much can you test trust people and like i've said on this place i've said that like there's a reason that everybody resorts to bad faith and that there and that twitter is such an undialectical space and one of the big ones is there are these people everywhere there are tons of them not everyone but how the hell are you supposed to tell how can you tell and so that uncertainty drives everyone crazy and they just decide to rely on chiblets, so that's what ends up happening, because everyone is suspicious, the only people you can trust are the people the right words to you, the people who know the passwords, but of course if you know the passwords, you can say anything, if it doesn't matter, you don't have to believe anything if you know the passwords then, and that's what we have with people, all these motherfuckers have learned the passwords, they're not hard, and now they're just using them to walk everywhere they want, and that's why people treat the place with some. the void about it, there's really not going to be any benefit there, because none of the stuff I've explained just now, none of those incentives changed by you owning somebody, it's it's it's b baked in, it's fixed, there's no changing it, but all these people, I will just say this, who find themselves now just in this position of having to defend Joe Biden. as his brain like slowly rolls the clock back and he just thinks that he's in the senate cloke room with strong Thurman and Jesse Helms all the time and they start doing mammy jokes to one another and and he's doing it in public on a fucking microphone and you have to defend it, that's what race first politics will get you, that's what any, that's what any non-class uh political agenda will get you, because you cannot build a coalition that can take over, you can only assert a limited amount of influence uh within the context of a greater coalition, and if capital is leading that coalition, you're never going to get anything other than scraps, and that's where we find ourselves, everybody who has very reasonable, reasonable and and and non bad faith arguments for why republicans are worse for their lives, why republican governance is more painful and exploitative and miserable for people of of certain economic groups. it is, and it's harder, but the thing is, it's so much, it's so bad with democrats that the marginal benefit you're reaping is not anywhere near worth the amount of leverage you're giving up, so what you're keeping at bay is only this much worse than the reality you're going to have, and we know that from Obama, black wealth eventually basically disappeared, all accumulated black wealth of the last four years a huge chunk of... disappeared after 2008 and never came back, that's because of obama's uh wall street bailout and uh his entire approach to the housing crisis which was to have it all fall on the on the shoulders of home owners, that meant hugely disproportionate number of relatively recent home owners uh uh African-American home owners wiped out and never came back that so what are you avoiding by have by by by by by clinging to the democrats? It's only in your head, it's a fantasy of what could have been worse, but what is is so terrible, and it will only get worse because there you have no leverage, watch, watch Biden talk and watch you unable to do anything, watch him pick klobachar for VP, which I think he's going to do, because he's unless this freaks him out, we'll see how long the backlash to this is, but if enough people are going to defend him to defend their own status hierarchy and their own uh credibility, then they might decide it's not a big enough thing to worry about. because what they are really worried about are those numbers in the upper midwest, they're terrified of those numbers in the upper midwest, and if they think klobakar will do better for them there than uh any uh black vp or p vp vp of any other color than white, they're going to pick her and then they're gonna say what are you gonna do about it? so grill, that's uh, that's the gist of what i'm saying here, and you can see it's a bunch of bullshit, we have no control over any of it, no matter what Biden says, no matter what Trump says, it's still basically a coin flip, because the great mass of American voters are not moved by any of this stuff, and we're just we're just the fucking uh, we're the little um little birds cleaning the teeth of the crocodile, that's us and hoping not to get bitten, hoping we can get our fucking bodies out of the way when he's gets hungry, but Guess what eventually you get you're a little slow and then you get eaten too, but if you have a class first politics you can actually build a coalition that can assert real leverage and demands and pry things away from capital and even challenge capital, it cannot be done and because what is what is your intersection of interests cuuse if you have an intersection of a... that's that's explanatory, i think that's a useful useful rubric to explain oppression, but then what do you do about it? what's your intersectional practice? what's your intersectional uh interest point to mobilize around? i mean, for the most part, the one that's most prevalent, the most, the one that reflects most the oppressions we're talking about is class, because racial oppression is felt by degrees and those degrees are pretty much track very very strongly with class. All right, so those are a few things I wanted to get off my chest, wanted to get off, wanted to stop talking about it, got my gears all grinded up, but I had want to get these ideas out just so that I understand them, and I have one other thing that I wanted to say, this is Matt's movie corner, and then maybe we'll take some questions, uh, so I finally after fucking months and months and I said this a couple days ago someone asked if i'd seen drag by dragged uh across concrete, no because i was doing this waiting game to see when it was available on some streaming service to see for free, and i was actually about to give up last night and fucking just click on the thing and watch it, even though and pay for it, it was it would have come to HBO, which i have, so i didn't have to pay extra for it, so i watched dragged across concrete before, last night, and i got to say i think it's his best film, i i've liked all three of the craigsle. or films uh, i really and i really liked uh uh brall and sell cell black 99. i think i might even like this one more uh mikela the critic uh said that ziler is kind of trying to be the modern day don seegal and i think that is precisely correct that is his game like if you ask him who he's trying to be even if he didn't know uh the real answer is he's trying to be Don Seegel just muscular you know uh meat and potatoes american reactionary exploitative exploitation shit. you know like the the white male id you know unleashed in a world it never made or it doesn't get to make anymore uh you know smashing against the confines of society um and doing so in the most violent way possible so I think he really pulls it off in that movie uh and a lot of people got mad at it because it's his most explicitly political yet because he made the first movie and some people muttered a little bit because it has like these beastial uh native american tribes people pannibles as the bad guys, and you know he makes pains to distinguish them from other native American tribes, but people sort of whispered a little bit, I don't know man, that's a little problematic. Then he made Brawl and Selbock 99 which has Vince Von going to war with the cartels and has a lot of racially coded language and it has kind of a you know a mega flare to it, even though it's all very subtle and everyone's like, oh, I think he's really one, and this one he just lets it out, he has seen... where the cops are literally just sitting around going damn cell phone cameras won't allow us to do our jobs thanks to the damn media and they're like yes true uh and he's got these little vignetes that are just like they might as well they could be short films directed by like if tpus had any talent behind it and but it's all shot in like the house style of sort of post millennial uh like prestige programming uh, and it really made me realize that of all the people who have tried to resurrect the exploitation genre in the 21st century and try to do exploitation movies, like post-modern exploitation movies, he is the one who gets them the most, one I think because he is a reactionary, and what he gets the thing that is that most of these people who do neo exploitation don't get, which is that exploitation films are inherently to one degree. another reactionary, specifically vigilantism shit, or I mean cop shit is fucking it's reactionary anything that's about somebody getting fed up and doing an insane amount of violence on people outside the law is reactionary in that it uh it credits like violence as a solution rather than any kind of socially like cooperative endeavor towards a resolution of conflict uh that's not terrible and it doesn't mean it's a it's unwatchable I mean people think that now because we we bound up our politics and our art so much that we can't get them straight and we're all anxiety riddled about it all the time, but it's it's it's a it's a a reactionary genre and therefore the best people to make it are reactionaries, and the way that he like threads in the right-wing stuff in those in the movie, which is also by the way filled with incredibly good, deeply felt uh like social observation and commentary and texture uh because it's not vapid, it's not uh it's not dogmatic, that stuff is in there. because you can't, one of the big problems with trying to make a neo exploitation movie is that you can't shock people the way you could with exploitation films because people have seen everything, we're all desensitized, violence doesn't do anything, violence doesn't move the needle, how do you make violence move the needle anymore? and Zaila realizes, it has to be in contrast to something, the violence has to come as a contrast to the other things in the movies, that didn't used to be the case because the movie was a contrast to everything else, but now everything is movie. so the it had the contrast has to come inside the film itself, and so the contrast of this uh of this state sort of paulhagacy vibe with just explicit reactionary content, it shocks you a little bit, it jars you, just the way that like the the the very um quiet measure tone of all of his movies makes their explosions of extreme violence shocking and jarring, it actually does joltchu the way that these guys, anybody making like ironic exploitation movies doesn't really get around, they don't really grasp the needle of it, uh, and that is why even though I would not actually want her to do this uh, because no one should go, no one with talent should go near Marvel, it's just a giant machine that sucks talent uh and leaves just create uh uncreative dead eyeed husks in its wake because they see God like it's like the fucking lighthouse they go to Disney and they see the frozen head of Walt Disney in a vault and it's throbbing and it has like black eyes and they stare into Disney's black eyes and they come out a husk because they've seen into the heart of the dream machine and they know that it is actually uh the fucking mind of satan, so I would not want him to actually do this because it would destroy him like it's going to destroy everybody, who does who fucks with Marvel uh film-wise, but he is the only person I could think of who could possibly make something good out of the punisher right now, because if anybody saw the Marvel, the the Netflix Marvel show with uh Joe Barrenthall, which is dog shit, one of... the big reasons is CGI blood which is of course out of here and something I know that Zaler would never allow by the way, they didn't just do CGI blood on that show, they did CGI muzzle flashes on the guns, which is just the fucking lowest level of chinsy bullshit. Why am I even watching this? And I know Zeler wouldn't do that, but what, but the other thing that made that thing bad and unwatchable is that it's woke, they tried to make fucking punisher woke because they have this thing that have... a context, the punisher as a context of like coming out of the reactionary ferment of the 70s, the same thing they gave his death wish and dirty harry and all this other stuff, because of the huge r violent crime race and the huge rise of racial anxiety and racial friction uh, he pops out, and and there is no way to make, you can make him the villain, i guess if you wanted to be woke, but you cannot make him the protagonist, the traditional protagonists of something and make him woke, because vigilantism like that is reaction. inherently going outside the bounds of law to use violence against someone individually, not as some sort of some like revolutionary process of of changing the mode of production or the social order, but as an individual, that's i'm sorry, that's reactionary, he is, frank castle is a reactionary, and just because you fucking give him, what, black water and proud boys to kill, that doesn't change that fact, and and but the guys who make these show. those are all good liberals, and so they're very nervous and very anxious about that, so they work backwards, I guarantee you, when they said we're doing punisher, and they're only doing punisher for money, none of them are doing punisher out of inspiration, they wouldn't do punisher, nobody would, it's a fucking comic book, they're adults, they wouldn't do any of the shit if they wanted to, they're doing it because it's where the money is, and the money says, this is the thing people like, so we want you to make more of them, this is the thing that came out of the specific cultural moment, this is the thing that uh, this is the thing that stands in for a... a a mode of male anxiety at a certain hingepoint in American history, an expression of like nialistic uh violence to overcome social conflict, what are you going to do with it? oh well, okay, well that we can't make it that buse that uh that would be bad and people would watch it and then they would want to be like him, it's like they want to be like him anyway idiots, you made him whoa congratulations, did it stop fucking uh fascist nazi cops from putting the fucking uh punisher thing on their on their uh on their v the fact that they've appropriated his symbol shows that you're the one appropriating him, you're appropriating him by making him woke, he can't be, you have to deal with that fact, you want to make him the villain, that's like one choice, or you have to take him as he is, and they're not comfortable with that, and so they have to reverse engineer, zler would take Frank castle as he as he was and that would be that would make for viewing that would make people go oh my god it would be like oh that's a bad idea but unless you're accepting the tip of war world view and you're willing to put that on record that you watch something and then you do it or you believe what it says discretely not socially but discretely as a like obviously we're all we are all nothing but like the accruence of our media consumption but not that's the accruence an individual level you cannot be uh, you cannot be moved into action by any one piece of media, which is a thing that nobody can get their head around, no, all media has to be good all the time because then will all we will all be watching it at the same time, we'll all get the same message and the carebar stare will just burst out of our chests and we will all live in harmony forever, and the thing is that's the only thing they have as a model for social change, because if you deny class politics, like this like and if you say America is indelably racist and therefore we can't change capitalism, uh then all you could do is like hecter people and make art and do posts until they there's so many. art and so many posts that everyone just at one moment, everyone from from the irredemable or enough people, i guess they would say, not everyone, but but like uh to 51% we'll all just snap into into a mutual understanding, that's their only, that's their only hope, so like i so yeah i really like dragged across concrete uh late this post uh Mell is honestly on a role, great performances, I haven't seen all of it, but uh bloodfather was really good uh, and he was really good in this, um, Hacksaw Ridge has some of the best fucking just grody ass violence uh, I've seen in a movie in a long time, and if he does make a he's the one director, if he actually does remake the wild bunch, I'll allow it, because he's the one guy who kind of gets pecking pause, like psycho-religious ecstatic communion with film violence. because I think for most other purveyors of film violence it's either rote or uh sublimated misoggyny or a joke and it is not any of those things for Mel Gibson, it is expiation, it is salvation, which it was for Pecking paw, so thumbs up for dragged across concrete, and yeah, if you're going to make an exploitation movie and you're a left-winger, you can, you just have to leave it at the door, you know. you just have to take it as it comes instead of trying to deform it into something it can never be. i'm trying to, i actually when i was in high school i read a biography of Sam peckenpaw, you can tell this was before the internet, that would i would never imagine now reading a biography of Sam peckenpaw, but i did because there was nothing to distract me, certainly not girls. I was trying, I'm trying to check to see if uh, pec and paw was uh catholic, can't remember, I don't think he was, he's he's like, his family was like western pioneer, so I don't think so, but he certainly had that catholic fixation on uh on a blood, the sanctity of blood. so yeah, if you you can be a left-wing maker of uh of exploitation movies and and somebody says the purge, uh, the purge movies are actually an interesting case because their premise is such that like uh, that they do have a actual left-wing text, which is also possible, like the text. of anything can be any politics you want it to be, it's the subtext i'm talking about, i'm talking about it's it's uh it's um it's heart and that's why the third one that's why uh election day is so weak at the end because they go live they go live at the end because they can't handle the the implications of the genre they're working in and also they use fucking uh cgi. and for me you're not doing you're not making exploitation unless you're using squids. i know that CGI is cheaper now so therefore squibs are actually the luxury catalac alist thing, but i'm sorry you can find somewhere else to cut, you can always find something else to cut. if they could put squibs in surviving edge weapons you can find the budget for squibs in your movie. they did squibs and fucking wild bunch for christ sake. Uh, we are looking to do that script reading. uh, actually, I should bring up Network, I don't, I don't, they might not want to do network, but I would like to do network, uh, maybe they think that, no, I would, I think they would find that, they would think that would be too, uh too self-cententer of me, although you know he's not the main character really, it's William Halden, could definitely see will playing William Holy, but we are probably going to do Miller's crossing, if we can get everybody on board, uh, I think I think we've we were trying to figure out like the terms of service and whether that would be a c copyright infringement, but apparently if you just do it and don't like leave it up, there's not any really way that's going to get brought down, so we're going to try to do that, uh, guess which character I will play, Bernie, yeah, no. I'm not playing uh leo either now, I think we're getting uh Felix, uh, how can the con brothers make incredible insightful films and then be livs? because art and politics aren't the same thing, like there's political truth and there's artistic truth and like artistic truth. is like a prism of all truths and any piece of art is only able to get like one or two reflected rays right of the prison and maybe it might get a little bit of political truth in there, but it's mostly going to be personal, it's mostly going to be experiential and aesthetic and it's and it's going to be abstract, and then you have to build from that, you have to actually build a personality and like a a fucking spiritual sense of yourself that you can then build politics on top of. you can't just have it imported to you directly like fucking uh firmware update from the every movie you watch these things have lives of their own like like uh what we're all trying i mean my god especially when you consider how collaborative film is as as a genre how how many how many minds how many efforts how many decisions are made the idea that any of this stuff has there's any coordinating anything you need to grab you just have to be and the thing is you might not find any and that's fine too, but you have to be open to the the magic basically, the the moments of grace, the sublimity of any piece of art, because it's not necessarily going to be resonating on frequencies of the political, but there are other frequencies of truth and beauty that exist and that can be expressed by almost anyone in any place and time. Rudolph, Rudolph Werliter, yes, I didn't know he was from Cincinnati, uh, yeah, uh, his book quake is really good, what is, all right, this is an interesting question, just because it's so weird, what is the governance ownership of chapo LLC, anything socialist in its structure, I don't know what that means. what i mean we all own it equally so i guess that is so it's like owner operated or like worker operated cuuse we're also the the thing is is that we're not we're not workers but we're also not capitalist we're craftsman we are we are this cottage industry craftsman of of a bygone era like that is that is people want to know like what's the podcaster niche uh at least like the the ones who do self uh like uh distribution like us as opposed to ones that have - an ad network or something, it's it's it's would you like my wayers? i like i'm a cooper basically, we're all like word coopers and you come into our shop and you buy our barrels or not, but we made the barrels and then we get the money for the barrels, that's it, we're not socialist because it's not, it's a pre-modern form of uh, it's it's a it's a it's a remnant. I mean over time it'll go away like all non capitalist social relationships will go away, but it still exists in uh in fragmentary form. I have seen. upstream color, that guy is wild, he just did an interview where he said, I basically can't do movies anymore, I'm sick of fucking trying to make money, get money off of them, to make them, which really should remind you, I mean, how can any of these things that you got that make that spent, when you see filmmakers of genuine talent, just give up because of how hard it is to raise money for things that have like an actual vision behind it, how little does must people care about - and in like a a basic artistic like sense of ownership sense of care, how little must everyone care when they're making fucking you know uh uh avengers, how little must everyone care in order to put up with the demands of that much money, the requirements of that degree of investment, you would have to just turn your actual artistic investment into the thing into a little fucking. kernel so how could the thing coming from that collective shrug be good? Why is Stephen King's twitts tweets so dog shit? I think because he's an old guy trying to tweet more than anything. It's not a form that uh that's that's that he came into, it's a form for people with a completely different social experience, which is why old people in general are terrible out there. I mean and and the thing I don't understand about the people clings. so hard to the idea that politics must be expressed in art and and and has to on a moral level, like if you push them, why does it have to be this way, first it might be something about how well you know it hurts, it hurts people of this groups to see things that aren't sensitive to them, but at the base it's no, people see this bad stuff and then they have the bad thoughts, and if enough of them uh see the good stuff, they'll have the good thoughts, and I don't understand how you can have the 2016 election happen and not really. that that cannot be true, or if it's true, it's true to such a like fractional degree that all the pressure in the world in that direction is not going to move anything, because the entire culture was arraid against Trump, every cultural output was against Trump, and it didn't matter, I might do a spanish civil war episode, we'll see. It's going, like I said, my hope, my my goal would be to get everyone mad at me, uh, hunt for that October is one of those great, man, that was a real stretch in the late 80s, early 90s of just some perfect action movies, really, it it sound, I don't want to, I sound old, but I fuck it, I'll say it, they don't make them like that anymore, just perfect little propulsive thrillers, the same time is like diehard and uh, stuff, predator. good, check it out, hunt for out, crimson tide is also good, i think hunt for at october is better, but they're both good, uh, crimson tide also better than 99% of Ridley Scott's films, so if one again another another, strike one for uh Tony Scott, what chapter I and on moby dick uh, I just finished uh, I just finished the gam. uh, which is a delightful little chapter. I might read one quick chapter to end tonight. I don't know, I got to see if I can find one. Here we go, uh, my next chapter will be the Town Hose story, someone, someone had the Town Hoe, uh, give their tail. That one was very weak, I think it's cuuse it's kind of it's really overcast today and kind of gloomy of. a lot of people are outside, oh wait a minute, never mind, sometimes they'll go and they'll gutter out a little bit, and then I think they get a little embarrassed that they stopped and then they'll all kind of dare each other to go back up. I will read Ulysses, I'm just not, I'm going to reread, I'm getting, I'm trying to go through the 20th, I'm trying to like go through levels of like semantic uh uh facility, I feel I feel very comfortable with Moby Dick, I'm going to go to gravity's rainbow which I've always felt harder a harder time getting my head around. and then I'm going to do uh Ulisses. I went through a major Kurt Vonigat phase when I was in college. I read like not all of them, but a good chunk. Galapagos is really good, uh, breakfast is champions. also very very good, but uh, like most people, the first one of his I've read was Slaughterhouse 5 in high school, and it's one of those books that does a thing to certain people, not everybody, but you if you're in the right frame of mind and if you have the right demographic background probably, it hits you, it hits different and it really does make you start thinking differently about the world. someone wants me to read the lee shore, i get back to that one, might not be there yet, is oh somebody wants me to talk about the demi urge all right, i'll see if i can uh find this thing and then i'll talk a little bit about the demourge. so it's in uh the nasta Christians were an early Christian sect, they believed that the material world was essentially created by an evil spirit that interven between God and eternity to create a false version of the world that we all live in in material bodies created for the purpose of keeping us from each other uh and from God most importantly. and that it was our duty in life to try to transcend that category through concentration of will and and faith and spirit, nosis as it's called uh to understand that higher truth, and I think that that's a useful metaphor for the way that we all live in a reality that is really constructed by uh, an evil demon, that evil dem being demon, that evil demon being the collective. historical weight of all humans to came before us, the history of all dead generations wearing on the minds of the living, we live in structures that we are born into that we did not have any hand in created, and those those structures are deformed, like our our expectations of things our our ideology that we operate under, our expectations of other people our reward systems, are deformed, they are they they are bent away from harmony with nature, harmony with other people, harmony with God, they are bent towards rudeness and and and hatred and uh and uh exploitation, domination, fear, misery, because of the intervening um, because of the failures of of generations of people to see the world as it really is, because of all of the all of the things that they have to deal with that others have placed on them, so that's the... and the thing is is that we can, we can transcend it, we can, we can, we can bring the crooked timber of reality closer to to an even keel, uh, but it just takes a lot of fucking time and a lot of faith, and and a lot of will, and those things are all sapped by the culture we live in, the demairge, basically directing us away from the holy and towards uh, towards selfishness, but all but selfishness is at the end of the day self-defeating, because we can have nothing without each other, we can have nothing without each other. uh, my favorite chapter, i'm not sure yet, which one i really like the most, but let's do the leshore, here it is, oh yes, this is very good, well it's so short, that's so perfect, it's like three, four perfect, five perfect paragraphs. some chapters back one bulkington was spoken of, a tall new newlanded mariner encountered a new bedford at the end. when on that shivering winter's night the pekwad thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should i see standing at her helm, but bulkington. i looked with sympathetic on and fearfulness upon the man who in midwinter just landed from a four years dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous turn. the land seems scorching to his feet. wonderfulest things are ever they unmentionable. deep memories yield no epithaths. this six inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington. let me only say that it fared with him as with the stormtos ship that miserably drives along the leaward land. the port would fain give sucker. the port is pitiful, in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortalities. but in that gale, the port, the land. is that ship's direst jepardy? she must fly all hospitality, one touch of land, though it but grays the keel would make her shutter through and through. with all her might she crowds all sail offshore, and once in so doing fights against the very winds that fain would blow her homeward. seeks all the lash sees landlessness again, for refuges sake forlorly rushing into peril, her only friend, her bitterest foe. ye know ye now Belkington, glimpses do ye? seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth, that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepit effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea, while the wildest wins of heaven and earth canspire to cast her on the treasurous slavish shores. but as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, surelessness and definite is god, so better is it to perish in that howling infinite than being gloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety. for worm like then, oh who would? crave and crawl to land, terror of the terrible is all this agony so vein, take heart, take heart, oh bulkington, bear the grimly demigod, up from the spray of the ocean perishing, straight up leaps the apotheosis, that's actually a good chapter to read right after talking about nasticism because i feel like that if you want to understand like what i mean by like the demourgical nature of reality, this thing the glimp um all deep earnest thinking prayer, meditation. communion with our understanding of the infinite, which that's God in any language, is but the intrepit effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea, while the wildest winds of slave of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treasurous, slavish shore, because we have to live in this world, and living in this world distracts us and pulls us away from our understanding of our mutual interdependence, and in fact our mutual... identicalness and it pulls us off of that being and that that is, then we make a world that is demonic, and we make that world and all collectively we are the demourge, so you are the demourge, I am the demourge, this later, greater and smaller extents, we're all building a world that makes it hard for people who are living in it to to find God, whatever that means, to find a transcendence from this seeming prison of of of isolation and and confusion and loneliness and fear, this doom doom to die, doom to eternal night without ever understanding any of it, all right guys, Uh, talk to you soon, this is a good one. Bye-bye.
