 Yeah, hey guys, does this work? It's a flip? I guess not, I got some stuck with this, so I'm uh, I'm out here doing. Instagram live one more time uh because it's the one day strike uh at Amazon and other places and I know that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism which is a a a banal and true fact I don't hilana hi John I do not uh let anybody by the way if you know me and you want to come on just pop on give me a request and I'll say hi um if you don't though. I mean I I need a little bit more uh, I think I need a little bit more degree of uh comfort with you before I make that move, at least while I'm trying to formalize this stuff, um, anyway, so there is no ethical consumption under capitalism, it's fine to do whatever you think you need to do, uh, but for me, given my degree of, I do not have any need to be on to be streaming on uh, twit on Anthony basson right now so I'm not going to and I feel like if uh that's the attitude you should take like every time there's a strike especially for companies like this that are about convenience there's someone gets really mad and says well what if you need what and they create these these imaginary situations where someone would need to use the service and it's like well then they should use it but you're not in that situation you're you need to know what your own situation is how much do you depend on this thing, how much would it cost you not to utilize it when other people who are of good faith are doing something that you agree with, and so if they tell me that, I'm going to just do it, you don't have to, no one else has to, but to me that is how i align my greater belief in the rightness of the striker's cause with my life, I would feel if I was on, I could be doing this on Instagram, I could be doing this on Twitch right now, and I would feel nothing but a very little bit of of... of guilt, but it would still be a little bit of guilt that I would have to deal with, instead of trying to figure out the world, like instead of applying my mind to what's in front of me, the way I've been doing now for the last almost week, part of my mind would be distracted by the nagging guilt that I was on Twitch, now I can stream to you guys directly, don't feel guilty, and also by thinking about that and thinking about my relationship to twitch and my relationship to boycots in general, I understand my own motivations even. better than I did, so the whole thing, for me, good, and hopefully it'll have an impact, I that I am less certain of, uh, but I certainly fucking hope that we can get together some degree of social coordination to counteract the terrifying uh uh or um accumulating capital of guys like Bizos, it's like yikes, very scary stuff, and anyone wants to fight them, and I know we're on Twitch and that is the that's an smaller uh hypocrisy that I deal with, that one I think I can justify just out of it's it's a good way to get out to people, an idea that they might find useful, and then I can justify, but considering that there other options available and people have specifically said, don't access this site on this day, I'm just going to do it, like I said, if you make a different conclusion, it's because you have different material circumstances to deal with, and so I'm not going to claim to know you. That is why you can be totally judgemental of other people's actions, but not judge them for them if you're aware that they were all brought about by conditions outside of every individual's control, but that when you're in that superposition of being aware of that, then you have to choose. So how are you guys doing? uh, unless I got a really tasty question, I'll be back on Twitch tomorrow, uh, well see, how do we counteract businesses like Walmart shutting down stores to avoid unionizing draft? see that is where that's what suggests that in a retail uh service economy like the one we have we actually have to bring together the boycot and the strike to bring together the power of the consumer and the worker because in a way that wasn't the case under large scale and isn't the case under large-scale manufacturing, the customer truly is the consumer, i mean the uh the the worker truly is the consumer in the retail in the retail context, so like... consumer, you have a relationship to Walmart that is more in to a worker than uh than manager, and so the key to effective action against mega corporations like Amazon and Walmart is not consumer boycott and it's not individual uh, I mean it could start with, but it can't be sufficient to do individual strikes within individual areas, because as you see they can just shut them down. you need a coordination inside and outside between customers and employees, a a revoking labor in the form of a strike and then revoking patronage in the form of a boycot, then they go together, that's the only way to actually uh punish them, that's the only way to stop them from closing a walmart is if it will have repercussions outside of that walmart, that's only if people respond with with their role as in their role as a consumer, they have they have a role as a consumer, if the degree to which it's coordinated with the work of the of the labor of the workers, like boycots get rightfully pooed by a lot of people because they are imagine to happen uh in isolation and in isolation boycots don't work, i just said that as you typed it, boycots don't work in isolation, but as we are seeing. in a post-industrial uh landscape uh strikes, they work better than boycots, but they aren't 100% effective, and that a strike would be made, could be made more effective if it was in conjunction with a boycott in the context of retail, like big box stores and stuff like that, but once again it's not an on off switch, it's not a works good enough to fix it or it doesn't work at all and is a failure. "it will work to a degree, and then other things happen, and then you gather up the reactions to those new material conditions, and you move from there, and it's maybe it's no longer a boycot and and strike, maybe it's something else, but you move on depending on your recognition of the changed material circumstances. happy Mayday, by the way, I'm sure most of you know the story of the uh, of the of the hey." market bombing, the hey market marters, albert parsons, august spees uh, those brave marters, the bomb thrown at the haymarket rally, the dead cops, cops shooting in the crowd, the uh frenzied red scare, the crack down on the city of chicago ever since, the uh gind up trial, which led to the unjust executions of uh of what i believe it's seven, market marters uh, one of them though, the bomb maker, uh, yeah, I'm already off, um, the uh, one of them, uh, Lewis Ling, the German bombmaker, he was scheduled to be executed, but he had uh, I want to, I want to, I want to look this up so I have the correct quote, it's an amazing quote, he had, he was able, he had smuggled into his uh, sell by one of his visitors uh a blasting cap in his mouth and he bit down on it and essentially blew his face off uh pretty gruesome botched execution uh similar to wolf tone the famous uh irish republican revolutionary who similarly botched cutting his own neck uh also robspeare botched shooting himself blasted his jaw off anyway as he lay dying on the floor of his cell, wrote in his own blood, while his face was blown up, he wrote her for anarchy in his own blood on the floor of a cell after blowing his face off, that's pretty huray for anarchy, hawk the anarchy in german. uh, don't get used to the ig, if the strike is, if the if the strike is off tomorrow, I'll be back on uh Twitch, but as long as they're the the the employees are calling a strike i'll be not on twitch. So yeah, uh, so the hegh market marters who led to the creation of Mayday uh, they were all anarchists uh uh, and they were all part, they were all believers in one degree or another to the uh to the notion of the propaganda of the deed uh and to uh industrial syndicalism which were the chief practices of of anarchism, basically assassinating people and trying to organize workers into revolutionary uh unions, not ones interested in things like uh floor conditions and and shit, but that was the incident that led to Mayday becoming the international labor day, it was not the it was, it was it was the inciting incident for making it into a international day to honor labor uh and it was used as a way to agitate towards uh uh socialist ends of course that's why we created um labor day as a depoliticized americanized day where we can study labor not as a process of exploitation or we can celebrate labor not in the context of it being you know an unjust exploitation of of of someone's species being which is what it was under Mayday now hey you got to job, it's a way to celebrate, uh, and they changed Mayday to law day uh during the red scare, but guess what, it's still there, you could still call it Mayday, you can still, I'm sure the anarchists in Seattle who like to r uh go crazy around this time are not happy with their inability to do it, maybe they're going to like kick out their own front windows, I don't know while they're under quarantine, but this is actually a good segway to something I wanted to talk about, referring - something i had said later um or earlier and that is that we're talking about chamsky and we're talking about anarchism, libertarian socialism and i said that Chamsky is a liberal and people got justifiably defensive about that, people respect chcey's viewes, people find liberal to be an epithet and not a descriptor, people who you feel a lot of value in the anarchist tradition, which is understandable, and now I thought about it a little more and I realized that I misspoke that uh, I think the basic principle i was arguing is correct, but I did not elaborate clearly enough on why, so uh, my basic argument there was, so some leftists like Mediasan, and are dragging out democrats do every four years, the increasingly aged Noom Chamsky, they wind him up like a fucking uh. been uh and they ask him should you vote for the democrat and he says yes and then people like mediasan say see Chamsky says vote for Biden, you're not to the left of Chamsky, so that means the left position is to vote for Biden. And now Mediasan I think probably has bad faith in that, but I don't think that uh Chamskiy has bad faith. I think a lot of like you see people talk about how when this comes up they'll say, oh you know... my tea all those years and defense contracts, and i mean the bulk of his work and the bulk of his work on life belies that being real. i mean, he clearly says what he believes, he has paid the price for saying what he believes his whole life uh, and and the way i know that he bears a price is because he answers every email he receives, which means he is clearly at some level seeking truth, no one would do that if they worked, so i believe chomsky when he when he says that his reason gets him to voting for Biden, this is where liberalism comes in, because I think, and you can listen to me and tell me if I'm wrong or not, I think that um, that Chamsky's liberalism, is why he, I think he's wrong, first of all about voting for Biden, and I think his liberalism, so just not just to say he's wrong in isolation, but you you've only ever explained something if you've explained why, a lot of shit that have... on the internet is people describing a condition and then calling that an argument, you haven't made an argument until you've added a why, so I will make the proposition, uh, first of all we'll take the as as assumed proposition among us, that yeah, you don't have to vote for Biden, that's silly, you don't agree with him, now let's figure out why we disagree with him on this, and this is once again how I have reasoned it out, you can tell me how you think I'm wrong if you do, and I and the reason I made that people said, nom shamsky is a liberal and that came up. is because they had in intuitive understanding that that was tied to his wrongness in this case, and a lot of people took that the wrong way, and they're like, oh, do you mean it, like he's too stupid or he doesn't get it, or he's too, cuz when you say someone's a liberal, you mean there's some combination of stupid and uh greedy, there's some combination of too dumb to get the point or materially positioned where they don't want socialism, so they're either grum dumb or greedy if they're liberal, like that's what liberal is, it's it's some combination of those two things and the thing is we all are to some extent, and how much we are depends on our fixed position and space time and the life we've lived, so when I say that Chapsky is a liberal, guess what, Carl Marks. is also a liberal, two different extents. now to the extent that Chamsky is a liberal is the extent that he has explicitly said that his vision of the world, his vision of politics, his vision of practice, all comes from enlightenment thinking. he has said that a million times, he even points to a specific, relatively obscure german humanist as like his uh, his foundational um uh influence, i'm going to find the guy's name, i keep forgetting it. uh, champsky enlightenment, some crowd influence, one of my people, one square headed motherfucker, uh, god damn it, now I feel like I'm losing you guys, buse I can't find the name of this dude, it's some dumb name, Anyway, I will find it at some point in the meantime, what matters is is that he fixes himself in the liberal tradition of personhood, so when he says uh, I want to do x, y and z because of the liberal tradition, what he means is he, he believes in socialism as a moral proposition flowing from the invalibility of the individual, that's where the liberalism comes in, he believes that the individual is an unmoved uh place of... Western Europe became more complicated, became more abstracted and required a greater degree of abstracted thinking in order to process it, and that created a more abstract notion of the... self than the more immediate motion notion of the renaissance uh era uh or certainly the medieval era where everyone believes in god. so this that version of theself that emerges to compensate for this new more complicated, this this new more complex economic arrangement and social system that you're in, makes you into that liberal subject, so he carries that with him and he said that, and so that means that he's approaching uh, I'm sorry, so that's why he is a liberal when he approaches the question of should you go for Biden. Now, Marks start also as a liberal subject, because he was born in the early 1800s in uh, in southwestern Germany, a region that was one of the on one of the areas near the ruor valley that was one of the original hotbeds of of of industrial capitalism. now industrial capitalism was still in its infancy, but he saw it and his life took place in tandem. with the arriving of industrial uh capitalism, witnessing that in his life and and and witnessing its impression on the world around him made him think differently and it made him take the dialectical processes that lead that he noticed lead through uh economic development, like what powered us from slave states to feudalism to capitalism, it was a dialectical uh conflict of forces within the society, slave, freeman, surf, uh, uh, master, surf uh, lord, uh, worker, uh, uh, owner, that's a that is how society comes into recognition of itself as a society, is through conflict within it, he applied that as Hagel did, Hagel did to the south, now. They say that they do it on different sides, but that comes back to the same thing. The soulf is a series of resolved contradictions. It is not an individual monab that moves up its own volition, it is, always being made by what's around it, and that means that when we examine a political question, we have to examine it in time and space, so that is why Chamsky looks at the question of vote for Biden two-dimensionally, here's. the democratic party, here's the republican party, the democratic party is less evil, it's less bad, it's platform is not as bad, the people who make it up are better people in the sense that they have more agreed upon uh stated values that accord with what we think is the good, so uh, shit, what was that? so anyway so that's the democrats are on that axis better than republicans and so chsky says i want what's best for everybody, the democrats want more of what's best for people than the republicans do the I have to go for democrats and the thing is that's correct, he reason that out right, he's right, but only on that mirror level, he has not interposed the context on top of it, and the context that chopsky misses, because he's not applying dialectical reasoning to the question, is the role that the democratic party plays in making the republican party worse over time, they drive each other, the degree to which the presently construed democratic party is allowed. to maintain its structure, the people in charge of it and its material base as in who contributes money to maintaining it, that will continue to as it has, drive the republicans bad to the right, even more reactionary, so the rule is even worse, and that means that when they take power, they only intensify a process that's uh that's going to happen either way, like take for example, if biden is president during a world def. economic collapse following buse like okay, say we get the virus under control, when we let back up, there is no return to normal, there is a huge demand gap that will have to be filled, and filling it is will be a bigger challenge than the great depression, if the democrats are in charge of that process the way the republicans were during the early days of the depression, they will be the party associated with austerity, because they will be doing the bidding of actual capital, and in a situation like... that austerity is demanded, so they will be the cap that reactionary party, which means that the republicans, they're not going to get less racist, they're going to get maybe a little less racist, they're going to get more redistributive, and maybe it'll be enough to get them into power, at which point you have a you have like a mild social, a few mild social democratic trappings to a system that is mostly dedicated to like an ethno state, you flipped it over, you could have had the other thing. so whatever that is, that dimension is absent from Chamsky's analysis of the situation, and so it's wrong, and the reason he gets it wrong is because he comes from a liberal conception of the self, he thinks that the democratic party and the republican party are distinct things that move of their own volition based on what the people within them want, that's not the case, they are brought into being in conflict one another with one another always. at the personal and system and intellectual level, so that is why Chomsky is wrong, and it comes from him being a liberal, like I said, Marx was also, oh, here's here's the here's the kicker, Marx also, growing up in the early 1800s, had a liberal conception of theself, that he interposed on top of dialectical materialism, so he accepts personhood to the level that Chamskiy does of all humans are worthy of respect, that that the golden. rule applies to all recognizable humans, depending on how we define that, but then he puts dialectrical materialism on top of it. Chomsky doesn't, and so that can run off in all kinds of wrong directions when it comes in contact with a place that has evolved beyond the conditions that produce to the original insight. All right, that made sense. I felt better about that one. I got to say, like this is why... the key to all of like a thought and right action and all those notions that I never really understood for Buddhism and and Christianity and Islam and and from socialism is uh practice the need to do them every moment and so like I felt kind of crippled by how people were going to think I was crazy when I started explaining things a few of the episodes ago. Now by rebepetition and keep doing it and from hearing back from people who heard me I have more. that fear is gone, so I'm able more to concentrate on getting across the ideas and I'm better able to to uh get the ideas across, I am able to concentrate more perfectly because I'm less worried about appearing crazy, because I got feedback in the form of you guys talking to me saying I wasn't, that's it, that is encapsule how you learn and think and become a human being, it is a process and that is what the liberal conception of theself. cannot absorb and that is why anarchism even if it has the right goals will go about go about achieving them less efficiently like it could still get there over enough space and time but compared to other approaches given the limits of our lives and the limits of matter in the universe uh there are more effective ways to go about it. so once again i am asking for all um all feedback and base basically the way i approach all this stuff is if you say something what i realized is is that when i was a takesmith when my job was just piping off takes um the way that i would uh if i got to a level of understanding of an issue that i did not fully grasp, i would have an emotional response, usually it would be some sort of panic and shame that i didn't know, that panic and shame would have to be transformed into over um over compensation elsewhere in the form of dropping a big name of somebody whose book i probably hadn't read uh you know saying something loud and obnoxious or perf. my anger because that distracted from the fact that i had hit bottom on a point and that that left me rootless i don't know where to go if i don't know why i think what i think and dialectical reasoning which is something i had seen written about and talked about never understood now thanks to absolute luck i'm in a position where i can explain it to myself enough to convince myself to do it. and that makes me better at it, it's literally growth, and it comes, but it only, and the thing is it happens no matter what, but if we recognize the process, if we recognize that it is through uh resolution of conflicts, then we recognize the need for action at all times, the need for acting on our through our, and then people say, yes, but what about the crippling postmodern condition, the crippling uh quotation marks on everything that recursion to self-consciousness, well once again, if you add another dimension, if you add time to the dimension, that problem goes away, so I believe simultaneously, this is a little up there, and I won't go too far to drive people out, but I simultaneously, in equal measure, believe that um, all actions, up to including my decision to lift up this spindrift. uh grape fruits spraking water and taking a sip from it are fully and completely physically determined. i had no say in the matter if viewed from outside the process, if viewed from god's eye, if viewed outside of spacetime, it is, it's billiards, it's direct causality. there's nowhere you can get down to a level and find something that wasn't caused directly by something else, but the... comes an inflection point, if you are aware enough of time, and time is it occupies the space that you occupy, you can recognize your position, you can recognize the determined position of everyone else, you can understand why everything is the way it is, why you are where you are, why the person you're talking to is in their position to you, why they're mad at you, why they're happy to see you, why anything. why that garbage truck is bareling towards you? why anything? why there's a recession? why the TV show isn't good anymore? why? uh, you have a fucking answer, and if you have an answer, you can act from full confidence, and that means it doesn't matter that technically your actions were determined. in the moment you see every option and you have the confidence to do the leap of faith the keykard speaks of. the leap of faith comes from having confidence in your decision, the decision gets confidence from your degree of perception, that when you are making a decision to do something, you are confident that you are perceiving correctly, and if you're only perceiving space or only in a little bit of time, you will be racked with doubt and it will paralyze you, but if you have enough consciousness of time, as a dimension on top of space, then you can act with full free will, and the thing is is that you always are acting on free will, it's just at a different level, like when you jack off instead of cleaning your room, you're acting of free will, what it boils down to is you want to jack off to distract yourself from the fact that you are not doing a thing that is in accord with what will get you to a consciousness and and a sensation of time. and you don't want to clean your room because it's boring and it's boring to the because all physical activity involves you know some degree of mental mental uh output, the more mental output it takes up, the less space is left for the questions, that's where on we comes from, that's where like existential anx comes from, it's from that the degree to which you're not directly engaged, which is why people seek things like drugs, sex. jacking off uh war, they're seeking the heightning to non, they're seeking the heightning of symbolic reality beyond words, that's what they're looking for. and so if you're going to clean your room, the only way that's going to get you to not feel that way is to literally keep thinking while you're picking things up, keep thinking about picking things up, thinking about what's going on around you, how long is that going to take? it's going to suck, you have to the amount of like present potential pleasure that you have to give up to keep doing that, eventually if you don't believe in it, if you don't believe in doing it to get there. you're going to try something else like jacking off, so there is no such thing as a contradiction, and no such thing as a hypocrisy everything you do or don't do, it's because of what you truly believe, and becoming conscious of time, aka mindful aka in the moment, aka dialectical, uh, is the degree to which you can actually put faith behind action. All right, that's what I got. I don't know if it made sense, I don't know if I'm uh, there's problems with me, uh, as I'm talking though, like like now, a little bit of the the worries going back, but it's now it's after, not during, which makes me feel better about it. Uh, you guys uh, want to hear me talk a little bit about fascism because I realized I've talked a lot onto shows and I've thought a lot. over the years about fascism and i realized i was missing some significant parts about it. significantly the question that is really powerful and really on people's minds now because we see how insufficient our institutions are to dealing with the current crisis. what if fascism comes back? what's going to bring fascism back? and that has led to further splits down at different levels of meaning, different levels of semantic translation that have resulted in now there's a big fight on the left about. fascism a real threat uh the fash is there a cheppo to fash pipeline, do we have to worry about fash in the streets? uh, should we be doxing pepes, because if we don't they're going to march like uh, like the essay uh through Nurremberg uh, and I think that there's been a lot of heat expended on this topic, uh, I know that I've generally been skeptical of the looming threat of fascism, but I haven't been able to express it. and I feel like now I'm a little closer to understanding it and so I want to just get it out there and see if you guys make sense of it so my main objection to people wanting to label things in the current moment is fascism is my knowledge of how historically fixed fascism was in terms of it's hard it's impossible to imagine fascism outside of uh the post world war one context in Europe like the cultural ingredients were very specific uh but also you want to have a word for you nationalist authoritarianism when it shows up, but once again that was because I wasn't thinking dialectically, I was thinking only along the planes of uh binaries and not the binary, the nesting binaries, so now I real, now what I realized, and you guys can tell me if I'm wrong, is that the the root of my objection there, that fascism uh, has like a fixed inner war context really does. lead you to a further insight that tells you really what the threat is in the moment in my opinion. so first of all we have to understand what fascism is. now it's one thing to say fascism is capitalism in crisis. that's true. the thing is, it's capitalism in a specific type of crisis. it is in a crisis of uh, it is in a material crisis. it is in a crisis where you have the the built-up industrial capacity, but you don't have. have the inputs, there is a demand shortfall uh, otherwise known as a depression. now capitalism was relatively new in the 20s, uh uh, modern democracy was even newer, so in the coldran of these things came this thing that solved a lot of questions about mass politics and about uh crisis of capitalism, but in the wrong. way, they solved a lot of the problems of maintaining a system, but at the expense of you, the soul of the people living under it. um, so if we think of uh, there being two types of inputs to cap into into capitalism or any economic system, if we think of them as uh, human labor, obnoxiously put by uh, and more generally biopower, the term that that invented. just human inputs into uh into human systems, like like intellectual and literal like sinuos, so biopower and technology, that is: balance in all economic orders that have risen to this complexity of having uh tools, so it was it's so this was a biocrisis, this is not a crisis of technology, it was a crisis of inputs, and fascism's solutions, fascism's specific colution solution to a crisis of inputs and capitalism is to solve that by grabbing inputs from outside, first by building up military. forces that had to be used because military resources are the kind of things that if they're not used they literally take up space uh and and undermine your ability uh to maintain uh economic regularity but take then use that military to literally take from outside it was it's it's like capitalism is dying it's a fish on the beach flopping and its last attempts to get some uh oxygen came in the form of bursting outward. to grab and hold, and of course, because that is going to bring counterresponses in the form of everyone else banding together against you, you're probably going to die, but you wouldn't necessarily, um, I think that Philip K dick made a very good point, uh, uh, in his observation of the plot of the man in the high castle, so even if the Nazis and the Japanese had one world war to, and become the new cold war, their fascist regimes were structured for that environment. They were structured for the the frantic grab for resources in the scarcity moment of a uh of a significant capitalist crisis in capitalism uh they're not built for scar plenty they're not built for growth and so for no reason at all they're going to end up nuking each other because fascism is not built for those conditions uh but the impulse the impulse to solve like all right so now we're going to have another crisis like the great depression. the impulse within capitalism to solve that problem through hyper exploitation of biopower basically like that's what that's what i meant by expanding outward using your the hyperexploiting biopower to build up the capacity to literally enslave the forces of others in the form of the slaves who were to be literally turned into a slave race um so that's that problem in capitalism still exists of how to how to solve the biopower technology issue now there's technology, there is a potential technology solution to that, which is you know, oh we get - free energy or you know 3d printing or whatever people were talking about in wired magazine five years ago, but if that doesn't happen and it doesn't look like it is, because honestly a lot of these uh, a lot of these currents end up looking like scams to get vc money retroactively, so um, so the problem is still there, there's still a technological pro like uh barrier so if if we're going to keep capitalism basically and we can't solve it the problem technologically, which was true under in german in Europe after world war world war one they had a economic problem that an economic crisis that could not be solved technologically, they had to uh enslave and exploit biopower uh like the the other solution to that would have been to communalize to share uh the like uh to share more evenly the surplus. and reduce the pain and the accompaning social crisis caused by the pain uh from hyper exploitation. now some countries did that to some different degrees, like dumb ass Jonah goldberg says that the new deal is uh naziism because it had public works. no, the new deal had the same features, some of the same features as nazism, to do to socialize surplus productively. naziism did socialize surplus productively, but that's not all it didn't do that. not all it did, it also built up this military state that had to be used, uh, if you if if you the degree to which you draw surplus down and use that to alleviate disruption and pain caused by crisis, is the degree to which capitalism has been tamed, basically the way FDR tamed it uh in the United States, that's one way to go, and you could go farther, like if things have gone differently, if if if the tiching uh sticks and fallen differently, we would have built socialism in America or something much closer to it out of the new deal. things intervened later to stop that from happening, but we were on a trajectory thanks to a general tendency in America because of a specific outlay to move things in that direction. Germany because of its specific outlay of material conditions went towards solving it uh with hyper exploitation and destruction of biopower. We are in the same boat now, we're going to be anyway, I mean we're already. a lot of us already there, more of us are going to be in the boat as things continue to get bad, and we're going to have the same crisis of capitalism, there's going to be the same technological limit on on increasing surplus. that way that means there's going to have to be a hyper exploitation of biopower, which of course is why one of the things I had pointed out earlier about fascism in a different episode uh in the unibrated past was that one feature of fascism is that it brings colonial practices into the metropole. now if we see colonialism as capitalism reaching out in its like in the death throws of its productive state within a country to gain more resources and markets to to sustain itself. and then you have a crisis of capitalism in which you know because first that there's a weird there's a weird dynamic with uh with empires where at first they're enriched and then over time as like uh the networks solidify uh the extent of empire actually becomes a burden on the middle state but it's okay because it's it's it can be afforded eventually there's a crisis those things start those beam start cracking and all of a sudden the biopower you need to hyper exploit isn't on the periphery anymore. It's in your home country and you have to and you have these tools you've used on those natives to use on your people, so but you what you're seeing is the response to a input crisis by hyper exploitation and uh and destruction of biopower, and that is a possibility now, but here is the thing, and here is why I hesitate to use the word fascism to describe what I think is the danger, we they're still going to hit a a a technological limit on how... much they can increase surplus or whatever, absent exploitation and hyper exploitation and destruction of biopower, but that level is way higher than it was in the 20s, way higher, so we have much more technological, so so there's much more technological undergurting of society and our political order, now what that means is there's much less, there's much less of a biopow aspect of political power, back in the 20s, political powerment bodies in the streets over... as capitalism got more complicated and as the middle class grew and his symbol symbolic language got more complicated, language fled to the actual uh, like board rooms of i mean the executive suites of power only, and then it was just a symbol for people to respond to, because they no longer had their hands on the real wheels of power anymore, now we have such a technologically advanced society and the bio mechanism of politics is so... impoverished that if they decided that they needed to execute like the fascist playbook in terms of hyper exploitation to recescitate uh surplusses, they don't need the mass movement that naziism represented, they don't need people in the streets, they don't need uh brown shirts or proud boys, they have invested enough power in a alienated machine, machine uh tools surveillance. uh uh cctv, computers, gps, drones, whatever, the degree to which that has accumulated to to capital and to the capitalist state since the 20s, the degree to which that has accumulated is the degree to which the need to have a mass right-wing movement of any kind falls away, because you don't need them, you don't need the bodies, you don't need the beef boys in the streets with guns, you don't need gavin mcginness, you have the state array with a technological advantage over regular people that is undefeitable, you don't need to further uh bolster authority with with popular legitimacy, because that's what fascism was, it was an attempt to give give capitalism, the the uh the popular legitimacy necessary for it to continue. now in order for those people to believe in capitalism, they needed to give them skapegoats for why things weren't getting better enough, and that's what that's the engine. that leads to the holocaust, they didn't need to do it, but they felt they did, because they convinced themselves it was necessary, because it was an underlying fundamental lie that they told to keep capitalism going, because there was such a mass, there was such a huge role of people in in creating state power, state power, i mean my god the the brit, the German state almost got overthrown like three times in the 20s by sparticists or whatever, botched general strikes, um, uh, that was a environment in which popular legitimacy needed to adhere to any regime that was going to continue to exist, it would be ripped up otherwise, and fascism was a way to do that. I don't think that need in the system exists anymore. I think it is a byproduct of the system, and you see deformed smaller versions of it, but because we have such an impoverished political uh, bioterrain, they're not. relevant to the struggle because they're not at the point of force, the point of force is in a fucking uh in a trailer, an air conditioned trailer in Nevada with a joystick. he's in a gamer's chair, uh, he's got like fucking candy necklace around himself, he's twitch streaming, and he's an annihilating a fucking wedding in Yemen, he could just as easily be annihilating a militia gathering in Montana, and if things go in one way, he will be, but it will not require a mass political movement to do it, it will require new ideologies, but they will have to apply to fewer and fewer people because they'll need fewer and fewer people to push the buttons. and the people who aren't pushing the buttons can literally at that point of crisis be exterminated. he's dabbing on us folks, booya, booya, and what we call right-wing populism is a vestige and an echo of that, but in a new context in which the political realm is deeply technological, technologized. and dehumanized, it all takes place on screens, politics takes place on screens and then what rallies which are literally like going to a concert, you know, it's like watching tv and then going to the movies that constitutes like the act of watching tv and going to the movies, the actual act of it, sitting in a chair, looking at a screen in your house, going outside, sitting in a chair and looking at something else, or going to the theater or whatever, those two acts uh constitute the sum total of most people. and they did die in large numbers a horse westle light which was the song uh which was like the the theme song of the the stumar the brownshares was about a murder young ssa officer who was killed by a communist even though in reality it was like some sort of fight over a sex worker and he was a uh pimp but like that was part of it was like living or dying were part of it now it is it's a cathartic theater all those jacket like everyone's shitting their pants about those absolute lumps hanging around the Michigan uh courthouse, they're allowed to do that because they're not a threat to any power structure, and see that's different in other countries, like I would be much more comfortable saying that whatever is going on in India shares those... features because uh the technological balance is so much different because there's so many people for one thing. i've read er fascism i like paxton's book on fascism a lot because it contextualized it in in like actions as opposed to ideology. because honestly i feel like anybody who wants to talk about fascism and their sources are like thinkers, even if it's guys like evola or miniscuus moldbug or any of these guys, you're missing the point, because fascism was a praxis, it was a it was a attempt to channel popular support uh and popular mobilization away from socialism down the easier road of a co-opted populism because the nazis had a much easier road to take power than the soviet than the communist did, even though they had similarly huge followings, similarly mobilized street bands, uh, it was because the state wasn't stepping on the necks of the nazis, so it's a cynical recognition that you can skip the steps, like Mussolini looks and sees, hey, I can use this rhetoric and these ideas to get people in the streets to give me power, and I don't have to worry about the landlord hiring some mob dude to blow my brains out with a shotgun sometime when I take a shit, i don't have to worry about uh the fucking uh getting arrested because the people in power need me to to uh to channel some of that away and to redirect it in a fight to suppress it. it's a purely cynical move. the person who mais that move in that decision has no values. so anybody who made the pivot to to to because you can talk all you want about socialists inspired. and the moment they chose to say, you know what, this whole working class thing is too tough, there's too many obstacles, i could use some of these other elements and some of these other critiques without getting the state down my back, now that should tell me something, the fact that the state doesn't want me, doesn't want to stop me, should tell me that they're not interested in ending the exploitation that is the cause of all of this, if they were they wouldn't let me take power, so i should think about that. and if you don't if you ignore that because you're too greedy or you're too dumb, then you're not a socialist anymore, you're you've you've gone off on another tangent, you're in another uh, you you've stepped off into another uh parallel dimension, bye-bye, because that's a moral choice, it's a moral choice and an intellectual choice, it's a test, and you failed it both ways, because look at the fascists, that was not a stable basis for a society, you fucked up, like sorry, the the German state. the German people could not do what you thought they could do, Adolph, objectively, you were wrong, like Adolph is one of the few gods who can know definitively that he like lost, like he basically Hitler basically knows more than any other one of the few human beings on earth who knows what uh Satan felt like in uh in Paradise lost, because he was god, he was remaking the world with his voice, basically on a principle that he believed as deeply as I believe in mine. uh, but the thing is that outcome would have been was determined in the real, he was he cuuse he couldn't wait, he needed to have it now, which means he needed to see it happen in front of him, which means that he took a bunch of shortcuts that got him fucked over, and so even by his own rule, even by his own law, he was found wanting, like in the bumpker when when the soviets were invading, he famously was like, fuck the Germans, they failed me, but then of course he also failed them. and he knew that as he blew his brains out, he knew that, so no one went to hell harder than uh, no one was casted into hell with greater fucking uh alacrity than Adolf Hitler. Yes, of course. Yes, become a communist and start organizing essential workers. I agree with that. The problem is, I don't have sufficient confidence in a specific set of actions that will get me there yet, and that's the thing, uh, one of the things that defeats growth is that you label yourself as having certain capacities, and then you just never try again. If you don't judge yourself and say, "I have insufficience to this task." now, I might not later, you'll find that you can do things a lot easier. I love, oh, someone asked about Wilhelm Wright, I only know about the oregone box, and I love the concept of oregone, I think it's a very good uh, metaphysical like uh, visualization of a real phenomenon, excuse me. Well all right, somebody says uh are office workers management or uh labor, they are, like most things a degree, they are to a degree worgers and they're to a degree management and their relationship to management and labor is contingent on the specific moment you're talking about, so that's as much details I can get into, and that's one of the reasons it's hard to talk anywhere, let alone online is because you end up making shortcuts. linguistically and symbolically that uh reduce the actual content of what you're trying to get across, and then people don't fully get what you're trying to say, so like if I tried to get more specific there, uh, I would start using words wrong, because because I don't have the grannular knowledge of the situation down to the level of like almost pure uh visuals uh symbol, so no, dual, see that's the thing, dualism is a... trap if you think that there is only dualism, the binaries are a trap if you think there are only binaries uh, but there are the universe is made up of binaries, binary opposites trying to occupy the same space at the same time and being cast out by that action, but there are so many of them happening at so many different levels that also everything is purely relative to east. to uh other things, everything is purely relevant, but also everything is objectively one way or the other, but not at the same time until you notice, not at the same time. time until you open Schrodeger's box and then they collapse into one moment where certain positions obtain where there is a binary being discussed where you are not talk you're talking about a degree I I I that's why I think the fash pipeline stuff is very funny uh because um like I am foundation. opposed like I can tell you, I i think I can tell you, I feel more confident, I guess I'll say it this way, I got to maintain, even kill, I feel more confident, I feel that I could more confidently describe not why nazis are wrong than the people who put most effort into uh defeating them online, and the reason for that is because or the reason that they fight so hard against nazis online is because they know they're bad and they're right that they're bad, but they're not fully aware. of why they're bad, they only know some of the reasons and instead of pursuing them further for other specific reasons and specific influences, they flee from the question, and that is why they have to no platform, and that's why they have to, abolish the idea of anyone else, not create categories of unthinkable thought, because that's the only way that they can uh deal with the unresolved trauma of not having through what they believe, because they're right that nazis are categorically bad, but they got to that reasoning insufficiently, and so that leaves them with a lot of excess emotional energy around the name and the word and the idea of nazis that they unproductively direct emotionally, instead of where it would be more uh productively placed. all right guys, uh this has been pretty fun, i will be back on twitch tomorrow uh and yeah there's not the one hour time limit on twitch like there is on instagram so i think that'll be a fun one prob probably going to go a little long i might do some more graphs we'll see how i'm feeling uh but talk to you guys tomorrow should be should try trying to keep these around 6x o'clock uh unless things are intervening with the fym boys or i have something else to do uh but i will always i will try to do one every day i'm i'm gonna this is part of my daily practice so if you're going to still be here uh i will still be talking and like i said please get me back any questions you have because that's the only way I'm going to keep on this on the path of the beam here uh bye-bye.
