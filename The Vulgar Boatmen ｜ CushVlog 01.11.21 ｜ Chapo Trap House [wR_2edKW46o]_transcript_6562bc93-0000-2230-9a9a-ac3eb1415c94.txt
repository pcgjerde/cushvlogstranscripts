 better to car for fun heaven creeping down my back stairs sometimes i think it's the sand if i get again when i'm losing again i can see that now in a paint james ah sometimes i think it's a send when i think that i'm winning and i'm losing again sometimes to take care if i find you been creeping down my back stairs um hey folks so whose president i'm not sure i don't know probably trump i'm assuming i'll we haven't heard from him since he got kicked off of twitter and there's been no heard since not ominous at all of course and uh we've got a good indication that there's going to be further attempts to uh to act as some sort of web-based shock troop to uh push over the tottering coke machine of America. political uh system. I don't think that's likely. I think we'll see in the next month and inauguration day will definitely be the real uh, the real proving ground of this, a basically a whiff of grapeshot, anybody knows what that is, uh, it was one of the things that helped cement Napoleon's legend is when he was still just general uh, and had not yet even uh... I believe not had not even gone to uh Egypt yet, uh, he put down a right-wing royalist revolt uh that was threatening to lay siege to the national assembly, but with a well positioned uh artillery crossfire that drove the mob away from the building and saved the directory as though and uh As a result, Napoleon continued his ascension to power, and I got to say, the parallels don't just end there, in this also uh, very similar is the fact that the directory was a completely transactional uh, hollow cynical shell that had no popular legitimacy, so that's uh, certainly history rhyming again. but however it looks, i think that uh we're going to see these these ordinary whites uh disciplined, because one of the reasons that they're like this, one of the reasons that they could just walk into the capital and not think anything's going to be bad and think that they can just go home and no one's going to get arrested, is because nothing bad has ever really happened to these people before in their lives. now that doesn't mean they don't feel precarity and that doesn't mean they don't feel real anxiety about their station and worries about them the... future and their children's future, but in terms of like getting to do what they want, outside of course for the market if they're employees, i mean a lot of them as we have said are are uh you know small small business owners which means they feel autonomous all the time, but even the ones who uh work have ideologically you know screened that alienation uh and maintain their sense of self-assertion through their purchases and through their political activities which... been curtail and so now it's happening, if anyone saw the video of the uh person who was denied entry to a flight because they were on this new like uh, i guess um flight attendant insisted upon, no fly list for people who are identified having gone to it, and the guy wasn't yelling, the guy wasn't threatening to get his gun, he was crying, he was winning at the top of his fucking lungs, this is what they're doing me, sie of taloon is completely different, what are you talking about, sige of talloon was was like well, years earlier, you talking about, this is a whiff of grape shot after vendamir, jesus fucking christ, he's just crying, because he doesn't, it's like wait, consequences, and the majority of these people once they see, oh you can go to jail for this, oh there's actual consequences are going to back down, now they're not going to reconcile themselves to democracy into the the... Biden administration and they're not going to be chasene and like vote for Mitt Romney for the fucking nomination next time, but they're probably not going to be marching around so much with guns uh and but the one that's not going to be all of them of course, some of them are going to keep fighting and they will be at every level manipulated, monitored and encouraged by uh the fucking secret police so that we can keep this low-running insurgency going and justify uh further civil liberties destruction and create more spectacle for people to engage with uh while everything burns, but I wanted to uh, I was wrong about this at every stage. I mean, I, I'll admit I never thought they were going to fucking breach the capital, it's pretty amazing, but I mean, I'm sorry, if Biden becomes president, I was right, everything else buils down to anxiety, like, oh, I worried more than him before we got to this point, and there, and by the way, if I'm wrong and there is a fucking civil war or or or a coup, wouldn't that be good news, because at least it breaks this fucking endless stailmate, frankly, that's why I don't think it's going to happen more. than anything because it would actually break open this political uh structure here that has got us completely fucking cosited and you know what if i'm at the fucking getting firing squatted by some magget shit heads or uh or biden is nominated biden is sworn in and there's no problem either way if you spent more time worrying about it because you are more concerned than me and we're both in the same place we're both and son of the same firing squad, we're both watching the same stupid fucking state of the union where Biden has a stroke halfway through and all the democrats are clapping and they can't stop clapping and they all they're like fucking at a stallin speech at the polit Bureau because no one wants the first to stop clapping even though he's up there and druel is coming out of his mouth and he's been fucking stuck on the same syllable for 45 seconds wherever we are if we're there together and you spent more time worrying than me guess what i was right regardless of what i thought. because none of these people who want to fucking tell you how right they were about the fascist threat are doing anything other than settling scores online which means they're full of shit so anyway there's going to be some sort of graph and if not then let's stop fucking podcasting if not thank god we don't have to have takes anymore nobody act like that's a bad oh no what if they overthrow the government? then you got to fight for something in once in your fucking life and you can't fucking be on the internet all day and not including myself in this, oh my god, you don't have a fucking excuse to send your fucking ass for your entire fucking life, oh my god, that'd be the worst thing in the world, wouldn't it? i'm operating under the assumption that this machinery of coersion is that is so that is literally surrounded the earth is going to be more resilient than some fucking yokles. can put together, and if I'm wrong, then that is sweet fucking liberty from this goddamn the steel cage of fucking neutered sterolneurosis, so I'm sorry, if Bydon gets, Biden gets nominate, if Biden gets the sworn in and there's no cou, then guess what, I won cuz I wasn't spending this whole time shitting my fucking. out and scrolling on twitter non-stop, i really haven't been, i swear i have not been doom scrolling and i feel better for it, i win then you oh, i spent all this time shitting in a bucket over fear about this thing, you won, what did you win? you get to feel smug, congratulations, that's the entire currency we have here, so i don't like i said forget, forget forget what's going. happen, I just think broadly, there's going to be a a snap on the nose of these people and kind of for now, get them back into the column, although we'll talk about what that's going to mean long-term, and none of it is good, because none of any of this is good, which is why I never fucking understand the argument about why you need to be more worried about stuff, because well, it's not going to be a fascist coup, but it's still bad who in god's name is saying it isn't fucking bad. but i wanted to start today talking about some about like reinforcing sort of the the uh narrative of how we got to this place and how we created this class that revolted at uh at the at uh last week and these people who now are fully rejecting democratic governance because they have a fully in uh fully separate media consumptive window where they didn't lose the election where all of your entreaties to democracy and rule of law bounce off because they think that they're those things are on their side, like that is incommenserability at a level that cannot be resolved politically, which is why people talk about civil war, but like my get is this is America, most people are just gonna go home, especially if they can fucking go to a goddamn outback in a couple of months, they're gonna go home, not all of them, but enough to avoid a con apocalyptic confrontation with the state. so how do we get here with these this republican base here? and i don't want to talk about whether the fucking left uh, one of the most annoying conversations you can have about is trying to understand the class character of these people, oh they're working class, no they got they drove there and they took planes, they're rich, it's not one or the other, it's it's a whole strata, it's the middle strata, and also they're not working class, no shit they aren't, nobody in america is. we don't have class consciousness so we don't have a working class people, we have people who work for wages, but they do not, especially these people, if they are technically working class, they sure shit don't think of themselves as workers, they think of themselves if as anything, americans or consumers, which mean basically the same thing, but what's more important than their class character, which is meaningless in this context, is there uh demographic character specifically um the places that they live uh and the the jobs they do there not necessarily workers like I said a lot of small business people but anyway the reason that we have this now this this class of people are in revolt even they are as people like to point out, relatively comfortable compared to people in this country who are suffering much worse in these conditions, but are hyper anxious and aware of their deprivation, which is relative, but that's the only thing anybody feels is their relative deprivation, and then they feel a a bone deep confidence in their ability to exercise political influence and change that, they want to speak to the manager because their entire life, the manager has shown up and given them what they wanted, but they're pissed, how do you deal with this? and then you've got the democrats as the opposition and their party made up of some of the people who are struggling the most in this country and some and most most now of the uh most educated and wellest off Americans uh um Ronald Reagan won 80 of the 100 countries with the highest degree of bachelor degree or higher attainment. Trump won 12 of them. That's a real thing that's happening, and and this democratic alternative, which is just the same thing Republicans are pushing for, but more culturally inclusive, uh, is the only alternative to it, how how? can this be? so let's start by just pointing out that there's two that uh two types of capital formations emerged in America while it was being settled. you had finance capital concentrated on the coastal cities, and then you had physical capital, before the civil war, primarily in the form of plantation slave agriculture and some uh manufacturing in the north. and then over the course of... the post war era, the end of slavery, and then the expansion westward, we get the poliferation across the country of regional economies that all are fed and then feed back into the national economy, which is still headquartered on those east coast cities, and this sends the uh the fortunate sons and daughters of uh of the bounty of America's conquest, um, into spacial and cultural directions, so if you are in one of those eastern cities with finance capital as it's uh raise on debt, you are growing up in a condition around people who are not necessarily only uh financiers, not necessarily only capitalists, but also the handmaidens of capital, lawyers, university professors, politicians, people who will become the... how to coordinate a national economy that requires expertise and that requires school and it requires manners, it requires civilized civilization in the European sense, and that over the course of the 20th century, meant that the uh, both middle and working class striving uh, people who were able to access our huge expansion of um, access to higher education after World War II, uh, had a choice of how do they want to pursue the bounty of America, they could go east, and I say east, I really just mean to a city because the cities they those centers of finance and and and capital, they pop up across the country, uh, you go to the cities, you go to college, you get a degree and you go to the cities to either make your fortune in in with the money itself, or make uh your profession around the money. but that while that's happening, while there's this flow of people to the cities like this, there are regional physic uh, physical capital production facilities and and and uh networks of of commerce that are fixed that don't go anywhere and that don't and that only interact with finance capital and then global capital as debters essentially as as people who the the ones were there to give you uh liquidity. so that you can expand and who you owe, essentially the the old banks that the daxonians were terrified out, those regional um uh capital, finance capital uh economies around first and for most extraction, mining, drilling, fracking, things like that, also retail to serve all the people who work in those uh industries uh and then all the attendant you know it it creates its own own parallel economy filled with small business people uh and hustlers like lawyers in both places but lawyers doing different things finance like a financial planners in both places doing different things but in different culturess and after uh the working class was brought into uh the... the political arena with the new deal after working class got a seat at the table as it were uh the first explosion of uh of reactionary sentiment which is basically just a restating of the old jacksonian and jeffersonian concept of the totally unfettered uh citizen the the idea that American liberty is only real if it is if if it is uh uh without any um any sovereign beyond the individual and that it is just the accumulated actions of these sovereign individuals that makes up the country. when it exploded to as the antithesis to the thesis that it emerged from World War II of you the the Fortist Cansian new deal state which was a creation forged. in the laboratories of those big cities by finance capital because oh we have this industrial economy but these workers are organized and if they don't work we can't fucking get this stuff out we have a war to win we have a a global war over like the resources of the planet to win what are we going to do we have the money let's give it to them for the love of god let's recognize them let's get them on the board here let's get them in the tent pissing out because we can afford to and they were making all these deals and the and the i'm not i swear to god i'm not uncoke. swear to christ, i understand you won't believe me, but i'm not on cocaine. um, so those deals are being made there within the upper ranks of both the democratic and republican parties, but then at the grassroots in these places where there's like a local uh candy manufacturer, Robert Welts, the founder of the Johnt society was a candy manufacturer in western Massachusetts, uh, in orange County. amongst the uh like the notsberry farm fortune or all the aerospace engineers to came to work for uh boing um in the sunbelts you know wherever it is it emerged and and then of course in the south in response to uh uh inigration in every place the revolt to the new deal consensus uh came from at the top regional uh super super successful version of them, they were like the alphas of them because their money is in fucking oil, it's in the ground, they're not for not, they're not bankers and Trump supporters among the billionaires, the lump and billionaires who support tend to be, who support Trump tend to be not on the finance side, but on the physical capital side, and um, so you know, oh, um, fast food franchise owners, uh, car dealership owners, like the buddy garedy types, we know the beautiful boters, local gentry, they are the ones that rebel because they're not in on the... meetings, they don't get, they are not s, they've not been consulted on the Bretton Wood system and fucking marshall plan, they've not been consulted on integration either, which is another thing that had to happen so that we could keep the money flowing and we could be keep beat the soviets, but you can't talk sense to them because they're not in the room, they're they're out in the hinterlands and they have their own cultures and they don't interact really with those eastern ones except as something to define oneself against, so there's no persuading them even though it's in their best interest, because another part is it's not a all their best interests, the more successful ones over time will be like brought into and by and be bought out maybe at the right time, but the tendency towards monopoly is real, and these small gentry are going to be crushed over time, and they are being crushed over time, and like if they don't if they're not smart, and a lot of them are not fucking smart, and lucky, and very few of us are lucky or like half of us are not lucky at any given moment, uh, they're going to get crushed too, and they're going to get proletarianized, and they don't want it, they never wanted it, so in addition to the fact. that they're culturally separated enough just to never buy any argument for why we should be doing this globalizing economy, they also are very well, they very well might not might be in conflict with it, just like all those factory owners, workers who are told that nafta would be worth it because hey, you're going to have much cheaper socks at Walmart and if you lose your job we'll give you we'll teach you how to code. and that new right was in abayance for the 50s and early 60s because things were good, times were good, it was working for most people, when it broke up, it broke out of the cultural ferment of the the essentially overheating of the cultural economy that caused that came from having too many young people with too much time on their hands because literally the economy was too good, and that is where you get, you know uh, you get social ferment and active. and attempts to change things, because you have people who are increasingly articulate and able to make demands on on uh the political system and are able to organize themselves, and while the 60's counterculturals were doing that, so was this local business roundtable uh lump in bourjois revellion, and it eventually took power in the form of Reagan. now the thing is, these people were resisting global capital, but they're still. capitalists and also they're fucking morahans, most of them, and at the level, and at the political level, when you're not even trying to talk to people who like have looked at the the sheets, the the the economy or anything are just reading the newspaper and don't have any more you know understanding of the world than anybody else when you're getting it through capitalist bullshit media. when Reagan was elected, it was with a promise that even though it looked like the American economy had stalled out permanently in the 70s. "we could get it going again, not by seasing the means of production and redistributing profit, which is the only thing that was going to do it, that was off the table because the working class had lost its influence by that point and couldn't regain it, there was an attempt, the 70s saw the biggest wave of wild cat strikes since the since the late 40s, it was like the the birth and death pangs of like business liberalism uh uh and our business um unionism in America were uh with the post war'. strike wave and then with the 70 strike wave, but it failed, and what it meant was you had neoliberal uh democrats like uh, Jimmy Carter who wanted to tell all the people, white, black, whatever, look, uh, yeah, we can't rely on indulgence, we can't rely on stuff we buy to make us happy anymore, now that's all true, what he said, but he wasn't doing anything to change the structure of the economy that made people have to find pleasure in goods because their... were totally alienated otherwise, he was essentially just telling them to pull up their fucking bootstraps, it's classic the poison chalce of of liberal piety right there, but who is listening, who was listening, every uh, every white middle class and up person who had at some point either them or their parents had made the track from the hinterland to the colleges and to the cities or the suburbs of the cities to work around the money, either in the state or in its cultural departments and they had they were going to do good because part of this deal was we got here not because of the... physical productivity of the land, we got here because we can use our brains to interface with this new data economy, this post this consumer data economy. now of course they weren't smarter than anybody, what they were was well positioned some way to accede to the manners and social mores of college, probably because their parents went uh, or because they were like uniquely uh suited for them for reasons that had nothing to do with their virtue and never. do, but one way or another they were in a position to thrive regardless, and so of course they said, yes, there's a lot here, very interesting, uh, but Reagan's answer was, what's restraining America's economy, is all of the stuff that makes the economy possible, it's all the structures of uh, regulation and taxation that literally allow the thing to function, the stuff it took us 200 years to build because the thing kept breaking down, there were like six giant depressions and a civil war in the 19th century, and then we had a depression that led to massive social misery and turmult, and then only ended when we decided to become the world the spanning fucking hegemon, and then we had this this thing that looked beautiful, this cansian synthesis, but it was predicated on prophets that overtime... fell as we had to build up our former enemies, we had the Soviets there, we couldn't let Japan and Germany language, which meant eventually they were going to start making stuff, and once they did, our bloated carcass of a of a of a um automobile industry, which had made itself uncompetitive, which had essentially castrated itself to avoid being overtaken by its workforce, like one of the big reasons that the uh big three were unable. to adapt to the smaller, more energy efficient vehicles coming out of Japan in the 70s, is that the facilities that they'd had to like um to uh to make a workflows and and part you know movement like getting a thing from a - get getting winshiel wipers from a flant to to the finishing area or whatever had been intentionally dispersed right after they made the deals with the uaw uh in the 30s and 40s in order to make it harder for um the unions to secure crucial choke points of production. one of the reasons, one of the things that that led to is that when it came time to figure out what to do with the new economic order, they they were unable to, but anyway, the chickens were coming home to roost, and America was either going to have to socialize production, or if it was going to maintain a profit-based economy, it was going to have to dismember the very structure of new deal governance that has allowed it to thrive, and "if you're one of these small holders or people in their thrall, people who live in the same cultural area, maybe work for them, but havied the idea of America, America is good, therefore my boss is good, therefore if anything's wrong, it's something else. Reagan was able to say all that, that's something else that is alienation and anxiety and precarity, however it's felt across the class rectum, is caused by the government holding us back, like fry when he's trying to drink the slurm and he's trying to get his head through the grate and he goes, I could get there easily if it wasn't for these damn arms and then started chewing them off, and that no shit was more electorally appealing than Carter saying put on a sweater. now of course you might say, hey, maybe revolution would have been more appealing, but there was nobody there by that point, because labor had been demobilized, bought off and scattered by that point. so for a while. though the Reagan scam worked, it was a classic ponzi scheme in the American sense, oh yeah, we're going to cut taxes, oh shit our cities have destroyed themselves, our cities are turned into a complete bomb cells, and we oh that's okay, that's because of the black people, they like drugs too much, we'll throw them all in jail, uh, but your your places are still great because you've got mortgage uh uh mortgage deductions and we've essentially silently reconfigured the welfare state to give you silent subsidies that you don't even know are there and that make you think that you're a fucking world destriding business genius and not a costted little baby being kept in a swattle blanket because the white middle class is the center of American politics and always has been it is not driving the caboose of course capital is doing that but it has a crucial like load bearing structure and it its movement can shift positions like it was the working class we're able to get a good chunk of small holders to go along with the new deal. "they will follow a strong hand, and that can be the the lefts, but in America it's been mostly the rights, and so well, the uh, the..." end of prosperity 70s, like I said last stream, what that meant for uh African-Americans was just base repression, like you never actually gotten to the point of political equality, and now we can keep you as sussentially contained, like we give you enough power and influence to maintain patronage, maintain a middle middle class, but anybody who's like falls out of that uh structure, and there's going to be a lot cuuse we never built up any actual you know uh capacity. capacity there uh we're going to just throw your joil and what are you going to do? where are you going to complain? what are you going to do? you just had a big complaint, you just got a bunch of laws passed, all the white people are sick of hearing of it, and what are you going to do? one, the republican party is deciding to be against you, you can't go there, so what are you going to do? you're captured by the democrats and it's tough shit. the the white people is a much different problem. now the democrats, their new base of white people, that was set. they they're signed up, yeah, yeah, sure, knowledge, economy, great, go, i'll go to college, learn a code, we'll do it, and they went to college and they got the jobs, now some of them now are finding out, oh no, yeah, that's all bullshit, now and that's the thing, now the check is coming do, even those cassed uh, regional lords and their vassals are not feeling the pinch, like trump did very well, very, very well in countries with high uh fentinill overdoses, now of course he didn't do well against the people who suffered those fetalil are their families, they don't vote, but they did very well among the wealthiest people who live there, because they're seeing it, it's their community and they're unhappy about it, and so they have because but because this is like a a petty national, reactionary uh capitalist movement, this is essentially a baren's revolt from a bunch of of pig-headed like feudal lords who have not got it in their head that there's one team here called capitalism. but because they're embedded in their social structures and their and their fake class affect of i i drive a truck and i listen to country music so i'm basically the same guy as the one is the dude mows my lawn and he thinks that's so that too because i'm dressed like him and we're all living this lie together and who's going to tell us what we're wrong the fucking the the the the the gay jews on the television they're not going to tell me anything there's nothing they can do to break my bubble we're in here together and we're suffering together and so what is to be done and they are taking the Reaganite conclusion to Jefferson and Jackson logic which is end the state and if you like ask these people like, okay, what should Trump do, what is Trump going to do to fix things, now you might say some people like in the base say freemal healthcare, whatever, that's that's not, that's never going to be the the um the place where policy is formed, because remember at the top rank of these people we're talking about these beautiful boater classes, this petty bourgeois, these bears. these these are also people who end up going to congress and be and like running for senate and becoming fucking senators as their kids are so they are also the political class of the republican party like these are this the party and this class is almost fused it's the same people and that means that they're going to dictate what the response to this horror is this is neoliberal capitalism rolling over everybody how do we stop it? their answer will be allow us all the unrestrained power of bearance, because the barried assumption within all the few the fantasy of the Jeffersonian model is, well if you everybody can do it, and of course no, it will concentrate where it always does, the money and power will stay where they are, but the people under it, in the thrall of it, within the cultural bubble of it, will accept it because they could one day break out themselves if they work hard enough, i mean it is a theology and they fully embrace it and it is connected. and grafted onto christianity at the fucking root. so what is the Trumpian and post-trumpian uh uh political project if there is one, and of course there really isn't it is just spectacle, but say they can't they actually are able to assert uh and at the state level they very well might be like regardless of whether Biden gets in, i don't think you see him ruling for four years without some sort of nullification crisis, somebody like the santis or Greg Abbot ralleling sabers about uh refusing to uh uh accept federal laws, so you could see the like just being in the near future some sort of attempt to assert like a Trumpian social vision, it's not going to be Here and Volk democracy, it will be get rid of all taxes, get rid of all restrictions on pollution, uh on drilling anything uh and get rid of all restraint on uh any sort of inter uh like consumer-based protection uh for any... financial or uh or physical product, like let lead filled baby food, whatever, let the market decide, um, and because the pitch there is, with all restrictions lifted, if we assume capitalism and everything is assumed of capitalism, so the alternative to this that does, i mean and you can't blame them too much for not believing that this could exist, because no one is talking about it, especially the fucking democrats, if capitalism is is it, do we submit to being turned into soy creatures, do we submit to this regime and says, look, we're going to strip mine the earth, but we're going to do it politely and an en orderly fashion, and we all keep voting and we all pretend to respect each other's religious and and uh ethnic diversity and by the way, you now don't own your business anymore, you work for Amazon, you don't have any health insurance, that's just the way it is, you could code, if you you want to learn how to code grandpa, you want to sit in class all day junior to learn how to fucking code even though, like that isn't for everybody, people, there are people who are not uh for college and not for the kind of jobs that you're supposed to want to get, and of course even if everyone was, there aren't enough. of them, there aren't enough of them, so that's what we're, that's what the democratic party, and now, after the Trump ban, the entirety of culture, the imono culture from tech industry and the tech monopolies to the democratic party to everything you see on television, that is one party, and it is for turning us all into into little uber eats minions, there is no socialist alternative. this in the discourse, what there is is this this uh incoherent jabbering nationalist white like uh racial nationalist version of it, not purely like white nationalist because it will it will it will by definition and for its own survival accept others outside of whiteness, but it will just do that by enhancing the s what whiteness means, but it's still part of it, like that's grafted in there, right there with the nationalism and the christianity, they're all wedged together and they all reinforce each other, what is the? what is the proposal instead of doing that? let's not let the cucks of the UN tell us how much oil we can drill, put everybody gets a fucking oil derric that they can try to find oil with, and everybody can fucking pump every surface of this earth because hey, it could be you that finds the next uh the next mother load. multi-level marketing schemes, no uh, no um regulations of those, anybody with enough hustle can get friends, to get friends, to get friends to uh to understand this incredible marketing opportunity. It's okay though, yes, you're still a minion, most of you, the ones who warent in iron uh, iron in compounds, most of you are still a rabbit-like peasant, but uh, at least you could be a Lord, as opposed to the the the jerbal in the soy plantation who has accepted his lot in life. and what despairs makes me filled with despair about more than anything is is that now that we have this like now that after they banned Donald, it's all out there, there is one agenda, there is one party, there is an establishment, there is an elite, everything the Q ever said about that is true, it's just it's everybody, except what is the undigestible? what's the thing the system cannot absorb? what has to be rejected, what has to be denounced, everything else seems to be acceptable, including black lives matter, including all manners of of socialism, what cannot be absorbed? trump, and so what is that say to the people absorbing the spectacle? that the only alternative to the misery of the moment is trump, no matter how incoherent it is, and stupid and cruel, it is. i mean, look at what is, what is trump's real legacy in these last month? he hasn't really been planning a coup, he's just been like hoping somebody else would do it, what he has been doing is making sure that they fucking execute everybody on the federal death row, that's the heart of this, it's just fucking it's feudalism, like the choices really is, it's it's two brands of barb barbarism, it is old fashion feudalism in the American sense, like you know the plantation master and his thralls and then the pathetic oversier in the middle trying to uh negotiate the two, and then we have... techno feudalism where there is no ostentatious displays of public violence and sadism and domination, they're all done behind the scenes, they're all covered by fucking ones and zeros, they're all hidden, we are all too polite to mention them, but it's feudalism in both cases, it's barbarism in both cases, and then the alternative to that is this just, yeah, the alternative is just this savagery, and I am not becoming post. leftified because I am saying that sucks and it is the goal, the only meaningful fucking point of the left at this juncture is to actually manifest a fucking alternative to this, and the only thing I will say about that is it will not be by posting, and it will not be by monitoring people's anxiety levels and it will about be curating ideologies in the hot house of online and building your fucking uh ship in a bottle, it will have to come from actual, dare i hate to say it, organizing, and you say, what does that mean? it's sure shit, nothing I'm seeing on the internet, which thank god, it should... be, it should be people working together, it's going to, and it's going to have to happen, and i hope it will, or else all the coming misery that's going to break our fantasy of endless indulgence, that the myth that Greg Grandon talks about be finally dispelled, any hope that that alienation and and pain goes to the goes to fill the ranks of opposition to capitalism. uh, that goes away, if the only alternative to the system is trump, they'll find a way to absorb almost all of it, all of it that doesn't go into self-destructive despair or just pure a political violence, and the one thing that like can shine through this is that this is all spectacular politics and it's spectacular, it's spectacular nature is what allows it such purchase in people's minds because because like half those people at the fucking uh at the capital were streaming it for their fucking followers or had a t-shirt on that they you could buy at their etsi store everyone was selling each other stuff it was it's a giant tupperware party it's self-interested delusion the only thing they can defeat that is a self-interest that is fused to the self of others at the point of work and suffering, not at the point of arguing and metasuffering and discussing suffering, and finding a cultural costume for your suffering. so those are the vulgar boatmen, that's the class that we created, we created a regional bourjois that was never forced into full political uh acceptance of the the system because there was never any need, they were there making their money themselves, it didn't matter if they sponsored the Johnch socide or whatever, hey when they took office, it helped apply pressure from the right to break up a lot. the new deal stuff that uh capital needed to get rid of, they were very helpful, they were very, very helpful, and they still are, but only within the bounds, they have to be coralled, that's why I'm saying, I think there's going to be some sort of crackdown, a whiff of grapeshot, because they're only useful as long as everything is together, but man, seeing like the national fucking manufacturers association and like uh, dow and shit coming out and saying Trump got to go, that's not good. like if you are rooting for this because you think it's going to lead to some sort of working class trumpist alternative to the status quo, i'm sorry, if that's how it worked, if you could get the like base of a party to dictate to its to capital that at its top, without like fully organizing around a conflict with capital, uh, you're not going to, you're not going to beat them, you will be suborned. This party will be directed towards a incoherent giberish sort of national sort of almost like uh right-wing pull pot shit like destroy the cities shoot everybody with glasses and then instead of having everybody farm collectively for rice like have everybody um open their own like lulu lemon distributorship. but like what the Biden's gonna what Biden I think is gonna do I'm not going to predict you much but is if he's able to hold power and like the GoP doesn't just assert a veto. like every point, which they might do, like this whole uh impeachment thing is very interesting, because like as I said, this Trump energy is useful as long as it is you know maintaining because these high-level republicans have interests that are that transcend Trump, but if they think that there's a chance that the democrats could actually change the rules, because remember the only reason that the republicans are able to be the party they are, and have the appeal that they do, is because they have a Jerrymander and structurally uh and structurally mandated handicap essentially that. allows them to do that, if and that's all not, and that a lot of that is based on rules that could be resinded by a party in power, and that could actually threaten them, and especially if people are talking about like sending folks to jail, and that changes the fucking calculus, or it could, but I the democrats I don't think are going to press it that far, because who really wants them to do that, besides a bunch of fucking oped writers whose job it is to make the democrats look like a responsive fucking... uh meaningful resistance to uh authoritarian hell, instead of its simpering handmaidens. the republican party is S Tolliver, and the Democratic party is EB Farnam. I do wonder if somebody would ever will just slap Trump, like what if one of the joint chiefs of staff just hit him in the face, what would he do? buse you got to assume he's never been struck, but they wouldn't do that either bause they're a bunch of fucking dorks and they have no real interest in seeing this like ended, this should all be drawn out as long as possible, that's to the benefit of everybody, draw it out right to the end, then Trump leaves office, biden gets in there's some shots fired, uh, there's some bombs that go off, there's some shinanigans, there's a few big raids, and then everybody is just too fucking spent and anxious at the same time to do anything other than just be baby birds, as as it's dictated to us and as I was saying, I was distracted, but I think we might honestly see some sort of trial UBI here to stand in for everything else that needs to change, because it is the easy quick fix, that's what. Yang proposed it, and there is a basis now with the fucking uh, with the stimulus concept in just making a cyclical fucking payment, the substitute for effective vaccine distribution uh or any kind of uh healthcare counter measures, and that would be the path of least resistance because it doesn't really chafe anybody, all it does is is uh undermine your argument for uh deficit austerity which you need to have in order to beat back progressive demands, but it's at this point that's got to be like the one inessential item in your load out that you can jetison, but we'll see, we're i don't think we're getting anything else, that's for sure, and we're sure shit not going to get any kind of uh heard immunity for at least a year, oh that at least a year, two. but the big thing about this is that the entire democratic cultural response and this goes for everybody talking about how anxious they have to be and everybody talking about how they need to impeach to send the message that this is unacceptable. all that is premised on convincing people right? you're convincing the population to for example, support democrats against republicans as a stand-in to do what they always want people to do and put country first and make whether or not you support Trump a defining issue of whether or not you vote for a republican, like if some i will not vote for a republican who says trump uh should stay in office or didn't do anything wrong, and the thing is is that they can't win that, they can't make that happen, they can't make that work. because they're not speaking to those people, they're speaking to, here's the people they're speaking to, they're speaking to the democratic faithful outside of the whole thing uh are going to be yesserring to everything, take everything, yes, medicare for all is a good idea, but it is impractical, yes, we do need to be realistic about what we can accomplish given republican opposition, they're just there to go, then there's the people who you could theoretically engage to change the numbers, the ones who do don't vote or don't identify as partisan, but them it's mostly gammer rays because they don't think this shit matters because they've never seen it mean anything in their lives, they have no emotional connection to the symbology that the liberals do because it is not the deal has not worked out for them the way it has for the liberals, and then you have the people in the fucking republican cocoon, for whom everything they get outside of it, all the norms, all the norm assertions, every statement by every big company, none of that like makes them go, oh these things i like don't like this, maybe i'm wrong, they say oh "this is a fucking conspiracy, this is literally the elite telling you that democracy isn't real, because remember, they all think Trump won on an emotional level, even if they couldn't explain why they are motivated emotionally by a belief that Trump is the legitimate president, maybe it isn't, maybe it's be deeper than than uh believing that he won the election, like they might be think a lot of them that the people we have vote mostly shouldn't be allowed to." and that means that they don't, whatever the justification is, the end result is that none of these entreeties to norms, none of these entreeties to higher ideals will penetrate that bubble, which means there can be no uh threat, there could be no democratic uh like assertion of authority in the halls of congress, no no ability to to cow the republicans into doing things, because between now and then how many people have stopped caring and the people will care are going to be the same people are always there and now we know a lot of these working class people who waren't paying attention are now kind of siding with trump i mean imagine imagine this imagine trump was your first fucking election you never voted before think of it this way never and there's a lot of people like this you never voted for four but this time holy shit big stuff's happening kind of crazy what's? going on, i don't know, no one seems to know, the like there's no clear story, mass are good, mass are bad, but now they're good and something about the chinese, i don't know, but i do know that i lost my job or family member died of covid or can't go to my favorite bar anymore or you, i lost my health insurance or something, shit, what the hell's going on? you've got this political establishment that is unified in its message, like remember the biden and trump didn't argue about any actual. difference in policy about covid or anything else, they agreed on the basic hybrid thing of lockdowns when you need and then open things when you can and uh mostly make it people's personal responsibility to wear a mask and then give people money some money to uh make up the shortfalls instead of shutting everything down and letting people stay home and paying them uh trying to fucking cut it off, no maintaining the fucking economy at all. that was the bipartisant answer, so that's not the major difference, but you do have one guy there who all of the people other people in charge, all the media, all the big institutions say is bad and is fact uniquely bad and is beyond bad and it's terrible and oh my god, now what he's saying is mostly jibrish, but what biden is saying is mostly jibrish, but trump's gibrish is apparently dangerous, then there's an election, biden wins, looks like he won, but i don't know. Who are you supposed to know? this is the media who's fucking behind any of this stuff, but they're kicking him out, they're uh, they're they're kicking him off twitter and off facebook, what, what is he a threat to? because remember, these people outside of the dem enthrallment do not credit the democrats. or the fucking constitutional order or or the media or anything for any good thing in life, nor should they? and it's insanely frustrating that you've got all these people who decided that you know you might actually need to have public ownership of public goods, instead of having like monopoly capitalists being able to to veto your access to crucial infrastructure? yeah, maybe think about that beyond the thing you used to post beyond thinking, we need to fucking nationalize the internet so that my grandkids uh are forced to like my facebook means that is how this is why I'm saying there could be no constructive politics with these people because it is all the most selfish brain dead entitled dog shit on earth because they are the most coddled people in human history so their prescriptions for problems are the most self uh self uh reinforcing and uh um self-validating, self-absolving, shit on earth, i want to bring back uh I want to bring back executions in the streets uh and and uh no income tax. healthcare is by lottery, but you know it's it's legal for me to sell um moonshine that i cut with anti-frese. this like the culture they're defending, the national culture they're defending against the encroaching uh uh globalists, which is how a lot of people like to phrase it, they like to say, this is a national... cultural, this is an embedded cultural uh unit that is rebelling against uh encroaching capitalism, you know, like think of all those think of that the planes Indians and you know um and uh peasant Europe and think of the enclossures, no these people are already totally consumerized pringles, they were already processed dog shit, and so their culture is processed dog shit and the thing they're trying to hold and be able to maintain is dog shit. now there's no hope there and the idea of oh, i'm going to direct them in the right way, i'm going to like convince them that my fucking thin ass uh reed of of a cod marxist uh jargon college jargon is going to be more persuasive than the fucking visceral imagery of the American flag or the confederate flag for that. matter and like the pageanttry uh and uh and certainty and religious fervor of this, your fucking nerdy ass fucking policy bullshit is going to cut through that, especially since all of the money will be arrayed against you, all of the money that is within those you know remaining sectors, dumb ass, like it's hilarious watching people who make fun of Aoc and of people who take Aoc serious. say oh you're a fucking rube, i can't believe you idiots, and then make fun of uh all of the high-paid media hacks who pretend to criticize the democrats but actually sheep dip them back into voting for democrats, how many of them are are fucking convincing themselves right now, well maybe not right now we'll see that like josh hawley is it's like the the guy who is going to uh you know awaken the sandworm and and bring class politics to this like jibbering reactionary petty bourgeois tantrum. That's a fantasy as rich and you have to be either well-paid or hoping you'll get well-paid by by uh flattering an audience that wants to be reinforced in their worldview already uh or you're just deluted. There is no hope in either of these parties, my friends, the the things they represent are two flavors of shit sickle. and I mean like I mean that's obviously a very glib thing to say oh the turd sandwich in the shit the ship taco or I don't even remember the stupid South Park but you know the truth or falseness of that is never in doubt they always were by definition they are but whether or not that matters determined is determined by the context of the of the contest like I'd say like a 64 election like that's a real 32 that's a real distinction even if you're both talking you're talking about real uh, you know, a bipartisan capitalist super uh structure undergirding it, but right now everything is accelerating towards shit, every all conflict is in the benefit of both parties, exacerbating conflict is in everyone's best interests, at least to the point that they think that they can overtake it, like the democrats, they're aware there's a point where they might bluff beyond their capacity, and then we could see them get slapped out, and they don't want to risk that and That's why I doubt they'll uh impeach Trump, because they don't want to be shown to be holding a weak hand, because what they want, their fantasy, the fantasy of all liberals is at this moment those guys in the guy with the horns at the at the rostrorum, that image is the 911 that gives them the whip hand during a uh um during a moment of national catastrophe, the same way that 9/11 did for the republicans, that is the dream of the democrats and the signal and the evidence of that is going to boil down to how many republicans break ranks, how many republicans denounce Trump, how many republicans say, yeah, no, this is too far, and signal that they're willing to, you know, uh, cut towards the democrats, which has been what they've been trying to do, break the regular republicans away from the base, that's been the goal since uh, Clinton, got the nomination and Trump and was running against Trump, and this is another chance for them to do that, but if they do a vote, and the Republicans are essentially uh, unified. all the all they have demonstrated is that the democrats have no actual ability to govern and that biden will in fact being having his policies dictated by Mitch McConnell. and I just don't think the democrats want to find out, I think they're too afraid, so that's why I doubt they'll do it, they might, I'm not going to say they won't, it's just right now, my guess is they don't want to see, they don't want to show how weak their hand is, they want to leave it in the air so that scared republicans could like start really freaking out, oh get some of those pulls out there showing how many people were opposed to the to the uh attack on the thing, thing is though, all those fucking all of the... almost all of those republicans in the house are in Jerrymander districts where the majority of voters there supported all this shit and think it's awesome and will vote for any fucking used car dealer who runs against you saying he voted to kick the president out or he voted to certify the whatever and they don't want to show that they don't want to have that out there they want to have it out there as a possibility. Yeah, it's like the Republicans after the civil war wave the bloody shirt and it worked great because most people like who lived in the northern states which had the enough electoral votes to determine the president if they stayed unified had been shot by southerners uh or had shot a southerner who was likely a democrat, so that bloody shirt was real, this is how... just a spectacle, this is all just kind of funny, this is all just pretty fucking funny, and by the way, wanted to say this too, anybody who after Trump got fucking uh perma banned was like, this is really serious, yeah, but I'm sorry, I treat that the same way that I treat the people that say, you have to take the fucking cou seriously, we let the tech companies take over everything, that already happened. but this is just the validation of that, having the having it come in the form of President Donald Trump being fucking permaban is hilarious, and thinking it's not hilarious doesn't change the facts on the ground, just like thinking that the fucking uh duffman going repelling from the roof of the fucking congress and stealing Aoc shoes, is it funny? I'm sorry, that's very funny. It's so funny because I remember from the Bush years, it has been a longstanding uh project by the intellectual left liberals uh oped columnist types and and the the nation writer types that that the republican party is an existential threat to democratic uh governance in America and that therefore it has to be destroyed in its current form, you see this a lot, many people have made this argument over the years, it's only gotten more intense in the last few. but the way but that is impossible given the current uh uh lay given the current layout of like American political power. the big empty places in this country were all of those the smart all of the smart college uh like sensitive types departed all the ones who went on to become the the the b the the white middle class base of the and upper class base of the democratic party that they went out there, the ones who stayed, they stayed in places that are disproportionately electorally powerful, the democratic party with its play towards the same base of middle class, like self-understood, forgetting their actual jobs, self-conceived of as middle class white Americans, mostly white Americans, with like black people as this uh permanent adjunct to the democratic coalition, and like uh Latinos and Asians sort of... being in in the in the middle strata, you can't, and then a bigger and bigger chunk of people deciding the politics doesn't matter and checking out, you cannot have, you cannot destroy the republican party in those conditions, anymore than the wig party or any more than the Democratic party could destroy the wig party, the wig party had to be destroyed from outside, it had to be destroyed by people, withdrawing their support for it, in concentrated. ways and then taking that uh power or taking that uh support and concentrating it somewhere else what am i talking about the only place is the midwest where am i wrong about this is the rural parts of this country are filled more and more with reactionary white people of all job descriptions whether working class middle class or local baron. and then black people as a hegemonic part of the democratic coalition and then that's and then those places where those votes predominate, those white middle-class votes predominate are in places with a lot of electoral power, it's a 50/50, it's a 50-50 split, you're never going to be able to overthrow the democratic republican party within this uh array of horses, something has to come outside of it and break through both parties support bases, that's the only thing that's going to do it, and in this current moment, which activate a vast chunk of people who do not fucking vote, and the key the reason that I think that means that we cannot be thinking anything that exists currently online is going to work, is that I really do feel like this is all poisoned well, this is all, this is all a mad uh language we've. hot each other in this self-imposed sanitarium, and then once we try to go outside into the sunlight we're going to sound like jabbering mental patients. that's my real belief. you got to get the normals to start talking about it, and you and if you can be normal with them, then by god go and do it. i know that's abilist, but guess what i get to say abolist stuff because i'm actually disabled. i'm like a large. chunk of the people who consider themselves disabled activists, a lot of whom have self-diagnosed uh conditions, i have like four distinct disabilities, so i get to say that, all right guys, peace.
