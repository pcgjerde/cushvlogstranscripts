 There i am, sorry to take you away from those lovely little fluffy guys down there, apparently uh, it was look like critter chat was was having a good time, but felt like I should stream today, might not be able to do it this weekend, so I want to try to do it today and tomorrow. if anyone's watching, which I assume they are, although I'm not getting any comments yet. I'll just start talking. Uh, I wanted to start today by remembering Michael Brooks, who's uh, whose, everything everyone is saying about him is true, so I don't feel like there's any need to uh, be redundant, just know that the outpooring uh of affection for him. was totally warranted and losing someone like that in that way is is really scary in its own way and and reminds you just how uh how lonely everything is but uh we're still here and uh for now and our the best way to honor him is to do what he wanted people to do which was god damn it, be kind to each other, god fucking damn it, be kind. i really appreciated that about him is that he understood that that the the uh reward, the reward mindset and the the value system incolcated by by online, even among people who who really truly want what's best for everyone just reduces everyone to the cruelest version of themselves. and the least generous and that there's no way to build a movement around that kind of uh mindset, so so yeah, rest and power is they say, michael uh, i've only was on a show a few times, but it was always really really fun, and he clearly uh, he did a lot. more work for it than fucking i ever have and he was more prepared, he certainly knew more about uh developments and other countries than i ever did uh yeah oh and when when someone like that's gone you can always then look back and wish you you know been closer but we only not we know. Henry Kissinger still alive though, that's kind of funny, and uh, Bolsonaro has had has had COVID four times and been attacked by two or three large birds, guy will never die, because god, I e the demi-urge, IE, the the enforced. social order and material realm loves human evil, rewards it basically, which is why this is a world that's not fit for real human beings, because it's not made for human beings, it's made for lizards, folks, it's made for people who are able to make the choice to strip themselves of everything that makes them human, uh, It makes me think of how the neoclassical economic or the neoclassical economic resurgence and then uh takeover basically of the economic field after the 70s coincidentally around the same time that you know the uh post-war labor consensus broke and private money just started flushing into every propaganda valve known to man just so happens at that point everyone realizes actually peuns aren't social animals humans are self-interested economic agents uh that was that was the very idea of that really like to to to put that forward as not the horrifying uh spiritual deformations caused by having to live under capitalism because that's the thing that the the the economic the the the ne classical description of the individual uh, that is what is incentivized by the market, and people do better, the better they treat themselves as one of those, but that is not humanity flurish. that's not humanity finding its meaning and purpose, that is to even suggest that is is like a deep level, like like just evil and and demorical just like a enchantment from the brimstone pit to suggest that the human that humanity is somehow uh more fully felt the more that it's isolated, the more that... it's delusionally fixated on satisfying its own ego, terrifying, and the recipe, a world where people are like that, is the world like the one we have now, and economists like to look around and smuggly look at that and say, see, this is what people are like, it's like, no, this is the system that you are disgusting intellectual handmaiden for, this is what it turns people into, like how the hell you you're an individual self-motivated agent, if that was the true, why are anybody? why is anyone alive? why do people raise children? why do people impart, why why does anything exist? why is there any social fabric to be pulled apart by capitalism for in the first place? how was it fixed? how was it built into being? cultural marxists in the babylonian times? fow out of here. but even if you could be what they want you to be, and of course there's a there's a zillion examples of why no one is rational and that no one can know their own self-interest well enough to operate from it successfully beyond any of that, even if you could, what the fuck is your self-interest? what is your self-interest accumulating? more than other people around you in a world where you're connected and tethered to e other every other human being on earth by deep ties of uh of of I mean sharing a mutual ecology and a world together uh each of you contributing in your smallest possible way to the full flower of like human civilization and culture, that's all humans rubbing against each other, that's all humans collaborating. at every moment and to say, I'm going to make my life, and everyone should make my their life about accumulating as much material distinction from everyone else as possible, what is, I mean, that's a recipe for planetary annihilation, that's a recipe for human beings ending, uh, ending life on this planet, self-interest, the self unbound by its social context is not a thing, the thing that's you, the thing that isn't culture, the thing that isn't other people is a whisper, it's a fragment, it might not even really exist, and trying to and teaching people that it's not that the... it is true that that is in fact the entirety of the of your sense, your ego, the entirety of yourself to have an interest, psychotic, psychotic, genuinely, i mean in that you you you are eventually forced to a point where the world is you understand it and the world is exists becomes so disperate that your brain breaks and we're clearly there now, people's brains have been snapped in like kindling by trying to live in a world. like the people for example, they thought they lived in the United States, they really really have an idea in their head of what the United States is, and and and their place in it as self-actualized individual consumers, and now they find themselves living in whatever the fuck this is, how the hell are they supposed to make sense of that? go and create a fantasy. narrative that connects the two things, that's what everybody is doing to some extent or another, creating a fantasy, that's what ideology is fixing the two things together with like you're trying to move a bike in the back of a car or something, connecting your perception of the universe, what what your what your baseline understanding of it is with the world that you actually live in, because for one reason or another you refuse to examine those basic. Baseline principles. I mean there is a self-interest that is social, like that's what that's the whole idea of class coming into itself is in Marx is, it's not a person acting in their own, under their own interest because that's absurd, it's a class of people operating under their own interests because they understand their mutual, their mutual uh shared condition of oppression, and that's the real thing, it is a condition of oppression being... uh being defeated by coordinated action, it's not, it it it, it manifests itself sometimes as material deprivation, but that's not the core of it, the core of it is species being alienation caused by fucking wage system. I wanted, I was thinking uh about the masks and it seems like even the Tecop people even the conservatives are now starting to wear the mask cuz Trump is now wearing the mask, although apparently people were very unhappy with that tweet, which by the way was clearly not him, it was one of those ones where you can tell it was scavino, which means that they probably asked him to do a pro mask tweet because it's clearly one of the few things that we have right now that could potentially stop the uh just un' insanely uh terrifying upward trajectory of covid infections uh and the the best they could do is just have him ghost write something and have him press tweet under it uh so but i bet he still won't mostly be seen in public wearing one but the it's going to be interesting seeing people come to terms with it because uh i saw a lot of i've seen a lot of people baffled by the people who get psychotically angry about the mask and refusing not and refusing to wear it in public and like having a spitting fits freaking out, I mean of course half of that at least you can just chock up to people trying to go viral and be epic. I think people need to really really, they are underestimating every time one of any kind of viral video comes over the transum, the insane incentive structure of people going viral in one way or the other, it's not like there's any difference between good and bad publicity anymore, so either side of any of these conflicts could literally just be someone being epic and getting uh and wanting to get some of that precious cloud, which as as I've said, cloud chasing is just, it's another form of being living in the gig economy, it's just one more element of the gig economy uh is is trying to get the cloud online to supplement income, replace income, have people be there for you when you need a medical bill paid, so I understand that, but the incentive structure is so overwhelming in one direction, that half this shit is probably people being epic and being. but forget that when people, but there really are clearly true examples all across the country of people just going and turning in a frothing dogs at the prospect of have you wear a mask, and a lot of people say they don't understand it, and they want to say it's just buse people are stupid, but I think it's something much more understandable in a weird way, it's that, so obviously we all know that there's of the politicized Americans, which is once again less than like half of the American population. even has like political instincts, thinks politically, draws political inferences from things that means something, I mean have invested themselves in politics as it's understood in America, I e the electoral system. I'm not talking about people being alienated, everybody's alienated, but they have a vocabulary for it, and they have a world view that that uh that explains it, and I'm saying that I if you want to broadly draw 50% of the population, people who vote as those who are most likely to frame their anger, their disappointments and their goals around political ideas, they don't live in the same world, right? we live in different epistemic realities with different value systems and it's totally zero sum, something is either either triggers the libs or triggers the cons, and if it's does the one thing uh, if it triggers the ones you don't like, then you it's good, it's just a pure negative dialectic of of uh of agitation, and you could wonder like, how do people live in a country? with people that they are that violently opposed to without it getting more violent than it does, and part of the big reason is it sublimat, the hostility is sublimated by the the spect, observing the spectacle of politics, getting in getting excited when our guy owns the other guy, getting excited when there's a successful troll done uh or someone wins an election of course, that's the big game, so they get that level of... nation uh, but part of the big reason is that they are able to carve out a world where they are not direct. being they are not directly defeated because that's what everyone is terrified everyone hates the idea being of losing to these people in some sort of meaningful like significant way like elections are just proxies elections are just entertainment and then you invest emotions and then when there's a good result you're happy and there's a bad result you're sad that's the main emotional lev that's the main emotional uh trigger of elections that's what they're there for the it's there to be the big to get excited about and then to get really sad or really happy, either way, it's draining your political oregon into the into the spectacle, which is what is that what it's there for, but it's all, it's all spectacle because life at America is largely the same no matter who's in charge, i mean the economy gets worse and bad depending on how close we are to the popping of whatever bubble we're in, and there's wars all the time and there's occasional school shootings and things and individual people can't get like horribly traumatized uh if they're not lucky, but for the most part there's sort of a steady state American experience and the declines are gradual enough that they are not, they are not processed as emergencies and so people sort of feel like those damn liberals or those damn conservatives, they are doing things that are bad and i hate them and they're making the country bad and they're why the country is bad, but they have not the day of defeat has not come. you know like the on the right, the gun people, the guys are obsessed with the second American revolution and defending themselves, ev Obama was there for eight years, they complained the whole time, but at no point did any of them get there, get to where they say this is it, you know, or very few of them anyway, they were the whole eight years, they were just like come and get it, and it never really happened, so they never, they never rose up, uh, and same thing happens uh, and I think if Biden got in there, he'd have similar thing, but the masks are different. because the mask, making someone wear a mask in public through social abrorium and the legal code, that is compelling behavior, that is compelling actual behavior, it's not choosing to throw your kirig out the window because they were mean to Shawn Hannity or buying a uh trunk load of goya beans to give yourself diarrhea for a month. This is actual your life, and because the masks are part of that epistemic tree of the enemies, that propaganda fake news universe where liberals live, you know, the mainstream media is part of that, the Democratic party, some Republicans and uh, and of course, anything like the medical establishment, just like the scientists who say global warming is real, if they make you maar a mask, you have to put a mask on your face in public, that is a public, it's a it might as well say cuck, you've lost, it's some fundamental way, some real conflict happened, the one you've been waiting for, the one you've been girding your loins for, and and especially one that you thought you were winning until five minutes ago, you guys were winning up until fucking Trump, up until February, it looked like Trump was going to get a second term, it was going to be more epic dabbing on the liberals until the end of time until your heart explodes. and now like that, the Chinese and the media and the democrats can make up some bullshit fucking virus, make up a whole bunch of uh of of stuff to make you to to get you scared, to make you vote for a democrat, to destroy the economy so it hurts Trump, and then the worst of all to normalize this surrender, this physical manifestation of your... defeat at the hands of liberalism, no wonder people lose their shit, it's like imagine if Trump made you wear a mask for like an American flag mask for like America day that he declared, everyone ask to wear a mask or they go to jail, how many people would get insanely pissed, how many people would get viral getting like tazed or fighting someone over not wearing the mask, and of course you say, but there's a difference, that would just be arbitrary uh flexing of his. power, whereas this is a response to a real uh uh viral phenomenon and and and public health hazard to which I say, not to them, they don't see the difference, it's all political, it's all just a battle of domination, there is no objective realm, and if you have to wear, if you wear a mask that means so i see why they get so fucking pissed, i really think they're pissed, i think for that reason and that's why. uh, there's no real possibility that we're ever going to tackle any emerging threat, any crisis by coming together, the fantasy, you know, like that's the Biden campaign, as he's saying, hey, we're all going to come together, that's why republicans listen to them, they love me too, and you know what, given the situation, a economic collapse and a viral pandemic that a lot of people blamed him for, because he was the president, and that's generally how works, the president gets the blame for shit like unemployment and gas prices, of course they're going to get the blame for a fucking viral pandemic, that's just the nature of the office, it it it shit uh, it it's the lightning rod for everything, they get blamed and credited for things that they don't really have anything to do with, now of course in his case he does have a lot to do with it because he did have a manifestly incompetent reaction, but he wasn't the only one and plenty of democrat uh democrats in high office like Andrew Como and gaven Newson stepped on their dick plenty enough for everyone. but it's looking uh, it's looking bad for the Trumpy, it's not looking good for him, and you know if you're conservative, it's just because they pressed the fucking media pressed some buttons, I'm gonna let you guys in on a secret, uh, people are going asking me about the the last chapel episode, uh, I guess I just want to get this out of the way so I don't have to deal with it um I mean I know some people are joking but uh with the cognitive test thing I was doing a bit where I was pretending to not be able to get the answers right because I thought it'd be funnier than everyone getting them easily correct because it was obviously a very easy uh test so uh just putting it out there I am not cognitively declining any more than anyone of my age. which is significantly because after you hit 25 your neuroelasticity basically goes to shit, so it's not like I'm not cognitively declining, it's just that it's more, it's slower and it's earlier than the process. I could definitely draw a clock, I don't have any paper here, but I could definitely draw a clot. but Biden is trying to do the thing that is impossible, which is bring everyone together, because there is no everyone and there is no together, there is no unified - system with undergirding social uh foundations uh or even shared reality so I think that even though as I was saying Trump looks like he's fucked and people think it's so his people think it's because of democratic shinanigans but it's just the absolute happen stance of of the the coronavirus thing more than anything uh which you know I don't think any president would have done a great job with, including Hillary, would have done better than him, probably, but people wouldn't have known how bad he would do, so they would blame them, they they would be mad as mad at whoever the president was as they are at Trump, because they wouldn't know that Trump would have been worse, or they couldn't know that, you know what I mean, they don't live in that reality, they live in the reality where their person fucked things up, but so he's going to get blamed for something that at that is relatively random uh, and that's going to lead to he may be losing an actual. like landslide, although I don't think that that's inevitable at all, and I think the democrats going crazy for it, are just getting too hepped up, they're getting too riled, oh he's going to win Georgia and he's going to win Arizona, he's going to win Texas, slow down, he'll be lucky to win Florida, but there's a chance that he wins significantly and handdily, and with republican support, and that will give people this this little notion, I guarantee you, if he wins significantly, you will see a... across the land, the media saying, this is it, we have broken the Trump fever, and we have unified the country. now they won't be able to delude themselves into saying that the republican party is somehow purged of of its uh, irrationality, they will just say the republican party is now a rump, composed of just like the most backward members of society, and that now we will move forward in a spirit of true bipartisan unity to defeat corona and global warming. and everything, everyone else, i'm just going to do the spoiler alert right now, that will not happen, there is no, there's no common response to the crises of the moment. but there is only the struggle for power over the uh the institutions and the uh and of course those means of production. What does this phrase socialism or barbarism mean? It's uh, it's the inevitable crisis point provoked by uh, by the capitalist consumption of the natural world. where there's a crisis of production and surpluss and and output and all that stuff just gets all those gears and then there's two choices, there's we socialize the means of production, create an efficient distribution according to need rather than desires cooked up by capitalism itself, which reduces the horrifying toll on the environment and and allows for more of... a homeostatic relationship with the natural world, and that means value for all human life and all life, to some extent, much more so than now, uh, but if the other the other road in that crisis moment, and we're looks like we're in, I mean, we're always in a crisis, but this is getting, this is getting extra crisisy, although I must stipulate that that late capitalism, as we call it could could could limp on for decades, fuck, maybe a hundred years depending on how to technology shakes out uh and of course not in, there will be countries falling apart over that time and there will be massive violence, but it will be assimilated and normalized into a system that might have to drop off parts, that are no longer governed, but will hold even tighter to those areas where it has control, and that that's a realm where the the the selfish pursuit of resources by all these damn rational actors leads to the... being uh inevitably fatally uh unbalanced and leading every human being to only be able to violently compete with each other for what's left through uh through war, exploitation, slavery, whatever, whatever, whatever tool is necessary to grasp the last... the last bits, last the last remaining arabal land and mineral, rare earth minerals and profit, however it could be expressed, so that's your socialism and your barbarism, and there is no third way, because capitalism drive is towards oblivion and towards uh, towards critical overconsumption, which means any hybrid system that's still engine driven by. capitalism especially in a fractured uh uh nation state riddled world like the one we have will lead towards fatal competition and destruction so you got to have you have to have you got to pull that engine out of the machine you have to pull the profit motive out of the the the machinery of of human uh economics it's the only way to prevent that that that decline into barbarism, and of course it won't even get called barbarism, if if technology is able to be maintained, it will be called humanity, it will be called liberalism, it will be called uh uh enlightenment, mass uh, mass euthanasia and and eugenics and engineered viruses, you have to like pay a monthly subscription not to die from. Who would be able to look at that and say, oh, this is the savagery of of Tamerline, no, this is, this is humanity, this is us, this is us dealing forthrightly and adultly with the crises and problems that the world faces us, faces gives us. I ran out a bloody scuse in me skills wall it oh i got to talk to my member of parliament me skills wall it's blady empty man im skint i don't got any skills mate i spent me less skill at the tesco. awful, terrible, i should never do that, i didn't watch the 30 rock special and now i'm worried i won't be able to, i don't know if it's gonna be available, it wasn't on hulu, i mean i know it's depressing and terrible and a fucking ad for awful shows on a streaming set network, a streaming series for a network, which is now all of them, they all have that, what the heck, who are the ad wizards who came up? was this one, am i right? i've got a skills wallet, i' got a skills wallet, don't i live dem's proposed new skills wallet scheme, no, i mean the the skills wallet is a terrible phrase and it's obviously per'. neoliberal uh you know uh social engineering oh yes we give people money but only if they spend it on education and only between the years of 30 and 39 just oh my god come on guys get it give it give it up you weirdos you're sick you're siccos you love that shit but it's also premise on the false idea that labor market shortfalls are caused by some sort of uh skills mismatch which was pretty definitively disproven by the recovery uh from the uh uh from 2008, i love, i mean my favorite thing ever was the learn to code thing, people talk about keisic was one of those guys who got absolutely fixated on the coding thing, like he drived through the the appellation parts of uh eastern Ohio or youngstown and just think if all these guys could code, and now one of these people thinks, well if everyone could code then how much would you get for being able to code? how much can you get for knowing how to read? you there's... no, there's no income premium, if it's universal, and they just can't conceive of that, because otherwise there's no answer, buse these guys, there's a reason that liberals fixate on education, whatever that means is cuuse it's the only way out of the out of the maze that they've built for themselves, the intellectual maze of like defending a patently indefensible institution that reinforces the grosses kind of social inequality and racial inequality and gender segregation and exploitation, how the hell do you stand that legit? and the answer is, well, if we could just get people smarter, they all just went to college, there, there's no rest of that sentence when it comes to, to the economy, right, because there can't be, like I said, it's it's incoherent, but uh, but it's the other end of it, it's the social end that they really think that they really think there's something there, they think if everyone went to college they be, they would all be enlightened and that would make the world better. Not if they, I mean we're seeing it now, how much is how much is college helping anybody be better people when it gets them no job and uh six figure debt? Overproduction of elites, yeah, you're actually making the people you can't get into the uh the high status jobs more miserable than they would have been by raising their fucking expectations, you raise the generation of people's expectations. what they were going to get out of life and what they could be settle and most importantly what they would settle for, and now they're really pissed, that reminds me of uh of how it come it came up in the context of uh of after uh Michael Brooks is passing there was some awful person and I'm not even going to name who decided to use it as an opportunity to like try to yell at Felix for some reason and it just and he kept calling him a grifter and that just struck me because that is the word of words to describe people on the left it's like every everyone is on the lookout for for a grifter if you're if you're not if you're not explicitly ideologically evil like a nazi or something you then you're then the second bad faith assumption is grifter and it's pretty clear at this point that the word has lost any kind of meaning cuz ostensibly it's supposed to be about somebody who who gets money from people under false pretenses right and kind of by definition. something like a podcast where you pay for episodes or something, cannot be a grift, unless those episodes don't exist, unless you download the episodes and then they aren't there, if they if you if you're paying for something somebody is offering you, and you get what they what they what they advertised, then by no definition can a grift have occurred, and yet it's all these people, all of whom have podcasts accusing each other being grifters when the the term doesn't even obtain, and i think it's because they're trying to get a deeper accusation, which is that you're not serious. it's either that you're not serious about what you what you claim to believe and you're just doing it for clout and therefore money and therefore that's a grift, or you're a fraud and you don't know what you're talking about, and that there they're and uh, and that is what makes it a scam because even though you are giving people what they asked for and what they're paying for, you're doing it under false pretenses of who you are. and of course it should be pretty clear why that's an absurd and incoherent way to try to argue and like make sense of the world around you, because it requires you to know uh someone's like internal motivation for why they say things rather than what they're actually saying and I mean it's you just dug a hole for yourself if your interest is actually you know moving forward with now. which of course isn't the point, it's just to exercise people and build lot barriers, it's just one more, one more brick in the wall, but I think the real underlying part of it all is what I said a few episodes, a few stritch streams ago about how the lack of faith in the project is like the undergrding uh uh uh flaw in the left if it exists is that most people are... really operating under any belief that anything they do will do any good uh and I think that that Grifter accusation is an attempt to sniff out the people for whom that's true be like this person is just mouthing these things and that they're really just here for the scene and the verso loft and all that and I think once again the the tragedy there is that the reason that's so resonant and so frequently uh used as an epithet is because it applies to some degree about all to all of us, and it's yeah, it's like it's it's it's the fixation on that is just a neurotic inability of people to deal with it in themselves and so they have to uh condemn it strenuously in others and make sure everyone knows that they don't s from it, that's because they're not secure in their own beliefs and they have not grounded them, they haven't fixed them, they haven't accepted that, you know what, it probably won't get better, probably not going to see anything good come of any of my actions, but it's still worth doing regardless, it's still in fact morally required of me to do these things, because it springs from my like my spiritual understanding of my place in the world, rather than as a as a way to uh, distract ourselves from from our powerlessness, i would like to do lamb skewers, someone is suggesting lamb skewers on the grill, i will do that, i think maybe i'll do that next time, get maybe make them homemade siki sauce. put some petas on there, yeah, I'm thinking that sounds pretty good, I think I'm going to do that. uh someone's asking about the federal troops, I don't think he's going to do it, uh, I think he's stove, he's he has found something that he thinks is going to win for him, because obviously Trump only has one button to push, it's the same one he pushed in 2016, and of course that's insane because he's been president now for four years, so it's not nearly as effective, but the one button he has is that cultural uh polarization button, and we actually already have a re a decent uh suggestion that it might not work if he's in power because people, I mean obviously it feels like a million years ago, but in 2018 during the mid-term, remember he put all those troops at the Mexican border and whipped up of terror about the caravans, those troops are still there by the way, uh, waiting for a caravan that never shows up, uh, and he still lost, pretty badly, so nationalizing the election around those like galvanizing social issues didn't work at least once, I mean, the context of 2016 is really so much more about Hillary Clinton uh, than about him and about what she represented and crew. what he represented, which was an alternative, he's not an alternative anymore, i think a lot of people kind of underestimate that, he's no longer, nobody could vote to him being like, hey, what's the worst going to happen? they now know what they get when they get him, and a lot of them don't like it, and there's nobody who's going to do like the hey, throw the dice thing, because they know what they get with him, that's why undecideds and less engaged people tend to in elections with an incument, at the last they tend to uh break against them. at least that's always true, but it tends to be true for that reason uh, so this time I think he thinks, oh great, the statue shit is my thing now, this is the one thing that he can pull out of the muck that could be a polarizing issue because he tried it with the with the masks and with the go outside order, which is now being totally underwhelmed, overwhelmed by the inevitable, you know spread of the disease beyond cont or hope of containment and uh he's already backtrack like he's wearing masks now he can't really he can't really press that button uh and then like he can't really do the uh the the black lies matter thing that he was doing earlier like you know where he was saying black lives matter was hate slogan and stuff like that that's not polling well because broadly speaking the the goals of the of the protests have been met with approval in uh in polling now what that means I have no idea, I don't think it necessarily means anything, but uh, it certainly doesn't give him a sense that this is a fertile row to ho uh, but the idea of like untramled violence in the in the cities and him being the only one who can stop it because the local democrats are too feckless, uh, that's some fucking, you know, that's some old fashioned uh, Bernie gets ass 80's New York shit, which is his wheel house. so he's going to keep trying to uh escalate this, like this is all intentionally uh uh uh, this is all intentionally provocative, i mean it seemed as though the protests were sort of not peetering out, but losing their front page urgency because they had become less and less con uh violent because the cops for the most part in most places had stood down a little bit, and therefore the the the marches went by largely unmolested, they didn't escalate, and so they became assimilated into the day-to-day reality and we're no longer news and then the fucking plane cl or the uh unmarked cars start plucking people off the streets of Portland, which is of course you know one of the most fervent cities for uh uh protest and uh and one of the most like organized and uh uh uh confrontational lefts left protest scene in the country uh and what do you know it that sparks off a whole new round of conflict? I mean, people talk about how this is, this is a dress rehearsal for fascism, and mean yeah, as if the crisis persists and gets worse and we don't do any redistribution, yeah, pulling people off the street and on mark cars is going to give much more common, but in the more near term, and I think more in what Trump is thinking, uh, heightens the conflict that he thinks he can win up, but the problem is I don't think he can, because because he's the incumbent, and because he is so intentionally inflammatory in his speech and in his actions, he I think will get blamed more than certainly biden by people who are disturbed, or people who aren't already committed and who are disturred by you know protest violence, because you now in 68 nixon ran as a as a peacemaker, a guy was going to stop all the violence and all the mania in the streets, uh, but that's cuuse you, he wasn't in office, uh, Trump is in office, how do you say vote for me and all this will stop when it's happening under you? i mean, you aren't stopping it now, why would i think you're going to stop it a year from now? biden on the other hand, he says he might, so i think this is all part of his his one campaign strategy and I think that that's going to be the next four months is going to be him uh especially especially uh verbally. and in tweets raising the stakes against the mob and tifa and all that shit and people are going to respond and there's going to be more protest, there's going to be, I mean the libs are going to lose their shit because it's going to look more and more like he's he's threatening, he's like going to promise an actual civil war in America's streets, but I think that he doesn't have the sand for the actual confrontation, uh, look what happened. with the lafayet square uh clearing, he went out there, waved the bible around and then the next that day threatened to send the army to American cities, at which point joint chief started leaking like a siv that they wouldn't take those orders and the whole thing was shelved. now right now, now he's doing it through DHS cuuse that's a compliant tody and those guys are his guys in a way that the army still isn't, but their dha give me a fucking break, they're a bunch of fucking they're the losers, they're they're the they're the they're the runoffs, they're they're um, they're not those guys, the bureau of prisons i think is is not the same department, but uh the guys that we talked about a few weeks ago who just destroyed all of their uh coworkers with paintballs and uh and flashbangs they brought from home during a simulated exercise. So yeah, I think there's gonna be more stuff in Portland, I think he might send some guys in to try to provoke in the big cities, but I think whenever the the the real moment of like confrontation comes, I think he'll back down. Oh man, Jacob, the man is simply a king, there's no denying it, he is one of the most brilliant post modern media figures of the moment, he's one of the very few who I admire, because he's free, none of us are free, none of these, none of the people in this like whatever the hell you want to call it uh uh uh this moras of uh of internet political personalities. people who essentially monetize their identities as like vectors of political agitation uh all of us are bound by to some invisible audience, some imagined viewer or reader who we want to respect us, we imagine who they are, they're basically us, because we imagine like somebody, if i was out there would i like me that kind of thing, jacob wall has bliter. that he doesn't care what anyone thinks of it uh, which is astounding, and and what better example of that than him making up a fake LLC to pay himself uh, that is one letter off from the one that jusley Maxwell has and then claiming that he she paid him to do dirty tricks, bragging about it, essentially braging about a fake dirty tricks campaign that he was going that he carried out on behalf evil person and he's out there clout chasing it, I mean it beggers imagination, in a world where we've all decided to like plug into a global penopticon where at every moment our psyches are totally vulnerable to being... devastated by the just acquisitory unblinking eye of our perceived audience that even exists when we're not online or posting, this guy is gliding, he's walking between the raindrops, he's vibing at a frequency that not even dogs could hear, yeah, like he is the guy who more than anyone and especially anybody who claims that's the case, he has embraced the idea that there is no such thing as bad publicity, like a lot of those uh out right guys will kind of uh point to the fact that they do open racism, which makes means that they can't monetize the way that uh left-wing or non-explicitly racist political people can, as proof that they're authentic and genuine, right? and that is one of the big reasons that I think a lot of young white men go to the outright is because the the simulated alienating hell of online makes us crave authenticity. which of course is itself a fantasy and and a chimera, but it's still something that is a load star for many of us, and when you see everything being sold to you with people selling themselves all throughout the internet, if somebody could point to something and say: like, I mean this, I'm not full of shit, if they can actually point to something, some part of their belief system that that validates that argument, it's very, to some people it's very engaging, and I think for a lot of those all right guys, uh, they they say, I'm the real shit, I'm the real danger, because I'm literally not allowed on YouTube, and I think people see that and they think, oh shit, yeah, that's authentic, that's authentic, uh, and of course it doesn't really. mean anything, you know, it's it's just really a question of eticat, like where where what capitalist etiquet is and how it impacts uh it's you know uh market structures, essentially just the rules of the market of behavior of the market have changed uh and and now you're just you're as much like those guys are as much a threat to capitalism as somebody jacking off in a bank lobby you know it's like it's gross and at some point the cops are going to show up and and get him out of there but he's not going to fucking bring the that bank to its knees by jacking off in the lobby, and that's what those guys are, they're jacking off in the lobby of like the the the marketized realm that we all live in the internet, and they're calling the fact that they're asked to leave, proof that they're dangerous and really subversive, but it is a mark of authenticity, it's a mark at the very least that they're not after what they think those other people are after, they're not after money, they're not after fame, they're not after getting their butts smooched by hollywood pedophiles, and that is persuasive, but the thing is those guys still are just as terrified of their perceived audience, i mean remember the thing with Pinovic and his Jewish wife where he like left his Jewish wife because his mouth drieving dipshit fans found out about it, that is not a free man, i don't care if he has to post under a suidonim or whatever and he has to like go to the dark web to get paid for his fucking podcast, that is a man who has been brutally cucked by his own audience, jacob wall doesn't care. Jacob does not care at all. i could write a poem with that title. uh, and he expresses that by humiliating himself in a way that no one would do, uh, that no one could do unintentionally. that's what's so brilliant about it. like the the specific, there are obviously a lot of clowns and pathetic losers out there, like you know, uh, uh, guys who like pick their nose and eat it on a stream, you know, it's it's not hard to find. lot of self-administered ls out there, but they're usually uh, they speak to that person's incompetence or or just personal loadsomness or lack of social skills, walls humiliations could only be intentionally self-inflicted, and the thing is is that they also inflict damage at a very like low level, but they inflict damage on his supposed worldview too, none of you, not not only do not of his uh smears on democrats land, the very fact that he's doing them and the fact that he's associated in some way with conservativism undermines conservativism to a little to a little extent, but he doesn't give a shit cuz he doesn't really care about politics in my opinion, i think he grew up in a millieu of politics because of his insane father, but i feel like he is totally dettached probably because he saw the sausage getting made from a young age from any conceptions of political value system. he just assimilated the the self-dealing that's behind it all, the the gimmick, the the the the the the fraud at the heart of modern politics and certainly modern consumer, conservativism, you know, going back to Richard Vigory in the direct mail uh uh the direct mail uh lists that started the conservative movement in the 50s and 60s, it's all been a fucking giant scam, it's all mid-level marketing, it's all handed in each other's pockets, all to advance personally within this... system of of mutual exploitation, cannibals all, and wall got that at some point, i think and just took it to the next level, like, okay, this is, this is this, the game name of the game is personal, personal advancement through political spectacle, well, anyway i do that, i'm going to be trapped in the mall of this machinery, how could I possibly indulge this while still being in any way a free human being, and he figured it out. by just detaching completely from human conceptions. now of course the question then becomes who's paying for it? and that is why we have to always get back to the material basis for all analysis, because obviously the fact that wall is so obv manifestly incompetent limits the number of people who are reasonably likely to give him money, you know, i i can't imagine that he he has a lot of real clients. I mean he does have a history of doing literal uh stock fraud allegedly which he's that's why he's banned from like trading stocks on uh and I think he's he's still waiting trial on on securities. out in California, that was when he was a teenager, so he he is now, so could this whole thing be a money laundering operation for someone else, which describes most of the economy at this point, uh, I mean, the uh, the liquidity in the global market is provided by the laundering of illegal black market money, uh, there is some persuasive evidence that the... 2008 collapse was prevented from being a absolute uh dismantling of the global economy by the presence of a huge amount of liquid capital in the form of laundered uh drug money that basically helped fill the gap but before uh the government was able to loosen the flood gates, but it's all just it's all fucking bad money being turned into good money that's Trump's job, that's uh, fuck, that's silicon valley, all that shit, uh, that's the fucking real estate market, that's all money laundering, investment, I'm sorry, investment, quantitative easing, um, so maybe he's part of that, I don't know, but when he got an only fans, that was amazing, mind blowing, he decided to go on, he's like 24 years old and on steroids to get all weird and ropey and like broad as shit and like, i don't know, he is a riddle, he is a riddle wrapped in enigma, and it's i would and i and if i knew where the money was coming from that would help solve the equation, i think uh, if he's got family money then he's basically just a hobbiist, a very talented hobbist but a hobbiist, if he's somehow making money off of this then he is one of the greatest geniuses of all time. if he is actually making money at what he says he's doing then he is the greatest genes of all time and honestly even if he is money laundering for somebody that's still pretty impressive unemployment expension McConnell came out today and said they're going to do it it's probably going to be the last check, but I never, I honestly say, I never really thought for a second uh, that they weren't going to do that, because we are just so far away from not from allowing from not allowing a second, or not requiring rather, a second uh check dispersal, that at a certain point politic ideology has to give way to political reality, as much as these guys were apparently enamored of the idea that oh no we can't give people money. then they won't go to work and then the unemployment rate will go up as if that matters compared to the like a third of the people in the country being evicted from their homes uh so yeah i figured they were going to blink it's going to be bad and it's going to be more you know more money up of course always more money for the top so that when they could swoop in and just buy up all the old real estate of all the small businesses and further monopolize the economy. but uh I think they're going to do another check and I think they're going to do unemployment extension too uh also maybe a cap maybe uh a capital gains tax cut which would be hilarious and also a uh fucking what a payroll tax cut amazing they can't help it it really is built into the system to like to to do anything else like we could say well why would you just do x y or z to do those things they would have to be different. people and like a fundamental way, you know, if they just did a payroll tax cut that would be amazing, but I don't think they'd do it, at a certain point there has to be a recognition of real self-interest. I mean that's the thing you have to remember though is that you know when you're trying to figure out what capital is going to do, you do it from the assumption of they're operating out of what they consider the best interest of capital broadly defined is, if you're talking about government as sort of the as the stand-in for uh for a like a round table of large capitalists um there can only operate from their best perception of their their best interest, and every government and despot that's ever been overthrown in a revolution, uh, at every... point they thought what they were doing was in their best interest, and at a certain point they were no longer correct, because ideology starts gumming the works, you reproduce the most mediocre minded dipshits to fill every meaningful position, you get completely detached from the actual micro reality that uh that hayak claims is supposed to like uh signal what's really happening at the grassroots to to the top levels of government. All right guys, I'm gonna get off in a minute here, a few more questions and I'm gonna gonna say buy-bye. How much longer will twitter be a website? That's a good question. It certainly lasts longer than I would have thought it would when it started. It's weird. how after early innovations, it really just and things popping up and going down and frendstered and smack spaces, it really just settled in the facebook and twitter, there's never been like a a third heat, unless you on instagram, which is different i think, maybe tiktok is going to replace all of it, i mean if you if if the tweens are you know hegemonic and they keep move marching through like the income brackets assuming that... still are any associated with more you know spending income and more influence on the on markets and advertising, maybe maybe it all becomes tik tok, if they if they got rid of tik tock, wouldn't there be an American version of tiktok immediately to pop up? why the hell did, i don't understand the internet, i should stop talking about it. It's just a bunch of clicks and whistles to me. I kind of assume all of it will be the same but different until you don't notice. Yeah, I was just thinking about vine. What the hell happened to vine? was it because it was seven seconds and tik toks are are longer or was it the cuuse i remember when the tiktok started it was all because they had music, it was just people lip sinking and then it turned into a bunch of other craziness, at first it was people lip sinking, was it just they had access to music? i don't understand it, i don't understand and it yeah let's go to web 1.0 guys i was there ate my balls i kiss you uh mrt through hell of a far Shawnbaby.com mr cranky uh the dancing hamster that was a hell of an internet just clicking along on a dial up modem, the forum era, people can always ask me if i was ever on something awful and i never was, i didn't even know what it was until many years later, i didn't meet i met all those guys who are legends on something awful through twitter, i never went on something awful, i was on mr cranky, it was a movie review website, that was my shit, uh, sadly i don't think any of those uh, uh those for those rooms survive, which frankly good, they would suck and i'm i would never want to read them, but yeah uh that's how i'll end things with let's... we need to we need to like recognize limits while still recognizing people's curiosity and need to explore new forms, so my compromise is we don't ban the internet, that's crazy, we just go to web 1.0 and then you have to be happy with that, it builds character, it builds character if that's all you get, all you get our angel fires with little clickers on the bottom saying how uh which visitor you are, bye-bye.
