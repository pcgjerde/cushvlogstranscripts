 Hi guys, I'm uh looking betific today, but I'm sitting in the sun because now that it's cursed, blessed late September, it's actually... uh not warm enough for this to bug me, usually the sun directly on my precious skin gets bothers due to my large sweaty nature, so instead uh today i can get the sun on me and and i get to affect that aw awesome betific uh catholic saint look that uh is always very persuasive i find when when trying to get ideas across, i do like fall more than summer, of course i do, come on fall is the best season. It's not an argument to be had about this, yeah, I think what we're going to be doing with these, is we're going to be, some days I'm going to be out here, and then the days when uh, Chris and I are working at the office on other uh secret projects will also stream from there too, yeah, no, if you're a big gentleman such as myself, falls when you stop sweating so much, and that itself is a reason to be blessed. Well if I h rooms now I probably wouldn't even get anything before we before the I wouldn't even get anywhere before I had to log off winter people. Yeah, I respect it, it's a strong move, but I can't share it. I mean, I like it, I like it more than summer for the most part, although I don't think it's going to be as good, I think with covid, winter is going to be pretty brutal if you don't if you live anywhere above the snow line, although maybe we don't have a snowline anymore, so maybe that's a little like bad news, uh, global pandemic makes it so that you can't go uh outside when it's really cold and you can't stay inside uh with other people, good news, there's no more cold so you can stay out. all year round, even in the north, problem that's fixed itself, i will say i will admit, someone's asking if i've ever been to a mikelwe happy hour, i did one time, very early when i moved to new york and i was like, wow, i'm now around all of these, these like people i only know from the internet, wow, this is crazy after being in you know the hinterland uh, and i went to one of those happy hours and it helped disabused me of the notion that there was any... real anything going on here other than uh resume padding and uh and clout chasing someone's grill someone's drilling in the back person someone's drilling not me i'm not grilling either watch the social dilemma and i thought that it actually had some really insightful stuff at the beginning talking about the mechanisms that social media operates by like the the cuz you know we talked about how uh talked about how like advertising doesn't work in the traditional sense you know like they don't really know what they're getting for their money there's no quantitative way to assess the influence that advertising has even uh like big data and uh targeted ad advertising, but the movie makes a good point that you know it's not so much even about discrete behavior as it is just about like setting a cultural context for people that essentially shapes them slowly and steadily without their knowledge, not even through purchases, but through attitudes that then later on or express though purchases and i think that's true, but the rest of it was just jaw dropping, i mean it's made apparently by a bunch of silicon valley people, including the ones who did all this shit and now feel bad about it, which is very funny uh, but their attitude is is and even a few of them will explicitly say, yeah, there's an uh, this stuff is all programmed to make money, which means it gives doesn't give a shit what it does to the social fabric or our ability to process reality, but in the second half, the prescriptive half, it all comes down to uh, you know, regulating these industies, as though there is a way that they can make money that does not operate by these premises, like that's the whole point of this moment in time is that we operate on this idea that we are in a uh political and economic moment that could like in the 50s see a some sort of humane. capitalism, some sort of moment where the worst excesses of capitalism are recognized by the people carry them out and are reined in, but that like a lot of our things in politics, it stems from a delusion that that the stuff that obtained back then can obtain now, because i'm sorry, the political economy is different, we are not the the productive hub of the world anymore, the entire economy we have is based on. relative financialization of all elements of life, and the the effect of social media on people turning us into pure hamsters, pure anxiety hamsters of of of terror and need, and they are the only ones that can fulfill them, that's a huge part of it, i mean that's like first you do that to people's consumption and then you do it to their employment, which is the gig economy, which is not really talked about in this movie, but is an extension into meet space of the the'. experience online and it can't survive without these things, the profit is not there, the pie is not big enough, profit has to be abolished as the undergrding algorithm. another good point the film makes is that AI is not about computers becoming sensient and having a separate point of view than mankind, creating a separate and conflicting with mankind in some like self-conscious way point of view like: oh these humans, we need to suppress them because they're not doing x, y or z. no, ai will simply be the moment or uh the ai is simply the fully the full conversion of the entire uh like digital essentially creating a brain turning turning uh turning like the web turning the internet into a an actual. brain that is, but that brain is not its own, that brain has already got the algorithm loaded into it, and it's profit extraction, and like the singularity is simply the moment when human inputs into that mechanism, at the top are no longer necessary and itself perpetuating, i mean to an extent, all humans are replaceable in capitalism, which is why talking about the individual greed of individual capitalist is so pointless, if they are replaced or if they have a change of heart, i mean if they have a change of heart, either because they're scared of the people or because like for their own lives or because uh they like see they have a grinch like expansion of the size of their heart over time they will either be replaced from within by people who will do the job necessary or uh the firm will be defeated uh the firm will fail the firm will be over absorbed and then that person will lose their authority so people are already largely replaceable in capitalism and have been replaced by algorithmic thinking uh but but there is, but but the singularity and and artificial intelligence, the real threat there is that's the moment when the algorithm is self-replicating through technology and through the internet and doesn't even need us anymore, and then the only question is, and then essentially what happens is is that the people at the top just get to sit, they they don't even have to do any work, the work is done completely for them, but they still get the profits, because remember there is nothing in the algorith. of capitalism expressed through machine logic uh that would redirect that flow of of profit to what the computer? the computer doesn't want the things humans want, the computer doesn't have that hole inside of them that humans have, and it even did, it sure as hell couldn't fill fill it with with uh, what yaughts and fucking gold toilets and dale ernhart memorabiliia and beautiful boats, they're fucking robots. but yeah the second half of it really reminds you oh yeah these silicon valley people they really don't know what's going on because they're too narrowly focused on on on the the the the technical aspects that they don't understand the overarching role that they're playing. "the only way that the computers would take over then at that point would be if they developed like existential anxiety and then tried to help tried to solve it through a like sensual uh indulgence and then they would become the new ruling class, but for the mass of humanity the relationship wouldn't change, you just have robots uh in the what, robots in the in the gated communities in in in the hanging around in swimming pools, i mean they would have to i guess get their own thing of what they would want to do with the capital, they would have to have their own idea of what they wanted to do with the capital to like. fill their hole that whatever robots like, but that's just it, they don't like anything, you can't just turn this shit on and off, we're the process, we are the product, we're the we're the middle point or maybe the end point, who knows of a of a developmental process of human consciousness, it happens within an individual, but then with through a whole a whole species, and i guess the computers could do it faster, you know because they could do everything faster, but i don't, i don't know enough about computer science. my main i r the whole worry about AI is just a lot of it seems like uh backdoor bragging dang we made these computers too good we made these robots too good fuck like when ilon mus talks about it it's because he thinks he's he's dr frankenstein and he's not he's a fucking medicine show peddler with some like uh snake venom and cowpiss based uh unguent that's supposed to cure all ailments. Yeah, there is a black, I hate the plug black mirror because it's a little on the nose, but there's a black mirror episode where a robot uh, a robot guard dog meant to protect a warehouse of goods uh, is unleashed on people. full scaveging and and chases them down and kills them uh and the thing that's wrong with that episode in my opinion is at one point you see uh oh wait a minute no you don't apparently there was originally supposed to be a scene with like the drone operator who's like eating a sandwich and then you know uh coordinating the actions like like trying to evoke the the removed moral calculus of uh of drone operators but i think it's more harrowing and more accurate as like an analysis of the likelihood trajectory of things, if there is nobody left to command the robots, if if if everything collapses and even the ruling class is destroyed, maybe not all of them in person, but their ability to like assert social control, but like the remnant uh algorithm driven machinery of the system continues operating on its own accord, and so even the people left are unable to like remake the world because you've got these machines patrolling obsolete uh uh property lines, what if the computer was your best friend? what if what if your mobile was also your girlfriend? Uh, yeah, no, that was very good, that was a very good Felix Riff. Ooh, my favorite Mr. Show sketches uh, I think just for personal enjoyment, I don't think it's the funniest, but it's the for me most personally enjoyment is uh, is crime stoppers with uh or with crime stoppers with JJ with FF Woody Cooks, where Bob Otenkirk plays the guy in the in the barber shop quartet outfit with the giant mustache, he tells us worry about the eneft criminals being thorted by the crying security guard who you know twist shares a name me uh and one of the reasons i really love that is not just the great performance by Odenkirk but is that uh growing up in the midwest I watched on um Syndicated TV the same Chicago area syndicated crime show that clearly the Odenkirks had watched or somebody from the Chicago had watched. uh called tough target with a guy named JJ Bittenbinder who was a real guy and he dressed like that and he had that mustache and he would tell stories of like uh of crimes and give tips on how to thort criminals trying to attack you, and when i saw that sketch the first time as a kid, i just was like, oh my god, they're doing a fucking f a jj bitten binder car parody on HBO, and i was street smarts, that's it, with ff woody cooks, you tore the plan into two pieces, bad and worse, you said a crime stick, those two are a couple of dinggings. uh and apparently I remember I watched the of course I've watched the the uh uh all of the DVD commentaries which RIP DVD commentaries that's a genre that's one of the shortest lived genres of entertainment media you I can imagine buse how long did we have those as a thing DVD commentaries that they would be like recorded and actually listened to 10 years maybe less man like laser discs had a better run but anyway. uh, so of course I listened to the DVD commentaries of Mr. Show all four seasons and they described that and yeah they were talking about how they watch that show and they thought he was funny and so they wanted to do a bit about it and they and one of them I think it was uh Paul of Tomkins described watching the show and there was one bit where he's describing like a really horrible like abduction rape and murder case and he describes the uh the the the the suspects as goofs he says the two goofs then proceeded to the... second location, yeah, they were podcast, weren't they? that was the first like podcast, god, i remember the uh, the one of the best i've ever i ever watched was the uh, was the i think step brothers dvd commentary with Adam mccay, which made me weep with laughter, almost as funny as the movie, it was and the bit was is that they brought. Rolls who was recording in the studio on a different set, they brought him in to just talk, even though he had no idea anything about the movie or any of them, it was really funny. I do love Adam, I'm sorry, the guy is a formative comedic influence, even before even before the movies, there was uh his legendary SNL sketches and apparently that I did not know that recorded yesterday that I knew vaguely that Richard Joel had gone on SNL uh, because Norther McDonald of course, being a anti-government type that he was, he was all over that case and making fun of the FBI and the news media for fucking it up, and uh and he went to New York and he had a little bit with with Norm, but that was the same episode that they did the orange Julia sketch, Stephen Selone, Selon episode, Sylvester, that's amazing, that was delightful to hear, everything coming together, and I I and I, I really think, yeah, there's no way that Eastwood wanted to put any of that stuff in the movie, because he didn't want to give, he didn't want to make like the the media, he didn't want to give them an aw out, because isn't that how the media works, it's like they're they they're totally uh they're completely feckless with people's lives, but then the assumption is if they mess up, well we'll make it up to it, like oh we ruined this guy's life, he gets to go to New York and meet ncdonald, it's fine, like that does anything to the horrible, horror horrible fact that our government has that power to do that to people. Let me keeps asking about Ocelon and Muriy Bushkin, I'll admit I've never read Murray Bushkin, from what I've read and heard there isn't really that much and I know that Ocelon like read Buchkin and decided that that the PPK was going to go from uh from like ML to uh communalist, but the... is I don't know what any of that really means in practice, I don't know what any of it actually refers to, I mean according to everything I've read about the way that uh, like the uh PKK aligned governments in Syria operate, it isn't really that anarchistic, and of course you can say, of course not, it's the middle of a war zone, but it just doesn't seem like it's a terribly relevant example of any kind of theory behind it, I don't, maybe I should read it, I mean the... It just seems like we're in a completely different situation in the US than anywhere that it would be applicable. Oh man, the cult of the supreme being, that's a great one, uh, so these Jacobns when they took power after the... after the uh in the middle of the French revolution uh, there was of course a huge anti-catholic sentiment among the leading uh revolutionaries, because the church was viewed as one of the chief upholders of the old regime and that it maintained this superstitious medieval hold on the peasantry for example that needed to be broken, and so there was a significant anti-christianization campaign in France, uh, I mean, not just things like the van day uh where honestly yeah the infernal columns did a lot of bloody work there and killed people and drowned nuns and and priests uh gave them republican baptisms by drowning them in in the loai river and massacring civilians but it was also a brutal war on the part of you know the the the royal and catholic army i mean they were hacking people to pieces all the time too uh but even beyond that there was was a concerted effort in certain departments by certain zelous uh Jacobs to persecute priests uh to you know commit iconiclasm and to try to uh break the spell that the Catholic Church had over the French people to the extent that it still existed and the thing is though that Robespier that the the guy in charge the chief Jacobbin uh was well of course he was not a catholic uh he was obhorent of the dechristianization campaign because he recognized that virtue does not come from logic alone, virtue has to come from a uh some sense some ritualized sacralized relationship between citizens and the state, the way that the feudal order had between the the god and and and his subjects, because that's where that's where real consent comes from, consent can't really just be generated from authoritarianism, certainly not at that point, given the level of technology, it had to be like socially generated, and the way to do that is to is to have people have a sense of transcendent relationship to something beyond themselves that that the government is a representative of that isn't alien to them, and so what Robespear's idea was was to replace catholicism with something he called the uh, the cult of the... supreme being uh and essentially tried to turn deism into a new catholicism whereby the rituals of religion are paired with a rationallistic appreciation of God as an unmoved mover and nothing else and human affairs as their own and not governed by supernatural actions. It didn't really get out the ground, there was... really only one festival of the supreme being which Robespear uh presided over a few months before thermodor uh and his and I think just before his his ult the last nervous breakdown he had before thermodor he kept having nervous breakdowns and being gone for long periods and he had one right before thermodor and it was during it that a lot of the the thermodorian uh coup plotterers started making connections and being like hey when he comes back we don't want to be on that next. list of of traitors to the revolution, because the funny thing is is that at that point he was going after the like the ideological foes had been had been slain uh the the the real war left like was among among like keeping the permanent revolution going was against corruption and the thing is that the the revolutionary government was wildly corrupt uh and a lot of the most corrupt ones been killed yet thought they might be in the next round of uh persecutions but anyway so just before that the last like the the the high point of the of his of his reign, the high point of the Robesbyan reign of terror uh for him, I think anyway, according to to witnesses, he was beaming uh, was the festival of the supreme being, and it was a procession and there was a big float and it was like a goddess of reason, and he was just he was chiving like crazy, but uh, it was also a, it ended up being one of the things that bro his hold over people because everyone else basically there in the crowd and among the dignitaries was kind of embarrassed uh and it was essentially a cringe post. the festival of the supreme being was a huge crim cringe post and the entire group of people was cringiing, and even though this was still the terror and people's heads were getting cut off for the merest denunciation from a neighbor, people were hackling robspier, people were telling him to fuck off, that's how cringe inducing it was, uh, and that's because you can't do what he wanted to do. you can't just say, hey you guys, you know your socially embedded religious traditions that have you know that are deeper in your mind than and than conscious thought almost because of how how much your life has been shaped by them, forget that, i got this other stuff, it'll do the same thing though, it'll be fine, it's like catholicism, catholicism, catholicism, we've got catholicism at home, at home some dorky looking paper mache uh lady in a toga. but I will say that I at least give Robespear credit for recognizing that what the dechristianizers wanted to do was a non-starter, at least at that level of coersive capacity of the state, it was a peasant country, and and and they didn't have the mechanized ability to suppress the peasantry the way that the soap Bolsheviks would, uh, oh, this is good was. was a period when people started to think the guillotine thing was crinch, that's true, uh, there were a number of ex of of of of notable executions at the latter half of the reign of terror that started to clearly turn people, one of them was Dantant, because Dantant was one of the most popular figures of the revolution, incredibly charismatic, well-liked, uh, probably guilty of corruption as he had been accused of, uh, but he's the guy that people like to point to as the what if what if guy, because he seems like he had the capacity to rule of a guy like Rob Spear, but without Robespear's brittle and paranoid nature uh, but oh well, he ended up on the wrong and he left Paris at the wrong time, honestly that didn't help, um, but that's cuuse you know he knew where his bread was butter, but anyway the execution of Danton was not popular uh, and of course you've got the fact that uh, he was such a fucking baller on the tumbral, his last words were to the to the guy who picks the... the head the executioner who then takes the head out of the basket and shows the crowd, he said, make sure the crowd sees it, it's worth a look, because he had this incredibly huge head that was uh, people, people said it was like erotically ugly, he had he had a big scar on his chin from when he got gored by a bull as a child, and he had like pig nose and he was broad, lot of like smallpox scars and he was just still like sexually mesmerizing. and incredibly uh uh he was a chad, he was an absolute chad, whereas Robespier was also unattractive if you've ever seen a buster picture and also pox guard, but a little nausiish little dude, they called him the sea green incorruptible because he was always looked like he was gonna puke, he was wildly unhealthy, and his voice was uh high-pitched and and tremulous, he was, it's kind of amazing that he got where he was, it was it was because he was the one he was the most hysterical person during a period of mass hysteria which... i like to point out was the fault of the drandans, it was the fault of the fucking brisoists, the guys who go down in liberal history as these innocent victims who wanted a real real liberal revolution that would have given over uh to the people uh you know a a new France with with real liberty and real ability to rise and fall by merit instead of the crazy uh uh blood ritual. that it turned into that necessitated then the thermodorian reaction and then finally napoleon uh but one of the planks of the because the thing and and and there's a lot of reasons that's bullshit, one is there wasn't a lot of actual ideological difference between the garandus and the Jacobns, like they did not have a lot of policy differences, you could say things like executing the king, but there were plenty of Jarandaus who wanted to execute the king, and there were some Jacobs that didn't want to execute uh and and a lot of them because they were against the death penalty on principle. um, the big thing they were on, the difference was is that the the garandans wanted to declare war on Austria, the Gerandas wanted to export this liberal revolution across Europe and break the chains of feudalism wherever they found them, and it was Robear was said, don't do it, Robespear, I said in a I think last week I said he said, the only thing people hate more than a... missionary is an armed missionary and at that point brow and his boys are like, fuck that, we're going to do it, and then it starts going poorly as you could have imagined, and that is when the tenner of the whole. thing changed because people started to freak out that the austrians were going to show up and kill everybody, that's when you have the september massacress and then that inevitably is going to lead to the people sees that moment of fear most efficiently, most effectively are the ones that are going to take power, and that was the the the gang of hysterics, sean just and uh and um and robespier and the guy in the wheelchair. uh somebody wanted a little background on what i was saying is that i'm sorry is that for a while before buse in the French revolution after the king is finally deposed. you had factions within the the the the the the national assembly and the first the ruling faction uh that executed the king was uh called the jirandus they were all named after the places that they held meetings and they were all uh they were usually named after one or another medieval order that owned the monastery they stayed in. and he had the Jurandis and you had the Jacobns, also known as the mountain, on the left wing of the chamber and stood up at the back, and uh, eventually, after after the ruling Geirandans went to war with Austria and fucked it up, the Jacobns took power and started chopping everybody's heads off, but then the worst started going well, the tide of his area went away and what was left was people who saw a bunch of weirdos trying to build new religions in the middle of uh piles of commenur on and the place de vendome and said let's get rid of these guys which then led to the the directory which is such an amazing government when you look at it it was purely cynical i mean it was made up of the most cynical members of the revolutionary leadership the ones who had survived until that point the only way you'd survived but till thormodor is if you didn't have any principles, because if you had any principles, you either got out of government or you got killed, and so they just spent five years going playing wackamole with the left and the right, while ruling from the center in a completely from a hollow center, which is essentially where we are now, the differences is that we don't yet have a situation of like uh crisis and uh failure of state capacity whereby. like the masses are genuine threat, because the the the whoever was ruling in Paris on a day to day basis depended essentially and could get as many people, who could get as most people in a place at one time, who can bring as many people to the front of a palace at the at the same time, they generally had the run of the city, which is not the case anymore. and that's what necessitated Napoleon, but the thing is is that Napoleon was was the process, was the product of the revolution, right? he was he was a minor noble, but but so minor that he never would have been in a position of power within the military, he wouldn't have been a general uh in the in the yanshant regime, like the revolution gave him both the uh the social freedom. move at his own uh talents, but also the the the field where he could express those talents, a constant war with the rest of Europe. what do we got now? uh, meritocracy has been replaced by this uh, because of course, and this is inevitable, this is why meritocracy is a lie, because even if you start off from a meritocratic position of pure equality and let everybody go, as soon as those distributions of resources are fixed and they're not replaced, as long as you're not doing like a bacooning 100% of state tax, nobody gets to send any money to their kids at all, and honestly even if you did that because there's still social position and in and like just uh early childhood development and access to more's values, social connections beyond money that would render even clowing back from maritoocracy at the over time render it less, but now in our country it's going to the time is going to be much shorter because there's barely any clawback uh, it's almost impossible to lose a fortune in this country, because almost all is kept intact, because that's how our system is designed to work. and so it's it's now even that early meritocracy is burned out completely and it's just reproducing uh an elite copies and copiess and copies like uh like in multiplicity and we are at like the 15th Michael Keton at this point copied off of the 14th Michael Keton who was copied off the 13th Michael Keatan and then what is their experience get uh shuffling papers around in a series of absolutely unwinnable wars that aren't even designed to be one, they're designed to be had, just like our arguments on the fucking internet, our arguments on the internet are just like our fucking colonial wars, they are there to be had, they're there to chew up time and resources, they're not there to achieve objectives, so I mean Napoleon was fighting for an army that was fighting for its life, his first uh big success was fighting against an internal insurgency, the city of taloon which had separated after the the seagure power of the Jackovins had succeeded from France and taken English help and was besieged for months by the French army and had to be had to and had to be uh seat taken by thanks almost single-handedly napoleons wiles. If there's a if there's a taloom now, if there's a taloom now, you're not supposed to take it, you're just supposed to stay in the lines, you're you're supposed to be there, you're supposed to chew up time and resources, you're supposed to uh be a place on a budget line for more fucking uh armored personnel carriers and and and small arms and and missiles and drones to go, you're not supposed to do anything. and then after that napoleon he marches and and goes into Italy and just singlehandedly wipes out the fucking Austrian forces there, you're not supposed to do that, you couldn't do it if you wanted to, for one thing because there isn't any army that we can fight that way, and even though and that's how we're what we're designed to do, but the enemies we do fight we're not supposed to beat, there's no napoleon, no all the system, the sys the the the explosion of uh of possibility, the society and ferment turmoil and and from that growth that revolutionary France was, we are we're we are absolutely in the opposite situation, where all of our social conditions are only driving us closer and closer to uh to this apocalyptic stasis, because there's no one with the will or ability to push against the algorithm. they're just going to let it reduce everything down to its component profit until there's just a little pile of fucking gold bars and a pile of fucking bones and that's it, and of course you know if everything does collapse and then I don't think that's going to happen. I that would not be an environment that's going to create dynamic, it's not going to select. for talent, I'll just say that, apparently it's clear on the west coast now, which is nice, the fires are kind of down, are the fires not on at all, how what how how more fire on fire, how much more on fire is California than it was a week ago? 50% more or 50, 50% is on fire, 30% is on fire, 100% as on fire, 120% as on fire, i have no idea because you only hear the story at first and then some point you just sort of assume, well it took itself, took care of itself, so now other people are telling me it's not clear at all, all right? well never mind, fuck me for asking, 420 baby, 420, it's 420 degrees clear, people say that like in jersey and shit it was all orange, i guess it was a little orange the other night, but i don't i don't really, i don't think that i observed much in the way of west coast smoke and haze. Yosemity mega eruption of a volcano in 2020, we should be so lucky, wouldn't that kind of solve global, wouldn't that solve climate change, right? because it would call like, it would cause a catastrophic cooling, right? and it would also probably reduce CO2 emissions really drastically, very quickly. I wouldn't kill everybody, it wouldn't even, it wouldn't even, I don't even think it would kill everybody in North America, right? depending on how big the explosion was of course, I haven't seen all of bong jong ho's movies, I really liked snow piercer because it was very... hard on it sleeve allegory, which i really like, i sold you guys how much i love mother, i feel like if i feel like there's this idea that the metaphor in your movie isn't subtle, it's not good, and i just don't think that's true, it's all about what you're doing with it, what you're trying to express with it, and there are plenty of ways that a very heavy-handed metaphor can work with other elements of the story you're trying to tell to make a good movie, subtlety on itself, just cuz what that is is that essentially says a good... movie, an artistic movie is one that uh, one that certain people are able to discern, right? not everybody, not for everybody cuz most people are dumb, it takes a certain type of iQ, a smartness if you will, to be able to discern what's being said, and that that makes a good movie, and I don't think that's what art is anyway, I mean that's a way to critically analyze movies, I think, and it's a useful way because there are ways that subtlety of metap or can in certain situations be an expression of a greater uh like narrative uh narrative ingenuity or like a formal statement, but I think that that what it really is is about, it's about feeling something that you can't explain, you should be able to explain it to some degree to other people, but there should be a... really great art, there's a certain part of its appeal that will always be outside of your ability to express, you can feel it and maybe you can kind of get it, but you can't really translate it to other people, it's it's ineffable, if you can pin down the value and like, oh here's the metaphor and here's what it means and here's what it says about trump or whatever the fuck, i think well all right, that's a schematic for this piece of art, but like the soul is somewhere else and and i think that's one of the really negative impacts of uh the recap culture that helped create the prestige tv moment that like reinforced the tropes and basically and told creators what they wanted to see and what they were to respond to is that a lot of these shows even the good ones they feel like they a lot of the elements in them exist explicit you can kind of see the seams you can see where oh this is for the critics to point out this is for someone to recap this and then they can create a pat explanation for what this episode means that's going to be deeper than the message of an episode of CSI Miami, right? It's going to say more about the human condition, but it's still mechanistic, it's it's still, it's still craft, it's not art. I think the show, the show that always gets me with that the most is far ago, which I think is very good, but I think the parts of it that aren't good are the parts where I can see, oh, this is for the critics. I think I'm I I wasn't going to watch Devil all the time because it's two hours and it's a bunch of like British pr public school boys in short pants pretending to be hill billies which is very tiresome to me but our pats is going. again might have to watch it, although I really do not like his performance in the rover that a lot of people like, and that seems like kind of a that seems like a defining wacky rock patent or like committed patents and performance, and if you don't like that, I don't, I don't know, maybe I won't like him in that either. Oh, and uh, that reminds me, so this is one thing I wanted to talk for about for a while, and I'll end with this, in the in the context of talking about like the new critical understanding of television specifically, not, no, no, not just television, all art, but specifically the narrative art forms, television and movies, the stuff that we've convinced ourselves is where uh, all the horrors of this country originate. not a reflection of them, but that's what we get, we are all, we're all Tipper Gore, we're all PMRC people, we all believe that what we get out of culture is what we then do, we believe that, I think there'... there's no other unders, there's no other way to understand the way people talk about art now in exclusively political terms, why would that be the only thing you cared about, unless it had some sort of significant impact on your life? it's like really really getting into the score and only talking about score, if that was the only thing anybody talked about movies, people would be like, what's going on, why what's with the score thing, and like maybe that would be a weird like uh, that would probably have some sort of material explanation too, but it would be a different one. i think the the answer for why we do it now is cuuse we desperately want to think that this thing that is all we absorb all day, spectacle has to be the seat of meaning and the seat of change, because we can't imagine anything else, we can't imagine the real world anymore, being a place where we do anything else, but and reenact the shit we saw on the internet, which is where we really live and the stuff we see in media. and that has created a uh a new sort. of critical artistic tailorism where or or positivism, i'm not not sure which word specifically to use, essentially what i'm saying is that we have replaced evaluating art, narrative art, we have replaced evaluating narrative art as a complex artistic enterprise with varying elements within it that we are going to evaluate for them and then see how they operate together to make a greater, a greater thing, a thing greater than some of its parts, that's what art is, you got these parts, if it's good art, there's something that comes out above them, the something that comes and emates from them, if it's shitty art, it's just the things, now art is a purely commercial, or it's a purely propagandistic product, and the only metric is good content, bad content as in stuff that will make people act good versus stuff that will act make people act bad, good ideas, bad ideas and then watching something is just clicking like an umpire or one of those, you just wait and see, okay, how many we got now? all right, we got 15 good things and 13 bad things, this is a good movie, we got 17 good things and 12 bad things, that's a good movie, we got four good things and nine 90 bad things, this is movie we have to drag and actually you know what people shouldn't see it, and if they do, they're bad people, and I think the reason for that is not, it's not malevolent, people aren't doing it because they're becoming like hysterical philistines because of SJWism, it's because there's no, there's nothing else in movies, the art part is being drained out of them because capital is totally overwhelming them, the artistic, the artistic impulse that has to be part and parcel any artistic endeavor is in these commercialized art forms almost gone, it's been deluted to parts per million, and now that doesn't mean there still isn't great art, but it's just harder to find and it's more concentrated, and the average piece of art has less of it than it used to. think of blockbusters that nobody would say are great art or shouldn't say are great art from the 80s versus blockbusters of today, and then remember the fact that that is even more hegemonic, like blockbusters are a larger percentage of our... of our of our movie diet and and uh tv is larger percentage which is a more adulterated life art form than film. everything is just being drained of art so what is left? what can we talk about? well you can talk about like uh individual elements like but that's essentially about whether hot dog is a sandwich, it's boring uh it's brittle. talking about the political element that invests it with emotion. the emotion that we couldn't feel for it anymore because it's bad art. the emotion that we feel for art that comes from uh connection to it has been replaced with a connection emotional connection related to our political beliefs, because we can find it there, it's the only thing left in it that we can resonate with uh emotionally, anything else that we would resonate with is gone, so we have to recreate what art is and turn it into this propaganda exercise where the good and bad are pure just objective tallies within the movie, which means we don't have to think about it. we don't have to express our disconent about it, we can we can, it's essentially a way to cope with our closing historical, our closing artistic horizons, is because as the like the the uh the edges come in, you know, and as it as as as there's less good stuff, more bad stuff, bad stuff is worse, good stuff isn't as good, and there isn't those, there aren't those high points, and there'... isn't even that basic level of engagement and satisfaction, that creates disconent, like this shit, this is a shit, it sucks, but it's also one of our chief forms of soothing, is how we get through this shit, it is our opium, not in the bad sense, but in the 19th century sense, as a medicine, as palliative care for like getting a bullet pulled out of your fucking arm at chancellorsville, it is necessary bomb for the soul to continue living under this exploitative system, so you but the system's not going anywhere, we're fucked, we're in it, capital realism baby, so we have to accept the shitty stuff as our only sucker and therefore decide the... the artistic value is the political value because nothing else is worth looking for or could be found, and that and part of that process is that as we put more and more of our politics into our cultural diet, our politics become more uh of of a entertainment too, like as entertainment gets more political, politics get more entertaining. and now because we care about things we watch as a level of politics like we watch our art to get a jolt of either righteous rage or uh or vindication, we we get it from our art and we also get it from watching the news or scrolling our twitter feed or going to facebook to post a meme, it's all the same, it's been flattened, because in the same way that art has been drained out of our uh art, politics has been drained out of our politics, politics is similarly denatured of any any, in this case the art that the place of art would be uh accountability to actual citizens of this fucking country, it's being adulterated out and denatured and replaced with spectacle, and our emotional investment in the spectacal of it, who the good guys are are winning, yay, the bad guys are winning, boom. and that is why people arguing about what the whether it's moral to vote for Biden, it's like my god, you are just, you're you are knowing your own flesh, how do you not see that this is a completely sterile argument that is just like batman could beat the terminator and serves the same purpose, to waste time to just go around in circles, to give you a joult every day up until the big joult, the big game. election day and there's a come down and then you're like, okay, that was intense, and then you get a refractory period, but then as things keep getting worse, and we need more and more of that opium, we need more of that balm gillad to get through the day, what's this? oh shit, we're invested again, and we get to go back up on the fucking, we get to go back to the top of the goddamn drop at the cyclone, oh until the next election, that's the exact same, it's all part of one continuous process of self-amusement in the face of armagedden and personal alienation to the point of of uh of misery, of mass death, I mean, huge, huge, huge rais raise of of suicides, uh, drug overdoses, uh, people are just checking the fuck out, depression, they're checking out, because none of this is enough anymore, but the people who are still able to function are putting more and more into this because it's the only button they have. It's the only button they can press, it's the morphine drip in the hospital fucking, it's the hospice morphine drip, hitting it over and over again, every time we're arguing about Biden, every time you're going to watch and see if tenat is uh, you know, is more dude bro uh than interstellar, the talk you talk about whether uh uh like there's sufficient intersectionality uh in the green new deal or in the Marvel cinematic universe, you're hitting the goddamn fucking morphine. the non-ngaged are people who are get their uh get their opium elsewhere a lot of them it in the form of actual opium or at this point fetanil which is the uh which is the like tick of uh of morphine or whatever if you want to talk about like... the accelerated end point of this thing, like Trump is the fentinol of politics's theater uh, like black panther is the pinnacle of like politics as culture uh and fentinill is the fentinil of just trying not to feel the pain of living and other ones uh personal drama uh or they're just trying to survive. and and and their their their uh opium comes in the form of the relief that they're still able to keep their head above water for another day and they're not even thinking about any other shit masz. hierarchy of needs shit, what and like all of these are the worst, most deadly, most refined, artificial, capital processed versions of this generalized cultural need to south the pains of exploitation through through some sort of uh ritualized consensus. and I would say, don't do that, don't do, don't do that one either, my god, all these need to be uh, ashued, uh, we have to confront the pain of our our alienation, and instead of seeing how hard it will be to change and say, oh well, better flee towards uh pleasure, recognize that that pleasure will never be enough, that pleasure will always be just beyond one's grasp and it will always leave you maddened with thirst and that the only way forward for yourself is to confront the pain and uh try to transform it, try to change your relationship to the pain, and that's the beginning of spirituality, i think because you don't because spirituality is what let you is what allows you to live in the absence of this, and allows you to live in the absence of hope that you can get things better in your life, in a in a material way, because that's not going to happen. someone just said, I love to coom, man, that's gross. I'd say it gets worse, but it gets better, how about that, and that the fate of any human and the fate of the species is how many people and when break or what time you break, one way or the other. should i try and leave the state to stay at fight? you can't man, we're we're we're in here for good, they won't let us out, can you believe it? the only way out is through, the best way I can kind of condense everything into, cuz a lot of what I talk about on here is about how how captured we feel, how trapped we feel? how out of options, how how how habson's choiced we are, and it's true, but the implication of that should not be some sort of pathetic nialism that just ends up being more self-absorption, more uh consumption, more hollow vapidness, it's just from a like one more remove of irony, or try to conquer them, and that's by not finding the false wall that seems that of the walls. enclosing, one of them is false, and you have to find the one that's false, as in what are you worrying about, what is causing you pain, what is making your life miserable that doesn't have to, like that you are essentially in some way or another choosing to make, choosing to project there, because the the the wanting you have is so powerful, the want you feel is so intense that... projects this wall, and that if you would confront that want and find that maybe you don't need that thing, then that wall disappears and you can move, but I don't know what it is, it's it's for everyone else, every individual, and that's what's so maddening and terrifying about this moment, is it's going to come down a lot of it to how many people are able to just sit, to sit with themselves long enough to and knock and feel. and find the false wall, all right, and maybe I answer one question and I'll piece out. the funniest, i'll i'll leave on this, the funniest president other than Trump, all right, you got to go with when they are president, so they're funny presidents, man, they really aren't very funny. as a group, Nixon's pretty funny obviously just because of the face and the no and the voice and and all that. I guess taffed because he was fat, got stuck in a bathtub, that's classic hyjinks and when you consider how much comedy back then revolved around like a fat guy getting into hijinks, it was essentially like uh Hardy from Laural and Hardy was president, I have. say though, people make fun of Taff for getting stuck in the bathtub? I'm pretty sure that if I tried to go in the bathtub that he got stuck in, I'd get stuck in it, because he looks like a big fat guy in the pictures and he's remembered as the fattest president, but he was like 300 pounds, which in modern context in America is not that big and he was tall, so uh, those bathtubs were made for people who were much smaller, so if I got in that exact back to I probably get my ass stuck in it. All right guys, see you, bye-bye.
