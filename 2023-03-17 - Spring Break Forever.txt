 the place where lovers go to cry their troubles away and they call it lonesome town where the broken hearts stay going down the lone some town where the broken h don't stay going down to lone some town to cry my troubles away in the land of broken dreams, the streets are paved with regrets, maybe now in some town, i can learn to forget, billy ran around with a raro crew in as some titan glue, ahound blue, really saw a copper in that, six for f to, hit him right the doray me the... that copper won't be wearing any family, hey billy son, where are you now? don't you know that we need you now, the old tata and the old pall billy bones rested now, billy went away with a peacekeeping force cuuse he loved up blood good fight of course, ran away in a big kicky band to the backs of the lily jordan, billy saw the arabs and he had them on the run so he had them in the range of a simicean gun, had the Israelis in his site to the ratata, they ran like shally son, where are you now, don't you know that we need you now, the old to out where our billy bones rested now, one night billy had a rare old time laughing and is singing on the leven line, came in the camp, not looking too pretty, never even got to see the holy city, now billy's out there in the desert sun, and his mother cries when the morning comes and there's mothers crying all over this world. for the poor little darling boys and girls, got plug on a tuesday, sick on a friday, barried on a Sunday, i'm not going to wear blue uh green even though it is my favorite color and i have plenty of green outfits, not gonna not gonna cout out of the phenians, no thank you fucking potato munchers came over to america and in and immediately said hey uh, if you give us guns, we will be your thuggish enforcers of capitalism, way to go, they came over here and they're like, hey, as long as we're not at the bottom of the racial hierarchy, we will uh kill anybody that you ask us to, and you know what, rational decision in the context, nothing you blame them for, everybody does what the incentives drive them to do, you can judge people individually, although in the end we only ever judge ourselves, but as an aggregate you can never judge anyone because people are moving in the through the shoot as it's been designed, if things change, if there's eruptions of resistance, they emerge, out of disruption, uh, moments, specific moments. of disruption of of overflow, overflow of uh rage, overflow of fear, and new forms of resistance emerge out of that. when things are going uh as planned, things kind of just have a brutal accumulatory logic, and what is accumulated is human activity that is then turned into culture, and and then directed backward towards us. so yeah, can't blame the Irish too much, but certainly no reason to die a fucking river for them, good a lord, get over it, but and that is why uh, anybody wants to get rid of columbus day, I'm sorry, you got to think of something better to trade the ch the uh trade to the Italians. Sorry. Because. they are another one of those perilous white groups that came in late and still have the memory, the the the social memory of not quite being American, of course it's a joke now because it's been literally generation since then, but that feeling of not being part of America, it's deeply um enticing, everybody wants a piece of that really, including people who think they love America, they want to feel in some way divorced from culpability with the broader American project even a reactionary has parts of America's project that they're horrified by one way or the other and being a subject to America rather than a embodiment of America allows for that so everybody wants that everybody seeks that regardless of where they are politically and that's why the concept of identity politics uh is so absurdly used and used in a way that's me. to abolish understanding rather than increase it, because all politics is identity politics, that's what we have instead of uh class politics, there's a material base to it, and there is a client relationship between identity groups, where there's an understanding, explicit or implicit that your group getting in there will be represented in part by government, larges flowing in one direction, one way or the other. That's it, the only thing that disrupts that is class politics that cuts through identity, because it's separate, it is, it is not one identity among other, it is the identity that structures all the other ones, lens is the class, what we do with our day, or if our labor is exploited, taken from us if we live off of the labor of others, the experience of living as member of a class is the emotional folkrum catalyst for all of our understandings of every other element of our identity and as such it's can't be represented among them culturally and isn't it has to emerge from struggle and we built in this country briefly cultural organs of class struggle but they have all been absorbed into now the post-class American political uh and media economy. hey, germans don't need a fucking parade, they got an entire month, they got the month of October, and they got the fest of October, which is usually in September, because you're getting excited about October show, call that whole month. but the reason the Germans don't have a holiday isn't just that the German Germany did World War One and Two and that made German Americans very quick to kind of get rid of their little special part of separation because it's connected too much to the to the specific German project unlike you Ireland and Italy. I mean yes Italy fought World War II but you know uh that wasn't even really the high point of anti-german sentiment in America that was world war one when Italy was an ally. a lot of it is that the Germans got the land, the Germans showed up in time to get the land. The big German immigrations to the United States happened in the mid 19th century, the 48 uh rebellion is a big pusher, but even a little before that and after that uh, and it started as we talked about a couple weeks ago, it started in eastern Pennsylvania in the colonial era, so that means... that you get this middle strata of of uh peasants with enough money to be able to come to America, but not enough security in their uh employment to stay in Germany comfortably, they come here and they're able to grab some of that free real estate and they fill in the mid-west all through the 19th century, creating these nodes that bring in people, which is always how it always works early adapters create uh, family networks that pull people like with capillary action across the ocean, because you know somebody there, you know a cousin or something, you would, it's much more difficult to go cold turkey to another country, so people go where their their people are, so the mid-west fills up with these crowds who get the land and then they get to be beneficiaries of the American uh project uh, but of course there are those who bring their socialism with them and who try to assert on the centrality of socialism to German identity, and they do have outside influence in in politics, we have the the sewers socialists uh in Milwakee only came to power because of the German immigrant population there, but again that's the ones who are in the cities, the people if you have the Germans filled in the land, they become the backbone of the post war republican party, post civil war republican party, the small holder class, the when the Irish show up, they show up at the same time as the Germans, but the Irish who show up are the brokest boys in the continent, they're not making, they're not, because there was a bliight across all of Europe in the early 50s, that's why it's called the hungry fifth, early 1840s, it's why it was called hungry 40s and it's why you had the 48 rebellions there, because things were bad, harvests were destroyed, the potato blate affected potato crops all across Europe and potatoes had been brought in across through the atlantic the Atlantic exchange, the American Exchange, brought to Europe. to fill in the calories of uh of farmers so that they could grow more cash crops, so everybody was having a bad time, but in in Germany, you know, it was not the fucking holocaust of devastation that it was in Ireland, the difference, iron was a fucking colonial holding of England, they treated it the way they treated India, that means. Americans to come or the Germans come during this period, they have a they have a fucking nickel to rub together and they can set themselves up in America, the Irish got nothing, the Irish are fleeing literally death or being enslaved on a road gang or being get stealing travellian's corn and being transported to Australia, so the ones who came to America just huddled next to the shore, and they took the first job that. was offered to them, which was from the state in one form or another, as part of the uh political machines that emerged among these workers, these uh urban irish to leverage their position in the society, like hey, we are at the very least, we are here and there's numbers of us and we could be organized to vote a certain way, and they create um political machines that generate patronage and a way for Irish people to make wages that is preferable to... the one thing everybody in America is trying to avoid wage uh a wage relationship with a private employer so they they gave the guns and see here shoot shoot the other patties and and we'll keep you above the blacks and they said deal the Italians show up a little later after the uh Italy is reorganized uh and uh unified as one country so that... and it so it takes a while once that thing is stitched together for the vast numbers of uh uh for the uh modernization of agriculture in southern Italy to start throwing people off the land the way it had in northern uh northern Europe decades generations before the fact that in uh that industrialized urbanized northern Italy and rural southern i were different completely different political organs until the mid 19th century means that you do not have this uh the modernizing impact of those of that capital there where a time when you're dealing with much more nationalized economies before you really have the the world system pulling everybody in one direction so the thing that does it first before that is industrialization and urbanization. and pulling people to cities and then uh modernizing agriculture and reducing the amount of labor inputs needed to do agriculture. Italy doesn't get that until the mid- 19th century so it's in the late 1800s that you have these huge numbers of uh of extra miles in southern Italy who can no longer hang around in the fucking countryside. they come over here and the cop jobs are gone so they become cops for. criminals, they become the fucking mafia, which of course is fused with the police, at a fundamental level, organized crime and the police are one organ, are one uh structure of uh violence enforcement of the broader economic system in the white market and in the black market, but the same job, what is it that Henry says in good, the mafia is the police department for wise guys? are the same guys and they are weld together uh in their own way the same way that the political class is with the uh capital holders bribes. we don't call them that in the political class because they've legalized it, but at the grassroots here, at the level of corruption, which is the same exact thing that we're doing legally, it's just it has to be off the menue because it's dealing with a part of the economy that while necessary for the economy to function, be legally acknowledged by the greater economy and by the legal system, has to catch the economic activity that is pathological to the to the social system, but generated by that social system nonetheless, like you have capitalist, you have a bunch of people packed into miserable cities working in factories, they're going to want to do vice, they're going to want to do criminal shit, they're going to have to do criminal shit, so how is that organized? to minimize uh destable the destabilizing social effect of crime and that's what organized crime does so the italians show up later and it's like no all the cop jobs are taken here you be the cops of the criminals but even and and the way you know that it's the same thing is that it had the same uh effect of upward mobility among the immigrant italian population that the irish becoming copsted, because few generations later, boom, the Italian and the Irish, they now are, they're all now in the same fucking cities in or the same towns in long island, they're all living next to each other cheek in long island for example, the fredericches next to the... mallis and then to fill it out, the people who came last and uh were left uh to the to their own devices of the Jews, you got you got one three, it's like a third and third and third in in uh long island between the Italians, the irishans Jews, but That's what happens when you show up late to the party and without any money to to move to really move once you get to America, you just you settle into the crevices at the at the uh edge, at the water's edge, the middle is filled with the big fat square germans. and you can tell that the polacks show up later because they end up filling the same role uh in Chicago and everybody is doing what they're doing to to make it because the emergence of meaningful class consciousness never really takes off in America during this whole period, it's it's banked off. by uh the the expansionary project, the same way it was banked off by the colonial project in Europe, but even more effectively because you're integrating these things into the system, as opposed to creating this perpetual periphery, you are incorporating the periphery, and that means opportunities to live as Americans, grow over time, stop and then we all go and say, all right, so what I want to talk about today, little bit, if we can make sense of it, it's to follow up on last week when I said that the our battle of army. already happened and that we are now living uh in a permanently fallen world where God has fled, Jesus has been cast into the outer darkness and Satan rules unchallenged. what does that practically mean? uh, I think it should be seen as liberating, as freeing and not as something to uh, to repent and nash your teeth of. and feel uh um and to feel the fuck disheartened by to to be to be... uh made inert to be paralyzed by, it should be, so he's mad that we didn't talk about the jacobites and hell hell on earth, we wanted to tie it off at 1688, because that is the year that I think this whole thing is knitted together into a functioning organ of power uh, but we will talk about the Jacobites in our bonus episode where we get to some of the stuff that we we we miss but wanted to talk about and uh also answer some questions from listeners, things that they want clarified or they want more information on, so we're still going to do that, I'll talk about the jackbites that, but the jackbites uh are very interesting, sore some fucking sore luger lugers, losers there, uh, yeah, we're actually thinking we might do a shorter, maybe three four episodes uh series on the seven years war uh because which occurs in the uh 17 60s, 1750s and 60s uh, so about about 100 years after we end, or about like 75 years after we end the narrative, uh, because well, our the 30 years war story sort of ends with England as this new thing, this new state, okay, with this new capacity, uh, the rest of Europe isn't going to be sort of forced into unleashing their own bourjois and playing the game by the same rules that the British are until they win the seven years war. that is what gets the uh that walenstinian world system cranking into overgrive is the British conquering uh British being the brit British being the winner in the uh continent contest with France uh for control of the colonial world. because you see what the the losing the seven years war does to France, it causes an almost instantaneous economic crisis that echoes through a few decades and leads to a fucking revolution, but the so they're having their but when France is having their uh English civil war moment right, which is what the the French revolution is, by that point, uh, victorious Britain has entered the industrial revolution, it industrial revolution really gets kicked into overdrive by the military uh economy that had been built during the seven years war, because it is wars that build the capital necessary to make uh technological advancements, that's what motivates money, capital to flow to... science is the practical application of it of its military use, that is the only thing that is uh, that's the necessity that sharpens the state's uh interests towards that funding, so this means that France even with all of its huge advantages, it was the state of western Europe, uh, it was the place with the... most people, the most rich agriculture, the biggest city, they ended up behind the eight ball, they never really industrialized, europe, france was still disproportionately uh agrarian well into the late 19th century, which by the way is why the french uh, even though they had that revolutionary tradition were not the uh place where uh the... movement became effective and and coordinated, that was Germany, like we when uh, when we blame the the the social democrats in Germany for not for voting for war credits in 1914, one of the things that one of the things that made them make that decision, yes they were craven opportunits, yes they were, they were fat cats, they they wanted to keep the... job, that's part of it, but they were making what they thought were rational interest uh decisions made in the interest of the movement, and one of the things that made them make that decision is they had no, there was no comparable french socialist movement that they could have coordinated a mutual uh, general strike with or something like that, like there was no partner in France for the German social democrats to say, hey, you and if we guys both promise to vote now on more credits and to mobilize our unions to to uh resist mobilization, we'll do it together. They didn't have. a partner there because France never really uh industrialized because they didn't want to, because nobody wants to. that's the whole point here, nobody wanted to do this except for a very thin strata of of motivated uh god touched uh incandescent merchant types, the the the uh landowners didn't want to do this, the peasants didn't want to do it. artisans didn't want to do it, no one wanted to do capitalism, and france, because of their robust uh democratic traditions, pull back the rains, they don't let what, they don't let uh what, they they don't let the the state or the capitalist class due to them what the English allowed their capital. class to them was just pulled them into these giant cities by the by the bushiel load, clear the countryside and turned them into fucking factory workers, on anywhere near the scale, because uh English politics had been drained of the language of social justice, it had been it the market had been turned into a god, its dictates had been turned into God's will, and the political... zone of action was self-consciously shrunk, but the socialist movement is where Christianity stayed, that's the the teleological heart of Christianity, right? there's two, christianity is a teleology, it leads towards which is something that has two conceptions that we imagine of, a good one and a bad one, there is the end of all things as a terrifying, horrifying, mass death event, and then there is the end of all things as the return of Christ and the reveal of a new way of being in the world, that's always been to face that way, what the... Scientific revolution, industrial revolution, and the rise of capitalism in the 19th century did in Europe was to split those permanently. Christianity, as we under as a as a self-conscious religious movement becomes eventually a worship of theself and a denial of that reunion. No thanks, check please, because what they're actually doing is serving capitalism, which pulls them every day farther from themselves. from each other uh, denies the possibility of a reunion with humanity or the planet, insists on eternal, eternal separation, and even though you're a lot of these people really thought this they were Christian, their actions just serve this force that just deepened it over the generations to the point that you get to now where nobody in America, I think really believes in any kind of Christian God. they believe maybe in a supernatural validation of their own best interests, like they brought back paganism, but the apocalypse as a unveiling of a new way of being, that did still live after this big moment of crisis, skismogenesis, but it lived among the... classes, because their relationship to the system was fundamentally self-consciously alienated in a way that the small bourgeois who make culture and make religion under the regimes of capital uh, don't feel it, that means they can countenance the... end of the system as such, for for the bourgeois, the end of the system is the end of them, it's the annihilation that is a kind to being cast into the lake of fire. because they feel dependent for their position upon this system, and they feel, they feel the resentment of those who work for them, one way or the other, how however they try to deny it, it's felt, it's all, our bodies inscribe all of this fucking stuff, so the socialist movement becomes the residue, of christianity and marx emerges as the prophet of it, the person who can take this ambient feeling, give it shape, form, program, scripture, i know this is facil, but you can't have a social movement, if it's counter hegemonic, if it's not depending on the existing structures of of coersion and "there's nothing is, nothing works in any other way than this, so does your your precious rationalist capitalism is is fueled by religious texts and a religious understanding of the world, it's just made invisible, because that's what capitalism does, that's why it allows, that's why people will allow it to make them do things that they would have found abhorent if they had any" regard for their fellow man, because the it's not their responsibility, that is the free, that is the lucifer in the ear, that is what thou likes to live deliciously for for western uh christian capitalists and so for people like that, anything that is like a self-conscious uh consciously based on a faith in something is anathema, but their faith is is just it's a dark faith, it's like it's dark matter, it cannot be read by the person who's been idealized to it, who's been uh fully propagandais to it, and so when the great moment came, the the the real uh armagedden trumpet was blown in 1914, which is when the thing starts, when when buse world war one is not just this battle between these uh European empires who are competing over uh uh resources and markets, it is, it is systems trying to survive the eruption of social crisis. at their heart that happens when you get x number of people with y amount of technology, meaning that regular people are able to create their own parallel structures, to demand power and to exercise it that had traditionally been monopolized by the ruling class, that has to be dealt with, and it's that contradiction that fuels everything else and leads to world war 1, and it's the great triumph. of the capitalist that they get to fight World War One on the in the context of national uh dispute and the national question, which is of course going to happen, it's inevitable to happen, because the bourgeois got rid of God, and they replaced it with the nation, which is just of course them, because the whole thing about Christianity is the... it is universal, which necessarily reduces you, the the individual is contextually downgraded thanks to that universality, when the bourgeois uh triumph, their lang their uh, they have to still use the language of meaning in their culture, everyone everything has to have meaning. so where does meaning come from? it comes from this mystical concept of the nation, which now has made me special again. i'm not just one person among god's children, i'm not just one. of God, I am part of the special elect children of God, which is of course exactly what the Jews did in ancient Mesopotamia to survive in their contest with the other tribes, by the time that the real crisis hits in the early early 19th century, the working class has only barely come into political uh action and cultural formation in most of these countries, but they have had by this point 100 years in many cases to build these notions of nationalism. and who started this? the french, french revolution happens, the working class doesn't really exist yet, you have these these sankulat, these these unemployed artisans, are able to mobilize effectively as a military force essentially in the capital uh, but who uh, whose relationship to production is nothing like what you see later on with the developed cap working class, so they can't take power, so that means that it is sort of taken by these uh, this group of lawyers. uh and merchants, so what do they consecrate? they consecrate the nation, and it's incredibly powerful, they take over the entire continent up behind that shit, because it is a force multiplier, it is a new technology, you can't understand french military dominance during the napoleonic era without understanding nationalism as a technological innovation. among the other innovations that built modern military forces and much of modern European nationalism is a response to that, people getting their asses kicked by the French and going, hey we need some of that, we need some of that nation stuff, that is what kickstarts modern German nationalism, it's this contest, conflict, the the being dominated by an other, because there is no horizon. the horizon has been abolished, because it is what has been totalized is not the concept of a working class in itself, by itself, for all, but instead a every man for themselves and the market as the place to uh battle for supremacy, and so we have this 30 years of violence from 1914 to 1945 that sees Europe destroyed in twice, it sees the entire world become a battlefield that sees the incorporation of China and Japan into this global competitive state framework, but it is only fitfully and occasionally fought uh by self-conscious class elements, most of course, the French, the Russian revolution, the place where capitalism had developed the least during this period, where the crisis of the of the world war one, broke the state and left the only force capable of wielding power, one that was fired by belief in something, nobody else believed in anything, even the right wingers couldn't really believe in the nation anymore, the nation kept getting its ass kicked. so a combination of workers whose experience of alienation had forged them into the revolutionary weapon that marks predicted and a leadership made up of the children of the disaffected children of the other classes with the leisure uh to devote themselves to revolution as a vocation. Now there was a there was a Russian nationalism, I mean they were an empire uh, and they also were been fighting the Ottomans for about 200 years by that point, so there was, but there was a nationalism, but it was protein, and it was very much geared around the royal family, which made their failure in the war disqualifying, and why? were they willing to, why were they able to act in that moment? we've talked about this too, why were the bolscheviks Lenin specifically able to act in 1917, while everyone else was standing around with the... thumbs up their ass, waiting for somebody to do something, while the entire thing just fell apart, because they believed in a, they believed in a apocalyptic horizon, they believe that their victory in Russia would spark a world revolution that would define the rest of human history, they might all die fighting in it, but they would die for something. And you know what, if they've been right, you still would have had 30 years of war from 1914 to 1945, at least, and as many dead, probably, maybe more, but at the end of it, you would have had a human race capable of living as humans again, as capable of imagining collectively a project of building that world that Christ spoke of, in other words a victorious godly army after armagan, the fun part of revelation after all the nastiness has been concluded, the thousand years of peace on earth, even if it's hard, even if it's struggle, even if it's not paradise, the struggle and the... means something because it is a movement towards wholeness and and uh reunion. that is the that's the horizon were pointing towards that every element of the socialist movement during this period was pushing towards, but the tide rolled back because the antibodies that capitalism. the cultural antibodies that builds through technology, through mass technology, labor saving, convenience devices and media, change the fucking, radically change the calculus of a country, the calculus of its citizens, the the decision making matrix of a person in a in a position of power, what do I do in x situation? Yeah, I think if Leon had not died, he and Bucaren would have tried to force them to just capitalize the country by uh, by making a deal with the peasantry, because they were fundamentally incapable of of uh, of undertaking a project of dispossession. like Lenin of course was happy to kill people during the the civil war, you saw he would write these frantic letters, like we got to kill him, we got to kill him, because he thought those deaths meant something, and it's in the after, it's when the war ends that uh, that's this torper sits in, this fear like, oh god, what are we going to do, how are we going to square this, and Lenin's brain just killed itself, instead of dealing with this contradiction. Lenin's brain exploded so that he wouldn't have to deal with it, and then Trotsky just stood there like a fucking gomer and waited for somebody to get him out of the out of there uh and Bukararin of course got the neutralized and eventually executed and the only one who was willing to do with Lenin shrunk from was the fucking the Georgian thug the the the underworld guy the sociopath. what was it about maoism that got the peasants on board versus Leninism because it was not a uh traditional marxist movement, it was not made up of working class people, which was the bulk of the bulshevic uh support in St. Petersburg, that sort of pushed the thing off, them and the soldiers and sailors, they had the working class in these cities, the Chinese communist tried to organize the working class in the cities, but the nationalists at every turn fuck their shit up, and eventually there is a huge massacker of the communist party and their cadres uh in Shanghai, that's basically the end of the the project of trying to create a orthodox marxist movement in China, mau and those guys looked around and saw that this mass of dispossessed hokka peasantry in southern China "these people who h were generationally rural proletarians, had had no land because they were the descendants of immigrants from northern China, they have been working generationally as laborers in the countryside, they can be organized and were organized and they made up the the center of the ar, they were the heart of the army that ended up overthrowing uh the nationalists, whereas the uh the rural peasants in Russia were inert at that point, and this is down to time frame, by the time the chinese uh show up and the chinese uh, I'm sorry, um, and that's not really the case in rural Russia, there there were landless workers in rural Russia, but communal ownership of land by peasants still existed in large amounts, out Russia and small holding was the norm, but even then at the early stages of the war, of the revolution, the peasants were by and large pro Bolshevic, even though they were they voted SR when they did, they supported the revolution, they supported excorporating landlords, because the the the land policy of the Bolsheviks was the land policy of the social revolutionaries at first, but that was basic. a scan, but it why, but it wasn't a scam because guys, because Lenin, they didn't really believe in just giving the the fucking farmers the their land, they knew that that would not allow for the development that needed to happen in Russia, but they assumed again that world revolution would make this haul irrelevant, and german agricultural help would allow for them to agriculture in the countryside with minimal conflict with the peasantry, but of course that doesn't happen, what do we do now? and so by the time the second big reckoning happens in 1941, the late 30s, world war 2 capitalism divided against itself temporally and geographically between the... those who got there early, the allies, and those got there late, Germany, Italy, Japan. Germany and Italy's uh case, it's because they were not brought together as sovereign entities until much later than the other countries of Western Europe, and for uh Japan, because they were uh closed up to uh the west until the their gates were blown open by Matthew Perry and they had to industrialize basically. night, they did an amazing job of it, but they were still showing up late to the party, and that meant that the path that the allies had taken to stabilize their economic systems in their growing pains, colonialism uh was no longer possible for them because all the stuff was spoken for, all the land was spoken for. and they reacted the way that a capitalist state will with its borders to for fully constrain, it will eat itself and then lash out in a death spasm. the only government anywhere that stood for the working class as such and therefore a christian apocalyptic horizon was Russia, this country that had just uh massacred millions to build an industrial economy, did what the capitalist states had done, again they had to do it to survive as a state, but socialism in one country was the first revision, you want to talk about revisionism, socialism in one country is a big ass fucking revision. but they thought they had to do it, why? because they could not imagine them being in charge, and that is what constrains all human social movements is that they're made up of humans. eventually though, the collective effort draws us towards one another, unless we fossilize into regimes of exploitation, which i'm...' sorry, the Soviet economy was, workers did not have control over their workplaces, they did not have control over their amount of labor performed, capitalist did not take the... labor, it was not a capitalist economy, they did socialize that surplus towards building a state with a project, extend global world revolution, like i said, if you're an American in the 30s, being a communist makes sense, not believing what they say about the fucking show trials makes sense like? "this is, this is, if you want a horizon, if you want to believe that we can actually change the world and change what it means to live amongst each other, then you got to be with the Soviet Union, it's all that we had, but it was a due to failures, not success, and as a result, when that war ended, the wild dogs of capitalism had been euthanized, but the uh, but the worker state of the Soviet Union had suffered such massive damage that it was forced to uh conceed to the capitalist west and a uh the ability to create a global economic trade network and and world system that that the Soviets would participate in as subject. and in the process of fighting this war, all these huge technological innovations emerge. again, we get the technolot, we get the first industrial revolution, because of the seven years war, we get the explosion of technology in the last 50, 70, 80 years and the technological revolution from world war one, or from world war 2. and the technological regime supported by the atomic bomb, the error uh technological the one that everything else flows out of one way or the other and that secures the victory of capitalism and the reign of Satan over us all, and it's disproportionate holding in the hands of the west, that is what dooms uh, the socialist movement from that point, because capitalism then is able to defeat the national populations of all of the... subject people and underdeveloped colonial countries, peace by peace, one by one, capitalism show knocks on the door, says sorry about all that colonialism, that that's awful, uh, but you guys and you guys get to create your own economies, good, go for it, we're very. proud of you, you welcome to the family of nations, but here's the debt that you owe, here's the cost of these things, what can you pay for them with? oh, your raw resources, oh, that's funny, well we'll certainly take those off your hands, but that means that you have to essentially replicate the colonial economy that your former over... had imposed, only now you're replacing colonial administrators with your own government's bureaucrats, and turning the comparador class into a national bourgeois, and there is class conflict, but it is all, it's separated, it's it's it's it's isolated, it's it's all these uh people struggling together, but without access to those tools that had been developed in the initial struggles in Europe. they were all being horded by the capitalists and the the the uh the socialist block was behind the eight ball the whole time and always always a massive disadvantage. i mean uh Russian GDP exploded in the 50s, but that's because they had to build. that the US was just building on top of, and that means it's just a matter of time until the uh west calls in the uh debts, and that's what starts happening in the 70s, and because no... communist country is going to launch the nuke, because that would be to annihilate every reason for being they've ever had, thing that goes beneath consciousness of even the most cynical operators, nobody can fucking launch the nukes, so they step down, and we now live in the aftermath of that, but as I said, what this should free us is our enslavement to a teleology of the idea that our efforts as humans on earth don't mean anything unless they build a story of western individual humanity, not humanity as as as a species, but humanity as a specific sort of subject formed by specific regimes of accumulation over time. in our case the roman world that Christ emerged to during. Our actions have meaning no matter what happens in the future, because we are carrying them out. We're. believe in something every minute of our lives, it's just a question of what that thing is, and and the reason that there is so much endemic, social pathology, sadness, misery, self-destructed behavior is because the only thing we believe in, the only thing that we can all agree to believe in, the only belief that is rewarded in the marketplace and resonated outward is ourselves. but if we believed in other people then every moment can be clarified and and action, meaningful action can be taken, which makes all those other bigger questions irrelevant, it doesn't matter, you don't have to have a fucking carrot at the end of a stick. like I believe yeah the western individual subject is not long for this world, but that does not mean that life that that conscious life even is going to be extinguished, I don't think that's possible. I think consciousness isn't is is uh the definition of existence. that you can't that it does not exist outside of consciousness, so there is a future that we're all part of even now and we're building without knowing it. but the thing we're building is not something we can imagine, this is what i mean by we're we're in we're living in the post apocalypse and the apocalyptic uh horizon i'm talking about is one where the world as we understand it and humans as we understand them can live together and face each other as friends and as brothers and sisters and live that way that is That's the apocalyptic horizon, and that's what gives our political actions, or should give our political actions, meaning did anyway. Uh, what I'm saying is that's gone, but that does not mean anything, because what comes after will be as much us, as as what our narrow conceptions of identity would have us believe, and when that happens. this period, this i this uh, this subjectivity that we cling to, I know I do, that we cling to so terrifiedly, we'll look... like the transitional fossil that it always was, and that's fine, we're all part of the story, now how does does that mean like oh, the world's going to end? oh, absolutely not, like we're not going to get - that total anniholation that is at the end of the uh capitalist Christian teleology, the death drive if you will, that's that's not something they're afraid of, it's something they're seeking, and like anything you don't get what you want, what the what the what the cat the final catastrophic destruction fantasy is is of a collective something, a final reunion, they can, it cannot be conceived of as a conscious - restitution and uh healing, because being separated and wounded is how we now define being a person, but if we all die once or or if all of our structures collapse at once, there is at least finally a collective uh experience that we could be part of, which we're longing for, even though we deny it, yes, union through nuke, we're all we'll all go together when we go, the classic tom uh layer song. for the bomb that if the bomb that drops on you takes your friends and neighbors too, there'll be nobody left around to grieve, so that's not where they're gonna get, everyone's still going to die alone uh, in somewhere on a on a economic totem pole that leaves them feeling. at the end of their lives, uh, defeated, including the the luckiest and most powerful and most uh successful, the ones in the cocoon, but yeah, all that's gonna happen is that apocalyptic conditions that currently exist on earth that would to people who worry about the end of the world would absolutely be processed by... those people as the apocalypse, if they happened everywhere simultaneously, they'd be like, oh yeah, this is the end of the world, they will just slowly increase the territory that they occupy, and the uh, the elite and their hangers on will retreat to uh, to citadels, an archipelago of wealth, talked about this before, and just slowly shrink over time, and that means that nobody ever gets an apocalypse, nobody ever gets the ecstatic reunion of catastrophe, unless somebody does press the nuke to make it happen, if somebody is able to take that world historical weight on their shoulders to be, I am going to be the one at the end of this story, pressed the button, I'm going to be the beast, I i'm going to actually become Christ uh, and maybe that happens, I mean, but again, I don't, but the lives, the lives that are lived while this is happening, subjectively and individually, are still can be made meaningful, and deaths can have meaning, and all that meaning will come around somewhere in some form, because nothing goes. away and that's the thing like will the us use nukes rather than lose hegemoneny and that is a very very open question uh i would say at some point. It probably will happen, but I have no idea, but that's not the end either, that's only likely the end of one form of subjectivity, one way to be a conscious being, and there are many other ways, there are infinite ways to be be a human, to to have. to have a collective understanding of what that is, and there exists one that is able to harmonize that is able to utilize technology. and those guys say nope, can't do it, technology always takes over, but i look at history and there's so much contingency there that i really think that enough enough tosses of the dice bring up possibilities that we could not conceive of, because the people dealing with those situations and dealing with that technology and building that technology are doing it from a completely different. uh subjective perspective. Crab people, why not? I do think that there actually could be a human a human a future for this brand of humanity, this run, this factory run of humanity, if uh there could be a negotiated stepdown of American hegemony, although Bartamy thinks you're just delaying the inevitable there, but that does seem sort of uh, the point because it's very difficult to see the American state uh stepping down that way, all the incentives push the other direction, and as I've said before, you can just witness that the fact that you've got this casmous, massive culture war with these hugely polarized uh political structures and and a political parties that represent like these manic. mirror images of each other to their middle class voters, but they're both on the same page on the on the long-term, the most important question, how do we relate to China? they have this, they have there's basically no uh real gap there, i know that republicans love to say, oh the the the democrats love China, they want to kiss China, look at what they fucking do in power, what was Obama's big uh foreign policy push? for uh Obama did do some stuff to stand down US military commitments in the middle east, he he bitched out in Afghanistan and he uh let Hillary uh, he let Hillary lure him into Libya, but he did refuse to go into Syria even though they wanted him to, and he did hold to the withdraw from Iraq, and why did he do that stuff so that he could make an asian fucking pivot, which meant? confront and contain China diplomatically, economically and militarily. Biden right now is trying to delink American technological uh economy from China's. That's what they're actually doing. Forget about what they say, oh, they don't say China virus enough, like this is for children. They're blaming Russia now, but Russia in a long term can't really be your boogy man, one because their culture, the culture war coding doesn't work for half the country, they look like uh based white people, and also because they're just not really a threat on their own, and the big and the uh, the right-wing resistance to the Ukraine war is they they say this publicly, the anti-w voices who say stop fighting Russia, do so because they think... No, we need to to uh, we need to link up with based Putin to confront China. So, someone needs to take our fucking nukes before if they, if they're really serious about about uh, about taking the car keys from us, they also need to prevent us from just. trying to uh bluff our way into holding permanent domination because like I think at this point looking back on it the invasion of Iraq is an attempt by a uh a radical segment of the greater American uh ruling class to prevent the long-term uh migration uh away from the... because that's the thing, capitalism passes through these like national hosts the glow, but once you get fully uh, fully nationalized capitalism, then it shouldn't really have a single national headquarters anymore, and that is the natural progression, which by the turn of the century, many people in DC were very well aware of, and you had this faction of those people who thought as a tactical matter, the US should attempt to use its massive military to stop that from happening by trying to... reassert a formal colonial relationship to the most important energy sec energy uh pools in the world. i am very excited for the oppenheimer movie. it's interesting because like nolen seems like he is a full reptile, like he is an angle's anglo. all all human emotion has been drained from him, although he does like also though understand like love as this you know universal bonding thing, but he, i think he kind of his films have that reptilian feeling because he understands like what angle is and means, so it'll be interesting to see how he takes uh that moment, which really is the uh the hingepoint. so i i want to see g to see it on iimax baby yes let me see that nuke let me see the satan's eye open up i mean the fact that it happened at the fucking trinity site get out of here get out of here too much symbolism killing me here. buse yeah it's an atomic lucifer that takes over the whole world so yeah it doesn't seem now though so that failed. war on terror failed in its effort, it actually only uh exacerbated America's hegemonic decline by creating this just bucket with a hole in the bottom that didn't do anything accepted rich defense contractors, which hey that's part of it, but that's not supposed to be the whole thing, it's supposed to also uh convert American military power into economic power, which it has not done the way they wanted it to. they they reachceed their grasp, that's why it had to be a a a segment within the uh uh political, economic and and uh military types to do it, and I think it's no coincidence that they're extratskites, because they still had that uh apocalyptic, it had been inverted and twisted at this point, but they were true believer. and now an American apocalypse, and they because of uh 911, however that happened, and I am at this point, I would say I am agnostic entirely on 911, I don't know, I know that whatever they put in the fucking uh, in the report is not true, 911 commission report obviously is fiction, same way the warren report is, but that i have no idea, but that context created this attempt to extend American hegeemony by saying, okay, we're going to actually stop doing capitalism. it was great, thank you, we appreciated it, but now we're going to just do American imperium. thank you very much. now we got China who's over here actually trying to do capitalism. but they're doing it when they had used capitalism to build legitimacy in their institutions as opposed to us who had seen it hollow ours out. so we'll see, we still have all those news and Russia does too, and Russia doesn't want to get dismembered and destroyed, which is clearly the only answer that NATO and US are going to take, it's all feels very uh, tenuous, but it always is, and we still live lives that uh that means something even if we can't see it, and that we can take a good faith effort to try to find, it gets reflected somewhere, i do think that, and even if it's not true, what difference does it make, buse you're still here, might as well try, all right, think that's good, uh, next week, we're still here, uh, I had to think, but I forgot it, I'll remember. Bye-bye.
