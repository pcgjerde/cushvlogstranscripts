 hey, oh crap, are we going to get in trouble? uh, oh, hm, perhaps, i forgot about that until you did it, oh shit, well you got to stop doing that, damn, yeah, all right, well whatever, oh we'll cut that out, before we after we do this, that didn't happen, apparently twitch has - been descended upon by ria, which to me, that's that's your uh, missing the forest for the trees, if he but like where what what are you doing? where what is the the even theoretical point where you're going to squeeze some more money out of this by doing that? like oh darn it, i can't listen to somebody on uh playing Zelda listening to uh to the the chain smokers, now i don't have to buy that, i could just watch that and it replaces that experience for me, it's ridiculous, but folks, what are you going to do, you can't fight city hall. or more accurately you can't fight uh Mickey Mouse who is the avatar for the copyright regime that stands bloodyly over our destroyed cultural corps uh did you tweet about this matt? I didn't yet, thank you for reminding me, you should put it up, I will right now, I often forget so welcome to the early when I do it, when I do it myself, it has a a thing that - prompts me to show it, so I often do it that way, so I've forgotten, I'm having a bit of, okay, there we go, I shouldn't put it in that pocket, so congratulations to uh, Andre kunnan, O'Brian, for uh joining the Supreme Court, uh, with the other word worthies, with the other wise men and women, will decide this nation's future, I think it's going to be, you know what, I think it's all going to turn out great. uh, let me just write this out, rgb plus acb equals, that's right, folks, what the fuck, what's going to happen now, uh, there's a lot of ways that people are hashtag coping with the reality of this new unbreachable 63. republican essentially super majority on the supreme court uh there's basically no way that they ever that the right will ever lose a case again because every every avenue of of swing voter has been cut off like Roberts is certainly a wild card when it comes to things that he thinks are crucial to maintaining the bullshit um sense of like institutional legitimacy that he thinks the... needs to maintain uh and cavanos kind of a wild card on uh like criminal justice stuff uh you don't have to worry about anybody throwing off any kind of curve balls because you'll always have at least five to do the dirty so that's cool uh and of course everyone is very angry about the democrats just letting it happen and of course the wise smart people will tell you there was nothing they really could have done and i think that is technically true, there is no, because the senate rules can be changed by a vote of 51 at any time, and there is zero, zero chance that Mitch McConnell would have hesitated to do it, do that, which means that all they really could have done is maybe delayed it until after the election, and then hope maybe that changes the calculus, maybe cuuse it is pretty close, hypothetically, but honestly I don't even know if they could have done that uh, but the one thing we know. that they wouldn't find out, they didn't try to do it, and that's the real question that people are asking, why didn't they even try, like even if they knew it would fail, why wouldn't you try to show the seriousness of it, because the supreme court has been the thing that democrats have pointed to as a reason to get people to vote for democrats and the presidential level for my entire adult life, every every answer. to the reality of the Democrats, you know, total neoliberal character and and constant drift drifting to the right on all major economic issues is met with, yes, but the Supreme Court, and now it happened, the the red line got breached, RBG died uh, girl bossing, and they replaced her with a yonger uh, more facund and uh, uh, psychotically catholic one. the RGB so congratulations all around uh, but the question has to be if this is the right big red line and they crossed it without an effort be put up without them even trying, then how could it have been that big of a deal, and how can you expect the democrats to put up a bigger fight to anything in the future, is what the real baffling thing is, and I think the answer to why they wouldn't even put up a fight is, they don't want to show how fundamentally powerless they are, because they need to maintain this fiction for a majority of their voters that they are... crucial that they exist as a crucial stop gap for the worst uh rapine of America's reactionary uh government and and and base, but uh, also they have to fail at every specific juncture that they would count as a red line, important one, uh, without any kind of effort, like they they can't uh, how are they, they don't know how to reconcile that fact, and so what they do instead is not establish what it would be to fight at all, leave every fight to the next fight so that you never have to show your cards basically, you never have to actually say, oh, like, this is how much power we actually have, because you either see how much they've been holding back, or you see that they can't actually stop anything, and if they can't stop anything, you don't need them, and that's the... real nightmare scenario, if the extent of their full incapacity is ever expressed publicly, they lose all reason for being, so they essentially have to at every point back off from a final confrontation and convince their voters that it isn't really the final confrontation, that there's something else, well, hey, what, what was the point, jeez, this is a bummer, get vote, vote, go vote, even though Biden has said, he has no plans to do anything significant to change the court's composition, which guarantees that any major legislation that did come out of the Biden administration would end up being shot down including any attempt to remedy like the wild amount of voter suppression uh and uh and misallocation of representation in this government where you have these this fucking permanent minority that is able to exercise veto power over all social and economic uh issues. uh, we're going to vote, vote, vote, vote, you know, even though we now have said that this is going to be the way things are, that nothing we do will ever actually go through, you still have to vote, because that's the next thing, that's the next fight, and then at every point, every fight is on the terms of the democrats, meaning they determine how much effort to put in in terms of engage. the only thing stopping you from the horror happening and the horror also occurring right in front of you, how they just phase shift away from the point of crisis, because this is supposed to be it, how many people on the liberal left said, if they even try to fill that seat before the election, we will burn this motherfucker down, i mean it wasn't just Aslon, it was a bunch of people, and at that moment when it happened, they probably would have agreeed with that, but then after those hearings, after Fiinsteen after the democrats doing nothing except say some shit about keeping arrows in their quiver, it's just like cutting your veins in a warm bath, it's like, well it could, it can't, this I guess isn't the thing to burn things down about, I mean obviously it all springs from the fact that they're not serious about doing anything ever, so democrats never have to worry about a response. never have to worry that they're going to get kicked out or punished for failing to do the thing, because not doing the thing just it keeps these uh liberals in the state they want to be, which is always activated about politics and aggravated and worried about it, but at a bone deep level, not willing to do anything except virtue signal publicly and vote uh, because anything to to do otherwise would be to engage in a politics that... but undermine their social position, which they do not want to have happen, so they have this relationship with the Democratic party where they're kept in this frathing state of of crisis and the democrats have to be reinforced over and over again to the public is the only thing standing between us and oblivion and then allow the thing that we fill our minds with as the worst case to occur and then do nothing, they're by meaning it's not the worst thing, meaning there's a new fight the next day that we're going to keep having. and we're going to keep withdrawing, it's uh, it's an amazing mechanism, and I have to say, if you ask me what I think is going to happen, realistically, Nothing, I think there will be no court packing, there will be no court uh, impeachments, there's not going to be anything, they're not going to even do term limits, they're going to do what Joe Biden has promised to do, which is to form a commission, and that commission can exist as a idea, an option that could hypothetically change things uh, that we have like stuck. implementing it is is another moment where the the what's possible kicks in, because forming a commission is never going to really get any kind of real veto from the the republicans, they love a good commission, i mean they don't do them when they're in power, you ever noticed that, they don't do bipartisan commissions, they just do. things, only democrats do commissions, because it gives the illusion of action without the actual action, which means it doesn't engage conflict with the republicans that would require them to actually pursue like political change that can, allow them to fucking compete for power realistically, as opposed to play the Washington generals for the next 100 years, which is what they're on path to do. uh, so yeah, it's uh, it's a real bummer, but you know, I think the good news is just this mechanism is so deeply broken, I think that uh, that these questions are going to become obsolete, as I've said in one or two ways, like either the political has been totally foreclosed in which case, you can at least kind of relax, you know, you can stop worrying about politics, because politics are. real anymore uh in any sense, it's it's it's just been for closed as an option uh or the terrain changes so fast and so dramatically that shit like the composition of the Supreme Court uh is no longer an impediment to anything because the social uh investment of authority in those institutions has been compromised so thoroughly that they can't be enforced anymore that's going to be it and not saying that will happen or even likely to happen but it's not off the... uh and that's what i i hold in my heart when i think about how just from like the chessboard perspective the American political system is so it's it really does feel like it's a fucking 747 where the pilots have been killed and somebody has just changed the uh tiller to one side that's such dive bombing into the ground there just it seems like the the the uh the existence of the constitution overlaid on uh like late capital crisis of uh of uh profit uh and a fully polarized ideologically sorted uh two-party political system has essentially means it's like pouring uh sugar into concrete it it it it destroys it destroys any chance of that political uh uh mechanism working even at the level of just ameliorating the most dire crisis in a culture you know... which is subsidiary, of course, class rule is about maintaining profits and all that, but what maintains profits is as a viable social base for generating uh surplus, and at that, at that basic job that bourgeois democracy is supposed to do better than anything that came before it, and has a good track record in some cases, uh, is essentially zero, there's no capacity, there's no state capacity at all, because the political structure is so deeply broken. which means that whatever is going to kickstart this process is going to come from without of it and is going to uh attack it uh uh orthagonally, but once again i don't know, i don't know, i mean last time this happened in the 30s, it was it was a work, it was a labor movement, it was workers striking and uh rioting and sitting down in their workplace, uh, i don't know if the conditions obtained for something. like that to happen again, but there's certainly enough people working in enough dire circumstances, close enough to crucial nodes of production and distribution in this country that if they were organized they could fucking bring this goddamn thing to a goddamn halt, it is possible, it's just we're very far from it, but the i don't know the the the way that this political system has been just denuded of all authority beyond just the naked words of it, the way that no one really believes that any power is legitimate anymore, that there is a public, i mean i know that scares people and makes them think there's going to be a civil war, but I think it's also a necessary precondition for people to rearrange their understanding of politics, like for people who think that it's all voting and it's all elections being disenchanted from that, and for people who also think it's all voting in all elections and that voting in elections are stupid, no, it's actually something that you can contribute to and can make change in your life, in shall of course, we hope, but like take for example the prospect of Joe Biden. over this at coming continuing uh covid crisis and concomminant economic collapse like we're really going to see depression level economic activity in the next quarter or so and they're going to come into office going to leave the phillibuster going to do nothing about the Supreme Court are going to uh get onto the process of passing you know excruciating compromise bullshit in the Obama care mold piece by piece. just like like passing kidney stones uh until the failure to do anything about the underlying economic crisis and and probably not doing much about COVID honestly because come on what's on the table at this point the genie is completely out of the fucking bottle nobody knows how to put it back together that you get another uh repeat of 2010 and there's a Republican reaction that means that well now there's not even a possibility of operating. within the system as such, because even the possibility of uh passing legislation has been removed. we'll see though, because that seems so bad and it seems like it's so likely to happen that you wonder if maybe self-preservation will kick in for some of these democratic leaders, maybe they will at maybe just ambition, maybe just the fact that they want to stay elected, maybe that'll do it, but that requires people to be pissed. and that requires people to be pressuring these motherfuckers, and that requires people to be uh not at brunch, as they say, and for everybody pissed at liberals to talk about brunch, it's good, they should be a brunch, they're fucking hindering everything, they are a huge impediment, but the people who who are going to be really pissed and still pissed and not mallified by Biden's presidency, uh, are the ones you want out there in the first place, but how are we not going to become further and further estange from any expectation of redress from government when our decrepit suid in our disaster and our catastrophe are presided over by a guy who is going to preside like Lloyd Benson and hot shots part two. Chris, can we get the video that was of today? I i captain. Jamie, can you pull this up? I'm getting to roget it out right now. Jamie, can you pull this up? Here we go, this is uh, Biden being uh, ask a question, and look at this fellows, we got, we got cush with a... phone so we can both listen to the clip at the same time, here's a Biden being asked to answer a question today, oh shit, no, wait, I fucked up, I fucked up, here we go, get back to back to one thing that that is important is that um, keep in mind keep in mind on they're going to vote on uh uh barret today soon he's still going in the background okay so he says he says here's the deal the one thing you have to remember is that it's important keep in mind. so it's important to keep in mind, buse he says it again right, you got to remember, it's really important, he goes, you got to remember, it's really important to remember that she's getting uh confirmed and it's important to remember that, just a circle, a donut hole, there's no content to that, it's fillers and they're confirming her today, that guy's going to be president, and I know they're going to try to hide him as much as possible, but that's going to be hard, you know what I mean, he's going to have to give big speeches, he's going to have to give an inaugural address in January in DC, and a William Henry Harrison it, and how is, I mean he's like, Obama's just his charisma and his persona and what? he met culturally and and and racially and socially just blinded everyone to what was happening, but we're going to have just the skeleton like cuz Barack Obama is like Barack Obama is is the terminator and when his exoskeleton gets shredded away, it's Joe Biden, like that's the the exoskeleton of the politition, you know that Obama is, under the flesh that surrounded with human tissue, that that metal carapis is biden, so all of that mystification is going to be gone, which is good, not necessarily helpful, but I think better than the alternative, so you know another thing we can look for. to, at least it'll be funny, even if nothing else, holy shit, it's going to be funny, can you imagine, i'm really glad that now i get to call things up like rogan, rogan, hey dude, could you bring this up, jamie, uh, uh, oh yes, like a baby cyclo on a diet of straight kabango, first anyone get that reference? oh dang, i realized i forgot to set up with your monitor for the chat today, matt, you want me to hook you up with that real quick, what i forgot to set you up with your monitor for the chat, yeah you didn't, it's all right, you're fine, you can see anything, and pull it up real quick, did you uh, did anyone get the right answer there? uh, i i i don't i don't think so, i i was monitoring the chat, oh was that a talk about borat, that's all i'm seeing, very nice, uh, uh, the answer to that is battlefield earth, that's that what's a little quote from, i saw borat too, and i think borat 2 is a perfect example, exhibit a in any case you wanted to make that donald trump killed American comedy, i'm not saying the the board is bad or terrible, there's some good stuff in it uh, but "you know, it's not as funny, not just because there's less novelty, although that is part of it, it was not going to be as good, it would have had been a miracle for it to be as good as Borat, because it just wasn't as fresh, you know, uh, and I mean, how the hell you even fight people who do Boreat is in America at this point, but so there's good stuff in it, he was good in it, the the daughter was very good, uh, but all the stuff about Trump and politics just felt so stale, and uh and arid it's like making fun of Russia shit and then like how Trump's a horny cheeto and then going and seeing the awful supporters, the queue people and the conservatives and tricking them into being racist, it's like, I'm sorry, but in the intervening 14 years since the first bor at those people who he made fun of, got self-aware, Trump showed up, he told them that it's okay to have fun with this stuff. they're they're winking, they're they wouldn't, they it doesn't matter if they even don't know they're being filmed, in their head they're owning the libs, so what are you even proving? they're in on it, man, they are laughing with you, uh, and then the fact that it ends with literally saying vote, are you fucking kidding me, vote, hey, America is a wasteland of uh savage bigots and vapid narcissists, uh, and people who are willing to just dehumanize each other at the and and and foreigners at the drop of a hat in pursuit of uh of mere lucker and and uh some fantasy of racial purity, vote Biden, what the heck? it uh, it just feels a little, it it felt a little felt a little lib. to me and in a very like a like a genuine uh like bone deep way, like it was a project of liberal cultural analysis, it is an attempt to make sense of the Trump years through the the lens of like a a liberal of a cultural liberalism, so but parts of it were very nice. I got to say I was uh, I kind of felt like Juliani might have been set up a little bit when I saw it in the movie, I thought maybe he was tucking something in, but like I, but it's still an absurd amount of intimacy for someone he just met, uh, it's clearly someone who is used to being led into a room by a beautiful woman and then is sort of taken care of, be it you know flight attendants or hostesses or paid escorting partners, cousins? the guy married his cousin, folks, they were first cousins, amazing, uh, I want to say one other thing about about Biden uh, and Trump, I realize. after i saw this amazing picture from a rally, it was a woman in a hat shirt that said, my son died of corona and i am still voting trump, which reminded me of course of Charles Taylor's slogan when he ran for president of Liberia after being a warlord during the civil war, he killed my ma, he killed my pa, but I will vote for him, uh, and the funny thing about that is not just like, yeah, he can kill my kids, fuck that, it's that it un it uh, it admits that essential premise of Trump's defense of himself over covid is not true, he has said that he did as well as he could, and that none of the corona deaths are his fault, because it was China and Democrats that made it bad, and that he made it as good as possible, that shirt essentially says, no, Trump is responsible for all the corona deaths, he he chose to slay my sons, but that is his prerogative. because he is my abrahamic god, like Christians at this point, they worship America, which means they worship an avatar of America, which is both themselves and some external alienated version of that, which has become for many, many people, Trump, he is their God, but he is not a christian god in the sense that he is not ecumenical, he's not universal, he is tribal because they see themselves as under threat, that's a fundamental thing that defines them as a sense of... persecution, which is what will give them license within themselves to persecute in turn, all the violence that they will sign off on, police and military, borders and everything, is premised on the idea that they are in fact under threat and persecution, and that anything that they do, in protection of themselves is is uh vindicated and warranted, it's it's a pure projection of what they want to do onto others, like when Clay Higgins to defend regime of concentration camps on the border went to Aushwitz and talked about the Jews being rounded up and so that was going to happen to Suburban Louisiana white people that he represented by MS13 going to show up with cattle cars outside of a fucking uh lake puncher train that's what you have to think in order to justify doing the concentration camp shit like they have to uh feel persecuted uh and that's why they love Trump so much because Trump you know is nothing but this ball of persecution he's constantly being oh my god everyone is against him which means anything he does is is justified um and so Trump is their avatar of America he is their avatar of persecution and suffering he is their Christ but he is here with a sword he is here to to destroy the unbelievers and the infidels and the faithless uh and and that's is all the people who are outside of the communion of maga, outside of the tribe of maga. now that's the appeal of Trump to the people who really like it, i think the reason he's going to lose at the end of the day, like i'm ready to say it, i'm ready to say fuck all everyone worrying about everything and yeah we'll talk about the supreme court decision about fucking cavenol holy shit uh but i'd say right now it's going to be too big to steal and the reason is because that pitch of Trump as being the abrahamic god of of thunder and apocalypse, no more water the fire next time, cleanser of the earth, get on the ark or drown, uh, there are enough people outside of that who still might vote for Trump and maybe did last time, who are going to see that and contrast it with Biden's pitch, well Biden is pitching himself as the new testament god of Jesus incarnated here to to Embrace all. in forgiveness and suffer on their behalf, because Trump, because he's always talking about how democrats, republicans are good people too, they're good Americans too, uh, every all Americans need to come together, like just like Obama did, and he was similarly Christlike, and and and Biden's personal sacrifices and tragedies in his life and his obvious pain that he's in now, those are all are signs of the suffering that he's enduring on behalf of bringing a wounded nation together to one community. union of of common humanity, are all saved, essentially by enduring the suffering of COVID and austerity together. and even though by the end of that by his term, I think everyone's going to realize that he was a false Messiah, I think right now there are more Americans are going to be turned on by that pitch than by the idea that it is uh in fact time for the the flood to come and wash away the unbelievers, because I think a lot of them might feel like they're unbelievers at heart too, like those crucial swing voters that we talk about uh and ex and suburban uh republicans who are... maybe college educated and who find the cultural demands of being a Republican to be gosh and who don't want to find themselves on the outside of the tent when it's time to start raining fire from the sky, and I think that as a New Testament nation, we will we will embrace uh uh Jesus Biden as our savior for a minute until it's until the the threat of the final. judgement of our Abrahamhamic god Trump is gone, I'm looking at the chat here, what's going on? uh, apparently you can vote at the Barklay center, did you see that? you hear about that? Christ, I walk by the park that today people will wait to vote. Did you know that? Uh, I assume it has to be your precinct to vote there. No, no, I don't think so. I think the early voting locations are concentrated and that like they just there's a I think you get a directory and they send you or something. I don't know, but it's all in one big place. I think they're also doing. in Manhattan at like uh Madison Square Garden. Anyway, I think I might go vote there because I haven't been to the barkley center inside. I'll maybe want to see what it looks like. Oh, it's nice inside. Yeah, I haven't gone anything yet. Uh, and you know, why not? And waiting in line is fun. Not if it's too long though, fuck that. Uh, but if it's not too long, I'll probably do it. And I'll probably, as I've said, uh, write in Hillary. Because I still think that's the funniest right-in option. I was, but that could change, um, I was just trying to find that clip of Trump at one of his recent rallies, being like, no one likes me anymore, why am I even here, oh god, that's so good, I wish I want to get in that truck, I want to drive away, I want to drive away, I want to go away, oh I was so happy, I was so happy in my own life, and now I'm here, why did I do it, why, why, I never asked to be bored. uh, it's hilarious, he's emo af right now, uh, he's in his feelings, as they say, and it's pretty funny, uh, although when he said, I used to have a great life, I was so happy, he's lying, that's why he ran for president, he was miserable, everything he has ever done, has been ashes in his mouth as soon as it has been there, as soon as it touched his tongue, he is a miserable anadonic toad who has gone from one uh uh, just destructive, hateful, isolating, uh, attempt at uh like conquest and power and sadistic pleasure and had everyone of them immediately just become used to in common place and i mean the man has been strapped to the hedonic treadmill his entire life he is uh miserable and he ran for president not just despite Barack Obama because it was a different thing and he didn't even think he was going to win and then when that became a possibility hey maybe I'm going to be president I'm going to be on the news all the I'm going to be the only thing on TV. because that's all the only way i can like sooth myself for even a second like the way that the fucking return of the living dead zombies have to eat brains to keep away the death the pain of their rotting he has to continue to see himself on television and he's like great i'll be on tv all the time but what's this oh no there are parts of the media that don't like me and say bad things about me and i have to watch that too and that immediately destroyed it and it has been misery ever since the first bad review the first the first thing the thing about the goddamn size of... the fucking uh inaugural, that doomed him, he he was never going to have a second of fun as president after that, and he hasn't, except of course for when he put the uh, the metal on the dog, when he was in the big uh truck, and of course the handsome quarterback hamburger party, but those were it, and that's why, that's why he is coming to terms with losing, because he's talking himself into how at least it'll be something different. which means it might be better and then of course he'll be ex-president and it won't be better, it'll be terrible, many many french fries, i was thinking he kind of looks happy when he's doing the the trick or treat appearance. i think yeah oh god when he when he put the fucking candy on the head of the blow-up minion for some reason like what did he think that i still don't know what it was in his head i think he was trying to be funny or something i can get get this i'm going to put this on your head i'm going to put it over here all right i found this clip let's play it real quick yeah let's do it by the way nice trucks you think i could hop into one of them and drive it away, lift it, just drive the hell out of here, drive the hell out of here, just get the hell out of this, I had such a good life, my life was great, and then I said, let's do this, darling, this will be a lot of fun, this should be a lot of fun, but I'm so happy with it, because nobody has ever done so much in the first three and a half years, no administration, Trump, Trump rallies have kind of the pattern of watching stand up in a foreign language, yeah where it's like no matter... what he says, the audience responds when the laugh line is, so he's like, he's up there being like, i hate being here, i hate being here, i want to drive away, and the audience like when he gets the end of this spray just claps and laughs, like train seals, i mean he insulted the city of iri Pennsylvania the other day, to their face, he said, the thing that would have actually killed a campaign in that state anyway, the thing they would have talked about years later is a legendary gaff, oh the earfuffle, he goes, he goes, i'll tell you right now, if it hadn't been for covid, i wouldn't be here, i'll tell you that right now, i sure wouldn't be here, that's for sure, like you guys are beneath me, but of course as i said the trump fan is a worshiper of hierarchy because they believe themselves to be elevated, but in any hierarchy has to have someone above you realistically, and so like some avatar as i have said, and that guy who can buds christ and like george Washington into one figure is uh donald john trump. and then like his, that's why they see him as so authentic, even though he lies all the time, because he is saying what they are, they say, he he's what, what does he do for presidency, he doesn't actually do anything, even though he's responsible for everything because he's the abrahamic god, he has no direct control over anything, he's watching us, it's like the way God watched uh, watched the people of Israel like lose their way and you get pissed, you know and decide to smite some shit, that that was simple, watching and getting matter and matter at our failure to live up to him, but that he's watching on TV, which is what they're doing, watching television, which means that there's no way they'll ever not like him no matter what happens in the world because they don't attribute that to him, they attribute it to us, failing to live up to him. i was just thinking about uh ed Musky and how his presidential campaign was basically the connuck letter, thank you, that's a great pickup, that's a great refer, i was thinking of ed. the fucking connuck letter when he ran in 1972 one of dirt Nixon's dirty tricks teams, the guys that the ones included dudes like Roger stone sent a a fake letter to I think a newspaper claiming that they had overheard Musky refer to French Canadians as Knucks and there are a lot of french canadian abstracted families in Maine so uh it's like a sizable minority in fact uh in the 20s when the... was all over the United States, there was clan in Maine, but there were basically no black people or other minorities, so they went after French Canadians, uh, the French Canadian, the most oppressed person of North America, yeah, so and it became a huge scandal, and he had to go deny having said it, but people were mad at him, and it ended up helping contribute to his campaign, uh, being torpedoed, because the other thing was that they released some oppo about his wife, he cried, that was it right? yep, he had the connect letter and then there was the accusation about his wife uh being drunk i think or something like that she was alcoholic or that she had cursed or something i don't know and he went and he gave a speech and he famously that some people say it was just snow hitting his cheek but people said he cried and that was the end of him bye-bye and musky you're loser had a teer hit his eye defending his wife's honor out of the campaign trump goes to eeri and says you're all you all sucks you're disgusting pigs why am i here and and it yet it goes and so it goes paul le page is a native french speaker that's hilarious that's perfect that he's that much of a freaking kanuck he's that much of a frog that he's one of those like deep deep woods acadians coming out to be like hey i'm going to be gov i know that's i know that's louisiana but same origin, i'm goingna hey say, i know the kanuck isn't for uh french canadians, but that's what he called the kai, that or in the he was accused of calling him. Matt, can I read you some highlights of a Jacob Wol up? Yes, let's get some tea spilled. So this is a, I, I, you, I was thinking putting this for the show, that we were thinking about doing yesterday before we moved on to doing belway garage garage. Right after this, we're recording, we're laying that down, so that uh, but this is something somebody passed to me of Jacob Wall and Jack Burtman, their their first hearing in their federal trial about Robocop. the robo call scheme, um, which it was basically like a voter suppression version of Homer Simpson and the happy dude, yes, auto dialer, uh, so there's just like mail your vote to 6:31 evergreen terrace, 7:32, three things from this, I found really funny, blondering white right-wing activist Jack Berkman and Jacob appeared before the US district quarter in the southern district of New York Monday morning over a newly filed lawsuit on behalf of the national coalition on black civic participation. Here's the thing. made me really laugh, the suit alleges the two violated the kuoklucks clan act by sending out over 85,000 robocals to discourage back communities from voting fellas, you do not want to get accused of violating, you don't want that on stapled on your resume, oh it says here, a clan act violator, huh? yeah, well we'll keep you in mind, mr. wall, uh, the other funny thing is that uh, they ended up representing themselves, notably Friday afternoon, always a smart thing to do, What's saying is the man who represents himself has a genius for a client uh notably on Friday afternoon Woll texted the daily dot and informed this reporter uh he would be represented by New York City based lawyer that lawyer David Schwarz did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the daily adult dot in court that morning which the daily dot was present for the duo further claimed that Schwarz would represent them but at the hearing no council was present okay so I got to say something now I have talked about how much I respect Jacobl as an artist and how in all i am of his commitment to the bit, whatever it is, but i've always said that there is one possibility in the Jacob, mysterium, one thing that might explain him, and it is that he is just insanely stupid, that he is just deeply dumb, and i've always discounted that just because of how perfectly he seems to hit these notes, it just seems like a hundred thousand monkey tiptuation, like yes, you know, one of the monkeys might write Shakespeare, but what's the odd that the monkey i'm looking at is the one who wrote it, you know uh uh and so I've just always said that doesn't seem, I know Akkam's razer, but it just seems too pretty, too neat, but the fact that he did this shit that is, it looks like going to land him in perhaps federal prison, uh, that's not, I don't think anyone's that committed to a pit, I think he might actually just be a complete Moron, even though god like why would he not get mad at me when I'm screaming in his face with laughter, tears are running down my eyes and then I see him at the cadlak ranch two hours later to tell him how much i fun i had and he's just like fucking the terminator just like i'm glad you enjoyed it his eyes dead eyes like a doll's eyes maybe he just is that dumb amazing uh the judge asked whether Burkman had in his possession a list of all who are contacted by the robot call to which burkman stated i do not in my i do not comma in my possession burkman then admitted to giving the third party california company which sent out the robo calls a green light here's the other funny thingman's associate jacob wall then chimed in claiming that the robocal contents were conducted with publicly available registration information and that the robocalls were never never stated to quote stay home, so they never stayed to stay home. Nevaro, the prosecutor completed the hearing by Dave Navaro, yeah, Dave Navaro, the prosecutor, instructed everyone to livemos, completed the hearing by shutting down's woll objection, she read the transcript back to the court where the last line of the call is quote, don't beat, don't be finessed into giving your private information to the man, comma, stay, home wow see the other thing is that means Berkman's as dumb as Wall and I would are the odds there are two guys that dumb who are like able to function and you know clothe themselves of of a vassly different of like different generations like how did these two even find each other? yeah Berkman's like 55 or something and Jacob is what still 20 yeah they remind me of like the the little gangster mice and loones. one was like small and one was like big and dumb, that was very good, yeah, i wonder if this is going to impact his only fans output, well jail is a great place to get even swaller, uh, i do not believe nevaro played on under the bridge, mat, i'm sorry, damn it, he was only briefly in the chelly peppers right? yeah, only after they had to let fruciani grow for the first time, they brought in Nevaro for an album or two. was that due to heroin? yes, uh, was George Washington Chad? Yes, George Washington was a Chad. George Washington was insanely Chad. He was huge for the time. He was over, he's six feet tall, six feet tall, which meant a lot back then. Uh, he was always described as a physical specimen, strapping, powerfully built, uh, physically intimidating. Uh, he, athletic, very much so, a rider and sportsman accomplished a military man of course, uh, but he was always in kind of. ill health, he was like Jack Kennedy in that way, jack Kennedy was always the picture of vivility and you know mid-century manhood, but the dude was just racked with fucking injuries, he had the back injury, uh, he had the fucking what was it uh, the graves disease, or the adison's disease uh and his uh and just was whacked out on painkillers all the time, oh he yeah, but anyway uh, he had terrible teeth, that's true, uh, very bad teeth, very, and he was kind of miserable as but he... the he's the most, he was the quiet founding father, he was not an intellectual, unlike all the rest of them, he was the stem guy, uh, Washington was the stem lord, because he was all about practical application, he was all about buying land and making it cultivatable and all that shit, and then doing military stuff, it was all about applying knowledge, so he was like the stem lord, everybody else is a fucking humanity's nerd, he was a stem lord, and uh, incredibly repressed. just like throbbing with suppressed emotion, because he had this like weird, he was he was a guy who had come from like the middle, the whatever like kind of vestige of british, english aristocracy was left in America, he kind of came from like the middle gentry part of it and he was very acutely aware of like not being fully uh being sort of semi-rusticated compared to like the higher uh levels of even a american but certainly especially English society and he chafeed under the under the belief that you know that the colonials were seen as lesser in some ways than uh in terms of refinement and and breeding than English people than English people and it made him kind of miserable this is always just like a throbbing but I think from outside he was uh he was viewed as a chat he was also sterile or might have been sterile. he's never had a child, no kids, but I would say that he was definitely the chattest of the founders, 6 foot20 fucking killing for fun, made of radiation, I was just chuckling at somebody who just commented and simply his cock fell off, yeah, his cock fell off, and he uh, he got bled to death by his quack doctors, not the last president to be killed by incompetent medical intervention, amazingly enough. uh, I saw another one that asks uh, I think less interestingly who's the most soy president, but another one that I think is more interesting, who's the most lunchpile guy, nine to five, no flash, president, Isenhower, Isenhower, yeah, yeah, Isenhower, he uh, he did the... work, but he did not make a show of it, he did not make it about him, he was a real caretaker, uh, he was really the last president, i'd say who like transcended partisanship, you know, he was the last president, because there's a real problem in the American system that we have the head of government and head of state being the same guy, that's bad, it confusess our politics because we have this understanding of our presidents as exemplares of the nation as a whole and then also as representatives of a faction of a political faction within that country and that those there's a become psychic confusion and we end up fighting over like the the symbolic role of the president like right now I would say that Trump and Biden are almost the the argument is almost entirely at the level of like what what is America, what is the head of state as opposed to what government is going to do in the face of I don't know catastrophic climate collapse and fucking rampaging. demic and a steady worstening economic uh uh uh failure, how about that? nope, we're talking about like this, like people want to talk about how who to vote for if you want to get rid of wokeness, like like there's a fucking bill someone's going to pass to end wokeness or make wokeness more, like any of this stuff is this all happening organically with this a culture, as a response to accelerating material collapse and and the the the shredding of like the political fabric of of meaning and and like... anybody uh investing in this shit, and we have these clashing notions of the presidency, and Isenhower was the last one where that kind of made sense, because he was not really seen as embodying like a republican agenda because at that point the republicans had been so thoroughly cowed by the dominance of the new deal that they were almost a self-consciously they were in the they were in the position of the democrats are now the republicans of the 50s were like the democrats now basically uh not i mean not as bad because uh uh they had more money like they they still were you institutionally powerful and they had a lot of uh they were able to hold on to like huge chunks of the midwest and the northeast uh, but they were having to sort of tack towards the center of this like uh, this center left country around the pole of the new deal and the new deal state, and Isenhower instead of challenging that just sort of implemented it, like from a common sense perspective, that by virtue of the fact that he was presenting it, it turned these you know new deal concepts into concrete and turn it into a consensus, and and he was the last, I think president to really do that, uh, and I think one of the big reasons for that is cuuse uh, the real frisures that are going to come up during the period of economic growth, when you know, we stopped, politics was still, you know, uh, we still had political control over the economy, but it was smoothing in such a, we were getting such return on investment during that period that. "we ended up talking about culture stuff, you know, not as a distract, not as a distraction from pressing economic concerns, but from an emation of like a growing prosperity, it really was happening, like the economy was distributing gains evenly across the society, which prioritized for younger people, social issues uh, and prioritized for uh, you know, minorities, like a commitment, access to this new prosperity, and raised within." white people for example uh uh willingness to change socially because they were being uh the social order was benefiting them and then this so but then you had the people for whom that didn't apply and the crisis that emerged around things like uh civil rights uh and then Vietnam war um break that and I don't think we've had a president who really captured that sense Reagan came. kind of close after 84 uh just but that's just speaking to the hegemony of you know dominant republicanism uh but yeah i'd say but Isenhower did all that without uh without foregrounding himself during the whole during the whole uh course of his presidency the fortest consensus that's it and so who better to represent that period than the the time when you go to work in the factory and then come home to your split level then the guy who went out to the golf course every day and signed off on Allan dullas overthrowing another government and uh them doing mk ultra and shit and uh then told america hey you know how we just built this giant military industrial complex you might want to keep an eye on that bye peace uh that's a woops uh i suspected the answer to this question, but I saw somebody posted earlier and I, I guess I was wondering about it, at least what your answer would be, um, which is lol, nothing matters, but uh, what do you think of the rumors that Bernie is trying to get in at labor in the Biden administration? I mean, as I have said, the we know, there was a war in the Democratic Party, and we know the winner, the the conditions of their victory have not changed, which means the leverage of the left versus them has not changed, which means any... since his part being part of that administration will do more to camouflage it from criticism than push it in another direction. I would argue that that is the case, because I see no reason to believe that the Biden administration is not going to push austerity uh, is not going to be a nightmare for working people in this country, and that people coming to terms with that as quickly as possible is going to be the key to organizing resistance to it, Bernie doing fake work in the cabinet is uh only going to make it harder to get people to that point, I'm not saying they even will get there, but he'll make it harder, because I don't. why any where anyone is getting anything about Biden's presidency being anything other than a intensification of Obama's. Uh, one of the things that I've been finding concerning about the way that I've been seeing some of the returns in this election going and seeing some of the democratic establishment talk about it. You were posting about this in a chat the other day Matt, a breakdown of voting groups by uh income and that Trump still. maintains a highest support among the richest members of the poorest areas, yes, right? right, the local barons, but at the other hand, yes, the beautiful boaters, the beautiful boaters, but on the other hand, the democrats increasingly have the support of the richest people of the richest areas, oh yeah, the richest zip codes in America, I think are all now represented by democrats, the 10 top wealthiest zip codes in America or congressional districts are all represented by democrats and if that's your if that's your... if that's if that's if that is where your votes are now, i don't know how the hell you interrupt their progression, how you turn them into anything other than another and a party of neoliberalism, and the other thing i was i was list, i um, you, i was i was watch looking at some um breakdown of the early votes and basically seeing some some democrat democratic people talking about the white working class as always throughout this entire time has solidified as a problem to be overcome, not something to be reached out to, and even more troublingly. a small but significant shift of black and latino working class voters to republican even under Trump as being something to be overcome not fought for and it's hard for me not to imagine that one of the outcomes of this uh election is just not a further entrenchment of that the liberal party in this country is something that explicitly exists to act against the interest of the poor for the interest of the well yeah uh the people have talked about a realignment party realignment and you know people have talked about that in in terms of a some sort of socially conservative or socially liberal or socially conservative fiscally liberal like ethno nationalist party that would uh you know be take trumpism to the next level things like the people have talked about Tucker Carlson representing that maybe uh and I've talked about how I think that that's not going to happen because there's no money in the tail there's nowhere for them to actually from a position of being the republican party and being controlled by capital uh to offer anything realistically to make any play at polit at persistent you know concession for about okay you win once now what you know uh i think more likely is that you have a dealignment along race which is what we might be seeing now in which case you have changed you have pulled apart the two parties and now the divide line dividing line is no longer uh uh economic at all it's off there are no real economic issues. in the political sphere, it's purely cultural, and the two parties become the socially conservative, republican party, and the socially liberal democratic party, mean and that means that the racial, that the uh minorities who disproportionately vote democratic, because they ignore the social issues where they disagree with the democrats on, in order to vote for uh uh economic issues that they think they're getting, have now decided, well what I'm real, I might as well get the... they're going to make the same decision that a generation ago the Reagan Democrat white people did, which is if I'm not going to get any bread and butter, I might as well get some blood and thunder, and they're going to do the same calculation, and all of a sudden you're getting pulled away like huge chunks of uh working class black support to republicans because they're the party against abortion and against homosexuality, which they are as well, and same thing in the Latino and other minority communities where there are is social conservativism. but it hasn't been salient to them because they thought there's something else that's salient. now race is the problem there, you would have to have some sort of deracialization of like the white chunk uh, and that's a big question, but uh, i feel like the the if there's any movement we're seeing in polls now, it's in that direction, not anything else. oh man, we've gone an hour already. yeah, we're we're we're going to have to sign off here, yeah, we got to. record uh battle garage we're going to go to garage we're going to talk about what's going on uh in the states and the government do you have your final picks locked in yeah i mean i haven't thought about it i'm going to go for the hip but anything i say i will believe because i feel like i've internalized all the data and i feel like anything i say extemporaneously will have my full uh soul behind it with no uh no second guessing from the cheap seats well let's sign off and do that folks in the chat look forward to a bellway garage on your pop players and i would guess let's see it's 5 pm now uh six and a half hours let's see let's see if i can make that turn around go it depends how much time i want to spend making matt songs sound good but we go wrong all right uh say buye mat
