 love through the bitches and tag through the bitches on the back of my drag you love baby. in the back of my reg you love the bishes and slam. on the gritches and down on the back of my regular, let's all slam in the back of our dragulas today and talk about first two chapters of the dawn of everything by David Grabgrow, so this book promises and it's opening chapter to basically you blow your balls out of your mind, that's the basic pitch, it's like all right, and and the uh, the language of the first chapter is very much like, strap in pickle dicks, we're gonna fucking blow your mind, sort of like one of those epic Twitter threads where they're like, bo brummel is the reason that men uh only wear sweatpants, and the first chapter uh starts this process of sort of demystifying uh and disillusioning us of our fantasies of how human civilization emerges by demolishing the twin uh origin stories of human civilization uh that we uh all really uh in the conventional western political spectrum uh adopt to one degree or another which is a habsian notion of a state of nature defined by violence and conflict between people nasty british and short. and the rusowian notion of a uh period of uh divine innocence that is then tanted by uh accumulated uh technologies of civilization that alienate us and and that imprison us and uh i mean the first chapter is pretty short it's actually honestly i have to say it's really an introduction it's not a chapter, don't know why they called it chapter one, they should have called it the introduction uh, so the first real chapter that like actually starts making an argument is chapter two, wicked liberty uh, and in this chapter uh grab grow starts by making a affirmative argument that i have honestly not seen before, i'll give them credit, like this is interesting, that the enlightenment sort of uh self-consciousness, the critique of the social order that you see emerge in the early 17th century was not the product, was not the product of uh western thinkers looking inward just you know for uh uh for reasons that were endemic to Europe, his argument is that it was as the result of uh Europe fully interacting with other cultures for the first time in the form of the the uh indigenous societies that they were uh engaging with in the new world and that it was their critique, it was the um, it was the indigenous critique of European culture that led uh the enlightenment thinkers to start naval gasing about like what is liberty, where does inequality come from? and all these questions that would not have occurred to them otherwise and I have to say the evidence is not terribly you know compelling uh as presented like it's it's probably an overstated case but when a project like this I will credit it because you are doing the work of trying to dismantle uh a narrative that doesn't have any better foundations that's the important thing is that you can't really argue um that the thing that they're demolishing has more substantial uh uh foundations, so if this you know alternative notion allows you a... a in a lever uh a leverage point to undermine what you think is of a speciaus or politically harmful narrative uh i think go for it i mean at the end of the day i think what they're trying to do is with this book is not necessarily argue that uh for a actual like affirmative case for human civilization but really to just say the one that we carry around with us uh is a story and it's not a compelling, it's not a uh helpful story, it's a story that hinders us, that it's a story that uh retards our ability to think politically uh in effectively because we it reaffirms our um our sort of frozen stuck nature uh and while I don't think that that's really enough like you know I do think that one of the big uh problems with the entire anarchist project is an overemphasis on you know uh individual attitudes and ideas in in motivating people, but I'd say it's better to have that alternative than to be stuck trying to square uh an emancip emancipatory political project with the dead and I do agree, dead-end notions of Russowian or habsian humanity, but like the first thing that he that they say that really kind of raises my eyebrow is, there's an argument that um that early modern European states started adopting uh things like uh trained bureaucratic courses and uh uh and and uh unify. language uh, because of the suggestion of guys like Leibnits to follow the example of the Chinese imperial state, I would say, okay, no, that's not the case, I'm sorry, that happened because Europe was going through a process of uh, a secular process of power concentration, and that that that power concentration had those uh, forms in those developments sort of built into the program of of dynastic accumulation of power, which was being pushed by material causes, not because somebody read it, hey look what the Chinese are doing, let's do it here, so that for me is one of the things I think is going to be underlying uh divergence from their like emphasis, I would say over mine, because I'm just telling the story. too, I don't have any evidence either, really, any more than anybody else does, uh, I just have um, I just know what for me resonates more, and it is recurring to the uh, the material conditions, so and and also in doing so, uh, graver makes the claim that there is no native concept of equality in European society. uh before the encounter with uh native Americans, and I'm sorry, that is uh, pretty ridiculous. I mean, you can make a weaker case that it was not a uh, concern expressed by uh, the like literate classes, because why would they? But it was certainly a thing that existed, like uh, throughout European society. at at the level of the social, but according to graber, the Europeans start naval gazing about social order when they encounter uh uh native Americans who live in social orders that are radically uh egalitarian uh in the sense that there is no central authority. nobody is really under anybody's sway, except of course for those uh bands that have uh war captive slaves, which you know that's uh, that's a real thing that he kind of glosses over uh, but for the most part you had these uh tribal social orders that did practice horticulture, so did do the thing that... later Europeans would insist leads directly to regimes of control and and uh and coersion uh but but did not have those because uh they did not have the conception of of property as uh as not just something that could be held, but something that could uh give one person power over somebody else. um, and they saw the Europeans coming to the United States and Canada and said, you are slaves, all of you are slaves to somebody else, none of you actually have the freedom that we do, and uh, according to uh... Grab grow, uh, uh, it was an interaction with a uh native American uh diplomat who whose conversations with a colonial French administrator led to the publication of a very popular book uh that was read by all of the leading philosophes and that ended up uh sparking a chain reaction of uh searching tredises and essays to try to make sense of okay wait a minute what's going on here these guys they're owning us what the these savages what's going on? and uh they point out that for a lot of Europeans, specifically for the jesuits, uh, the liberty that the uh natives prized was actually uh poisonous, was bad, freedom is not good for people uh. And that is, I think because they came from a society where social orders were so ingrained and and a regimes of uh uh exploitation and social alienation or so deeply ingrained that uh that the idea of a transcendent supernatural authority uh who who could be obey. and biopying would keep you on the right side of the authority on earth and also reward you in the hereafter uh is a necessary way to to cope that that you need that in your mind to compensate for the lack of freedom that you have and it turns that lack of freedom into a virtue but of course if you live in a social order where there is not that radical alienation between people where you are forced to treat people not as uh fellow recognizable humans like on an equal basis but as uh through the social requirements of the the class and structures that they and you find yourself in uh freedom can only be a danger, it can only be - sin, because those structures are the only thing keeping you from expressing the pain of that loneliness. so uh here we have uh a definition of equality as it was understood uh by the native Americans and how it contrasts with European notions I thought was pretty interesting. Equality here is a direct extension of freedom. Indeed, it's is its expression. It also has almost nothing in common. with the more familiar eurasian notion of equality before the law, which is ultimately equality before the sovereign, that is, once again equality in common subjugation, and also they go, they later on the they point out that European notions of freedom are tied to, are really tied functionally to roman ideas of freedom, where freedom was freedom uh too. Lord and own other people, be they your slaves or your family, and that that was freedom, as conceived by the imperial Roman state. and which uh that structure maintained itself through uh the successor regimes uh that populated Europe afterwards some says just i caught this here, but isn't anarchism the basically the end state of marxist analysis? yeah, but end states are meaningless, who gives a shit about N states? no one, none of... us are going to see an end state of anything, i would argue nobody will ever see an end state of anything, the struggle for it is life, and so the question of how do you struggle for it is the only meaningful question, and i would say that anarchism fails the question of of practical uh uh action, because it sacrifices practical action on a you'. horizon that is irrelevant to the lives of us, our children, our children's children, but i guess that's part of what grabrow are trying to do here is are you know we are not actually prisoners of history, we can change and and challenge our structures at our will, and i am very skeptical of that claim, which is one of the reasons i wanted to read this book. so this book that takes Europe by storm is this purported uh interview between this uh Huron statesman candiaron candiyaronk candiaronk candy arank I'm going to candiaronk uh and this frog uh uh and many people have claimed historically that this is just a guy talking to himself and that the native American here is just a prop uh but grab grow makes a pretty compelling argument that these guys did have close contact when uh lahon was a uh french colonial administrator in canada so and that there were notes of their interviews and the guy who he talked who had puts word in his mouth is was a real guy who might very well could have come to uh france as part of a diplomatic mission and so within this book you see Kandrunk just demolishing all of these notions uh that undergird European social order uh this is one that I thought was uh particularly compelling uh you have observed that we lack judges what is the reason for that? well we never bring lawsuits against one another and why do we never bring lawsuits? because we made a decision either to accept or make use of money, and why do we refuse to allow money into our communities? the reason is this, we are determined not to have laws, because since the world was a world, our ancestors have been able to live contentedly without them. now he gets here to the very crucial reality that it is a private property regime that necessitates the coersive state apparatus that we live within. um, and that if you do not have a state, if you don't do not have proper private property, you actually can live statelessly, but again, my mind always comes to material conditions here, and the material conditions of the tribal bans of North America uh are such that the prospect of being dominated, and completely. are relatively low in that context, thanks to the incredible abundance of resources, which is not the European experience at all, Europe has been since the fall of the Roman empire a grasp over relatively sparse territory by a lot of people, and more specific. a lot of people who thanks to the existence of the Roman empire had access to uh technology of coersion and control and and empowerment that uh uh that made uh the threat of external domination much more uh keen than they might have been in the uh north woods of the United States so again here we have a materialist difference between the actual uh environments of the one and the other, not necessarily one group making a choice to live freely and another uh making a choice to live as slaves, but but responding to material conditions differently, and at one point though, the one that really struck out to me is uh, this line which does really anticipate the marxist critique of of civilized society, over and over i have set forth equalities that we wendet believe ouught to define humanity, wisdom, reason, equity, etc. and demonstrated that the ex of separate material interests knocks all of these on the head, a man motivated by interest cannot be a man of reason, and that to me is uh, yeah, that's that's a bingo right there, that and and I must say though, that was also the analysis of Gerard Winstanley, the leader of the diggers at the end of the English civil war, wrote a book. oh my god people actually want me to read the anarchist faq shut the fuck up you really god no do you like hockey fans uh-uh no if you really watch the game have you ever really read the FAQ read the fucking FAQ obviously give me a break. so uh this book sparks this uh this this spirit of internal criticism in Europe uh and you have first this guy uh this guy a RJ Turgo who uh takes the indigenous critique turns it on his head and says yes uh the Indians don't have uh laws and and regimes of control but they also do not have uh they do not have progress, they do not have a social teleology, and that becomes one of the fundamental elements of the like western gaz as it accelerates is imperial domination of the rest of the world, like again and again western cultures will encounter these, these societies that are in a relatively homeostatic relationship with their environment, uh physically uh less healthy, whose lives are about as long, uh, who do not suffer from all of the the the manifold and horrifying alienations of uh of civilization uh, but they do not accrew, and that is, it's that lack of accruel uh that renders them fit for domination, and and in fact necessitates their domination, because uh, because western civilization, technological civilization is a project is a self-conscious project, and by that virtue, one of the virtues of imagining yourself as part of a uh social civilizational project is that the suffering within it, the suffering caused by it, of course because it's not happening to you, uh, or if it is, if you are suffering you are also gaining uh can be understood as a necessary sacrifice for this greater project that you're part of the actual pain gets abstracted away which is much harder to do when you are living life uh in a uh harmony is obviously kind of a a cliche and definitely uh kind of uh uh condescending, but certainly a more stable relationship to your environment. But a stable relationship to the environment is just that, it's stable. It does not change with time, and it is change with time that defines civilization. Uh, but where this chapter. really hits gear and where it's really interesting is when he starts talking about, so russeau took to took to the challenge posed by the the indigenous critic. and set about trying to figure out how we went from there to here, how we got from this idol to this brutal world of of of exploitation, man born free everywhere is in chains. so they start off talking about uh Cruz's notion of the state of innocence, which even russeau admitted was not an a claim of a real historical fact, but was a thought experiment, which puts I think this whole book in a that tradition, and I think that's self-conscious on Grab Grow's part. Uh, but there is one part where they're describing his notion of the uh the isolated and free individual in nature uh where I feel like... if they're being obtuse or they're not, I'm missing something, but they say that Russoau argues rather confusingly that the first humans were essentially good, but nonetheless systematically avoided one another for fear of violence. I don't think that's really confusing. I don't think there's any reason to assume that the inherent good intention of an individual in a state of nature where others are strangers, means that you will necessarily have an awareness of the good intentions of others. like it is that it's that casm that defines the other in the first place is that we cannot know them the way we know ourselves so in Rosseau's notion uh the individual free person in order to protect themselves flee towards what they think is safety but was actually slavery, agriculture, civilizational hierarchies and all that. and grabrol do a good point of pointing out that like what Rouse really did here in his uh analysis is that he synthesized the uh indigenous critique for a literate, intelligent European audience in a way that allowed them to recognize the essential truth of the critique which any real rational person and these guys all pride themselves on how realistic and rational and undogmatic they were, has to recognize is true, but at the same time cannot be accepted because they're in Europe, they're European guys, they're uh guys and gals i guess some of those ladies in the salons uh they benefit mostly if they're reading this shit, they benefit from uh the society of orders. and from colonial exploitation, they don't really want to live in the woods, so what rose does is he is the father of the of modern western liberal subjectivity where you are able to enact and enshring your own personal virtue by recognizing and acknowledging the evils of the society you live under, well denying that there's any alternative, because this is the... the notion of liberty that he cherishes is of individual autonomy, but of course that is not the liberty that any indigenous society has ever enjoyed, it is interconnectivity, mutual aid to use the anarchist buzz word, and just just interdependency that allows for freedom, it's the fact that you have. that you can rely on that allow you to be free, because yes, if you have no one else you can rely on, you will invariably have to fight, and that will rob you of freedom because it'll put you uh, away from, choices made by what, wim or fancy, and on choices demanded by the necessity of survival, which is of course not freedom. but because of that reso cannot imagine really conceive of uh indigenous societies as they are, which means that this loss of freedom is a tragic inevitability, because we cannot be interdependent that way, we we cannot uh uh surrender our uh, our independence to one another. because I would argue Russeau grew up in fucking Europe around Europeans, people whose entire lives have been uh... bined by these hypocritical structures of power that rendered them hypocrites, and so a young and and and tender, fled from his family, because he didn't want to be under their thumb, and has always fleeing towards total independence from others was doing so because the the the civilizational notions of the people he surrounded himself with were repelling to him, which as well they should have been, but that blinded him the to the even possibility. French revolution and and uh communism and all that, and as is usually the case, they they are mad at an idea when it's not the ideas fault, but it is very true that Russeau's, the implications of Russeau are that the only way to get back to that state of uh freedom, that that state of liberty of the individual, is some purifying regime that liter. changes people, and that that's i think why the rain of Robesper is, I think rightly, considered the culmination of the Russowian project, not going to do anything about emerging capitalism, not going to do anything about a society stratified by class where your freedom of freedom is totally constrained by your access to artificially restrained resource. where you you cannot get what you cannot have what you don't have to buy uh that's all that's that can't go anywhere and i mean you could argue it couldn't have at that point you know it was a bourgeois revolution at a time when the the uh capital accumulation and not become sufficient to allow for a real effective uh transfer to anything like a working class cuuse there wasn't really a self-conscious working class of any kind to take power in any case, but you had this bourgeois revolution that was trying to reintroduce liberty, equality and fraternity in a structure of emerging capitalism, and the only way to do that is to impose virtue. by force. And Rouse, Rouse's ideas, liberal, left, romantic, angelic leftism is a continuation of Christian notions of morality, where you replace original sin. with um the material economic original sin, the secular original sin of uh agriculture and civilization uh, but maintaining the notion of an inherently fallen uh man who cannot return to that state of grace, and and the... the the line that grabrow have here that I think really nails it is, we argue that in folding together the indigenous critique and the doctrine of progress originally developed to counter it, russeau did in fact write the founding document of the left as an intellectual project, because like uh to go, Russeau takes for granted the notion of civilization as a teleological project, which requires it to advance over time, which requires it to uh use... technology to increase productivity to increase uh civilizational markers to to increase the human footprint on the land to literally reshape the earth in human image in a way that indigenous society, yes they farmed, yes they built uh buildings and stuff, but not with the singular uh, like structuring drive of western civilization. uh and he ends talking about how the uh the myth of the uh noble savage was actually a right-wing uh denigration of the Russowian tradition uh and that then there became the uh idea of a stupid savage which once again comes from the fact that if your society is not building money. to itself on the land and and instrumentalizing humans to do it, then you are not actually uh a thinking social organism, because you're not moving forward, but the intriguing notion that they propose, coming off of the uh observations of french. opopologist Pierre Claster uh and I think that's going to be talked about more in future chapters which I'm looking forward to uh is that the reason that there might have been these uh these like well established igolitarian structures that were not in the process of like moving through the stages towards uh hierarchical civil hierarchical civilization is because the people of uh that were encountering the uh French and american uh colonis at that point very well might have come out of previously experience with those very social orders uh they say here we find it difficult to picture we find it difficult to picture what a truly free society might be like right which is why we find ourselves just butting against our buttting our heads together and stammering and being like what the fuck when we try to actually articulate um uh alternatives to the life that we all live because we've never experienced it, we we have no real understanding of it, which is why talking about end states of of socialism is so absurd, that would the end state of socialism, such that it even could be imagined to exist rather than to be a horizon, would be shaped by the specific contours of the struggle to attain it, cannot be conceived of without that experience, but that means that we're stuck. unable to move forward a lot of times for lack of a a vision uh, but they say, so we find it difficult to picture what a truly free society would look like, perhaps they, the indigenous north Americans, have no similar trouble picturing what arbitrary and arbitrary power and dominion would be like, so the idea here is that they might have been able to maintain their non-hierarchical social order. for because of generational experience in the past of it and there's going to be talk about uh a uh theorized Mississippi uh valley civilization that had all of the bells and whistles of an agricultural empire that collapsed uh and that's how people flee from it and define their culture in opposition to it uh and I'm very interested to get to that stuff so that's the first two chapters, i think for next week, see how long the third chapter is here, i think i want to give it, yeah, i want to give it its time, so i think we'll just do one chapter for next week, chapter three, unfreezing the ice age, i'll pop off here in a minute, i know it's a short one, but uh, any questions before i go, Do I enjoy it? Uh, it's it's very fun read, I mean they have a very, I mean, I mean, I read Det, you know, Graber and Wengro, they have very accessible conversational style, it's fun to read, I'm I'm I'm, I and it's even fun when they like just decide to like lay one out there. be like, hey, how do we you know that that's not why they did it? and I appreciate the uh, sort of lamp shading, the speculative nature of the project. so so right now is i i think the closest thing i'd say to a thesis is is that uh alternative social forms to hierarchical uh indust technological civilization coexisted with uh industrial or technological civilization and that uh encounters between the two sort of uh sparked the building of narratives of historical uh progress that justified one way or the other. uh the current uh system because as I said Rouse is still at the end of the day as much as he wails and nashes his teeth about all the the chains that were held in is excusing and justifying where we are as this tragic but necessary inevitable I would say rather than necessary uh uh seeding of liberty as individual atomized people uh flee from uh the fear of one another into chains uh and that and hobs kind of become the poles of uh imaginative uh history uh in the west, an aliby as it were for the crimes of civilization uh and we'll see, we'll see how they pull it off, there's a guy who keeps dming me to insist that this book annihilates the notion of stages, so uh uh stages of uh of uh economic and social development and you know I'm open we'll see but yeah I'm enjoying it uh just yeah last question here uh uh the legacy of roman. impact on our political imagination, i i referenced it briefly, but yeah, i really do think that we live in the shadow of, i mean in the way Philipk really was right that the Roman empire never fell, and that it is the uh political imaginary of the roman imperial state that we have inherited, it never has been really challenged and overthrown from within, like notions of like freedom and liberty are: tied not to interdependence the way they would be in in other social orders, but to explicit ownership and domination, and those models, as I said, became the basis for the successor states of feudal Europe and then inscribed themselves uh in capitalism, capitalism really took that domination and abstracted it, was able to use the use technology more. than anything use technology to abstract away the personal violence of uh regimes of ownership that go back to Romans and then uh put them into the air made them made them the air we breathe so yeah think about think about those romans i that's why i always kind of wish that uh that david as much as i love deadwood i kind of wish that uh david milch has got to do his uh idea that he originally pitched to HBO because what he wanted to do is he wanted to do a show about the birth of social order out of relative chaos and so he wanted to do a basically a cop show about ancient rome like not like not even like late republic like early republican Rome when they didn't actually have codified laws but they did have something like police forces so you had these guys basically making up law as they as they did went about their job uh and they were making rome at the time so they said no and then because Rome was so expensive they ended up not doing the third season or the fourth season of uh deadwood so I know people like Rome but I only watched the first season got stopped caring when Caesar died and I really hold a grudge against it because it prevented us on both ends from the ideal uh David Milch experience. Okay, so yes, next week, chapter three, but bye.
