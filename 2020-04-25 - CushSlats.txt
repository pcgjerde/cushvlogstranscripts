 Good evening Mr. and Mrs. America and all your ships at sea. Let's go to press. uh, today uh, instead of coming from the bunker, I come from the beautiful, gorgeous uh, spring day here in uh Brooklyn, New York, uh, is, apparently it's the only nice day we're going to have, tomorrow's going to be rainy again, so I want to get out here, well the sun was still out, enjoy some of this beautiful nature, look at all this stuff happening around. trees and billowing bushes and such, and there's dang cheeto in the white house, there's a goddamn cheeto in the white house, there's a worldwide pandemic, economic collapse on a on a on a way that like the post uh, like the post Kansian economy, world economy has never had to deal with. Kim and jong on might be dead and there's a goddamn cheeto in the white house, how the hell are you supposed to make sense of it? how how do you make sense of it ed tom? it's goddamn beyond everything, it's goddamn about everything that time, isn't the one thing, it's a dismal tide, not the one thing, not the one thing. the evening redness of the west, how you guys doing? uh, someone says fuck me for streaming right now, why would i want to stream any other time? look at this, the sun is literally in my face for god sake i don't know how much longer that's gonna last uh, i hate edibles because you can never guarantee what you're gonna get or like how long it's gonna last, i hate all that, edibles are for like when you go into a movie or something and you need and you you have to you know. you're going to be out of the house, like edibles i don't understand the plant of edibles in quarantine, i guess like to get surprised by yourself, like oh shit, i'm way higher than i thought i was, i guess i don't know, i've only been smoking, but i'm i also have other things other than uh, other than acid or i'm sorry, other than uh other than weed that might be contributing, i'm trying to like trying to crossfit. I guess she caught, I got to say, um, I drinking a lot less than I used to, like alcohol, so you know, if something's got to give, I'd rather it be boos, my, I don't have micronosing zord, ah. how you guys doing man uh how you guys living in this year of the cheeto? adding animo chitone, would that be it? ano chitone, ac? the year of the cheeto, the year of the freelay cheeto product, like we're in a goddamn david Foster Wallis book, and the thing is is that you may make fun of wallis all you want. but he got it, he knew it was coming more than anyone, he knew it was coming, he saw it, the year the the subsidized time, i mean there's no figure in like pre, like especially right around the turn of the millennium, there's no figure in uh science fiction or literary um uh uh fiction that heralded trump more thanny gentle famous cruner the uh the non partisan uh president of the ownen confederation uh that would rule near future America in infinite jest, the thing about like people hating Daviderales basically happened because like guys guys have there's there's i hate the sound too redpill here but this is just the fact is that like you know there are certain uh strategies for uh attracting women that certain men adopt and ones who aren't physically capable of doing so uh use uh uh use the the use um use their their their wiring their their wits and what have you, the fuck basically what i'm saying is that you you you goof on the the jocks with like the art girls, but eventually the jocks aren't there anymore, it's just you and the art girls in Brooklyn, so now what do you do, like you know, none of you know how to play football, uh, none, none of you uh, none of you can change. so who's who's the jock? who's the scary masculine guy that you can convince the more anxious of your female uh friends that you're not like well he beats David Foster Walis gets pretty sad like they're really that's like uh like when when when they're going after when when they're making it being bro like to read a book that a 1500 page book then those terms have been destroyed of meaning. those those terms don't mean anything, if if reading a 1500 page book makes you a fucking a bro, then there isn't a the bro doesn't mean anything, it's a totally relative term that's just used as a way to distinguish yourself, anyway infinite jest, he got what was coming, he got what uh the he got like the psychological interiority. that late capitalism produced better than anybody in my opinion and you might say well that's because you're a white male and it's like yeah probably because he was too and that's part of the reality of it like the part of the part of that like maddening generalizable but then also so like neurotically and and and and specifically individuated so that like i can think it's my totally my own and also feel it's universal uh because that's the way that that's that's relate that uh reflects the same uh uh facets of capitalism, it's malliability and customizability, so that state of mind i think he gets that better than anyone, but of course it's filtered through the mind of a white male dude bro, so white male dude brows read it and they get that i think more readily because they have fewer, they don't have to translate it, it's it's straight, it's like reading something in its original language as opposed to a translation or having to do translation of yourself from the second line, like that's the difference, yeah, i think that is it, so yeah, so uh, dfw stands for dudes fucking winning, now he wasn't genius about everything, i like the fact that he wrote like that mathematics book and like all mathematics say no, he was a moron, he had no idea what he was talking about, but because it's mathematics and like that's the kind of thing that buse that's the thing that made him a genius too. these cuz like the thing about people like me is at the end of the day and I think this is almost universally true gun of the head people like me who like maybe know a little bit about history maybe have a little bit of a ability to like synthesize concepts maybe they can recall ideas maybe they can you know be maybe they can bring a bit of insight into a text uh that maybe you couldn't if you were reading it uh we all think and if there's anybody who is who thinks that they're like me in this and disagrees you can fucking take it up with me because i won't i mean i don't if i'll ever believe you, i'll think you're like uh who doesn't think that like hard science uh intelligence people with that are like smarter than they are uh and so the fact that he was this you know consumment uh indoor theater kid but also kind of a jock a little bit and then also scientist a real smart person come on that's he's literally like creating himself as like the the the ideal version of the like the late American male that synthesizes everything that came before like the dialectical uh uh embodiment of the late American white male like that's what he was and that mathematic but the thing is what i'm saying but the joke of that is that he wasn't actually very good at mathematics according to actual mathematicians and i have no way of judging what they say but people who are some math say no, his bath math is terrible uh, and that like all of his books on hard math are riddled with errors that like that are very basic uh and i just like that's another thing like the paddock shooting i don't know if that's true and i never will cuz i don't know how to count, i can't count on my finger, you need my fingers to count, i'm not kidding, like i literally i got no, i won't say that, but i'm i'm basically can't do math, like beyond what's asked of my fingers, so i have no idea if he know what he was talking about, but people who know what they're talking about say he does didn't know what he was talking about. anyway, but that's why he was like he was the he was the full spectrum he was the embodied man you know he was the man in full hilariously like uh it's kind of funny that um that Tom Wolf wrote a book in that exact same time period that's about the same phenomenon that he called a man in full but because of course he was writing it from the perspective of the fucking boomers uh it didn't capture it because you know he couldn't translate the moment but you could have called him that like a... biography of him could have been called that instead of whatever the hell what the name of that biography of him ended up being called like a ghost story is a love story or whatever the fuck no people were talking smack about me and the tom pinchin subredit what what cuuse I read it cuuse I read against the day I only said good things about Pinton I don't understand why they'. me and i have not claimed a knowledge about pension that is above my station, which is i'm sure what they really get mad about, is anybody referencing pension doesn't understand at the level they do, which of course you know that's up for them to decide, i would never make that claim, but uh, i don't know, so i never said anything bad about pinching, and i was and i read a part of a against the day, which is like an underread pinched book i kind of think that i think is really good and like just a good piece of writing, so what what, what i what did i, how did i offend the pinchion people or if someone would ask me, i'm just curious, i mean i don't really care, they're fucking the same, you know, it's basically like why is why are the ml's mad at me or whatever the fuck, why why are the anarcho communists mad at me, it's like it's all the same thing, it's like being in the pinch and subredit, it's all just it's all just book clubs, they don't like me, well fuck them, suck my dick, that's my answer, you can read, you can read or you can watch this fucking live stream, which one are you doing? which one of you motherfuckers is reading uh gravity rainbow right now instead of watching me? the answer is zero, and that's true even though there's a goddamn cheeto in the white house, they don't like how i get twisted, well i mean some people can't handle the twistedness, i think john collins, my friend john collins is the person i trust most. to tell me what pinching means he seems like he vibes it and uh and corps and orbit on twitter of course him too those are my uh and b and uh yeah those guys are my consul areas on on pinching oh no not the not the fast not the pipeline guys yeah why haven't you talked enough about the uh the chapo to uh the chapo to uh pinchin pipeline buse that's got to be a thing right at least one person has had has felt like they were required i know I know I literally from being on the show the only reason I've ever read Dune, I know dune is not as good as anything by pinchion by a million years, but it's almost as hard to read as pinction is because of how like just clunky and and poorly put together it is as prose, but I read the fucking thing because I was sick of not getting the references that him and Will were making. Felix and uh Will kept just talking about shouldn't shut the fuck up about like Duke and Trayaties and the sleeper being awakening, I'm like all right, this is what the fuck is going on, like I only knew from. that awful fucking david linch movie that didn't even make sense, so i read the whole fucking book, the only the first one, i'm not going to read the rest of them, i'll just go to the wikipedia summaries from that one, prose was so slogging, but what i'm saying is literally just being on the show made me read that awful book, so i got to believe at least one person has read pension because they've uh listened to the show, which means that there is a, if someone would say that, if i could get one person to say, yeah, i uh, i wanted to get a reference or something or someone made a recommendation so i read a pension book, "if someone says that and they could like, even if you just had like a screenshot of a pension book, um, that would be more of a real real pipeline than the chapo to fash pipeline, which these people imagine exists and have never shown example, I don't want to, I don't want to dig this back up again because I mean obviously this was not a close contest, this was a destruction, there's no need to uh be uh ungentlemanly about it, but um, it is funny that if I had to, I would, it would have. I would have an easier time making a empirical argument for the existence of a chap, there's certainly a chapo to doone pipeline, but that's uh sort of obvious and easy because like I said, you can just read the wikipedia pages, oh shit, I shouldn't have done that, oh boy, How you guys doing? All right, this is an interesting one, if you could go back in time and kill any one person, who would they be? I mean, you can't just say who, obviously, because you have to say when, I mean, we just talked about uh, assassin 33 for that very reason, killing Hitler, or killing. baby Jesus is way different than killing Jesus on the cross, it's way different than killing Jesus uh in uh the garden, um, so the question is when and who? uh, I don't know, it's hard to imagine any one person affecting anything enough to be manningful, so it has to matter to you, like not in the long deray, right? because the fact is it's like if you'... go by the long deray nobody's individual uh preference for any one uh outcome over another should be privileged because how could it stack up in the weight of time? it has to be privileged by its present situation by the acuteness of it as a sensation right? like that's it, you know, that's that's that's a that's a utilitarian observation that can't be denied. i mean, i i understand that you can have like a religious uh uh disinclination to believe that. now if you believe in ancestor worship or whatever, but the reality is is that present feelings, emotions are more uh real to us than, both abstracted away from us in person and in time, so I don't know, I can't, it's hard to so it would have be, well basically this is my way of saying, it would have to be somebody in my very near timeline, because on the long, could you really ask in the long stretch, if you really pulled back pulled back... examine this moment in history, the way that we most of us who aren't like uh very specific historians of specific moments, the way we regard history with the same sweep, the way that we view like say something, the way that what we frait with the words the ottoman empire or the Roman empire for that matter, how much time that word, that that that phrase in our head what that means, the amount of time and space, the amount of human lives that that encompasses. and then in that mental little nugget, imagine we're in that same nugget for someone else, thinking about like you know who stopped Hitler from taking power or didn't stop Hitler or uh uh the battle of Tours or uh if only uh Hitler had been killed or whatever the fuck like any of it would matter in the long scheme, no because those things are determined by forces beyond any of our individual. the long duray, periods are in our mind, you create pyramids out of chaos, the long duray is the only reality, or the only thing close, it's the white whale, it's it's it's recognition of the other, that's it, that's the only reality, that's the only real thing, and that's the thing that haunts all of our moments on earth. and that's what's represented by the Pacific Ocean by Moby Dick by Judge Holden, it's the recognition of the other, it's the only real thing, everything else is just intellectualizing around that, just building sediment around it. Oh boy, how you guys doing? see what's going on? I don't know if I'm being very helpful today. Oh man, these questions are so interesting because they go from such a fucking gammet from like. very specific smallboard political questions to shit like you know questions of essential nature and like like the questions that ask you deeply to reckon with who you are and then shit like oh do you think Biden's gonna follow through on his medicare uh uh pledge or whatever the fuck oh boy there's a goddamn cheeto. in the white house, how are you supposed to deal with that? there's a goddamn cheeto guys, why there was so many serial killers in the 70s? that is really the interesting question, isn't it? and what it is is? why were there serial killers in the 1980 or in the 1890s? why were there serial killers in the victoria era? this hinge points, it's where the it's where uh the uh the hinges start moving, things start rubbing against each other, things start popping off like bits of uh accumulated calcium uh rust, see people assuming trump's going to win uh... hilarious to me, he could absolutely lose, in fact at this point i would put money on him losing, i mean i wouldn't put a lot of money on it and i probably wouldn't get very good odds, but i put money on him losing, i don't know, maybe i get good odds depending on how convinced people are that because of how obviously terrible biden is that trump must get reelected, it's like i mean if this hadn't happened and we were still cruising and like you know the fed was still weekend burneezing the american economy uh across the finish line which would want to do, you know, it's it's like having Trump as president, it doesn't really see any, why change horses in midstream from the point of view of capital, that means that all the like the the right levelers have been held and like you don't have to worry that they're going to pull the rug out from you the way that the fed did against poor Richard Nixon in uh 1960, I mean you could say like the approximate reason Nixon lost in 60 is because the Fed refused to do short-term uh uh interest rate shit uh to stop the uh 1958 uh... uh 50 58-59 recession uh and he always that was one of the other one of the eastern establishments that conspired against him with their boy with their pretty boy uh jfk and that's why he was so free when he was in office to do whatever it took to fucking cook the books and was willing to go off the fucking gold standard for once in all and end the bretton wind system and float the currency. but anyway what i'm saying is is that those same fed forces that have that that that have been keeping things going they they be fine with trump being president and so uh you know uh uh uh the Joe Biden we have sex predator uh senile monster uh living mummy corrupt uh dracula uh he would uh lose but this is an unprecedented situation and the people blame this motherfucker for what's happened and with him going out public and telling people to inject fucking bleach into their bodies, it's like you can say whatever you want about what he actually said, you can say whatever you want about the media and how they are out to get him, which is true, but I'm sorry, you watch the video of that, and that is what is enditing, and I think that's one of the reasons that this actually punched, I don't agree with Paul Crugman that this is the moment people turn around, shut up, he's an idiot, but what I think buse, what his followers think of him, is I think beyond the can of anybody in New York, and like presuming to say anything is is fraugulent. um, but what they can say, I think because they're they're they're easy, they can understand Trump, like a lot of these east coast people, I think the reason that they fuck up in talking about Trump and understanding Trump is because they second guess themselves, because they get Trump because they he's one of them, but then the fact that he has all these regular Americans who they don't understand and are scared of, but on his side it makes them second guess themselves and then they start like oh i don't know i don't know is he really what do you think no he is it's just because of the fucking idiot literal idiot box we put in front of people for fucking 20 hours a day the brains have been turned into fucking a velveta you know it's it's that's it you don't have to like try to send guess yourself but anyway what that means is that uh is that you can see in his face when he goes out there and says yeah put inject the chlory put the bleach under your skin and then has to come out and say no I was kidding. now he's now they're saying he's going to not do the uh he was loving those things every day getting the beebob and scat that's his whole milieu that's the only thing he likes about being president is the camera's on him and riffing uh everything else sucks and he hates it being meetings and signing things he hates but but be having the cameras on and him talking and for especially crowd roobes lick lapping it all up he loves that and in a room he can't do that anymore he can't get like he can't get the crowds to give him back his mana so it's just this roomful of east coast you know rootless cosmopolitans just giving him the old uh given him the same jondist eye they would have given him at uh you know across the table across the uh the the the across the floor uh uh at sarties or whatever the fuck or like at a at the vanity fair party they would give him the same like uh but because he's got those guys with him it's like i don't know it's like the fucking hell's angel showed up but anyway this is all to say, people might start blaming him for this, if his only response is, drink bleach, then people are going to be like, even the mumra man, even the the... the fucking the mummy man, the the rape mummy man, at least he's got a party behind him that maybe will have more of an idea of what to do than the people who just let this asshole go on tv for four hours a day and say maybe drink bleach, so that's why i say anybody says trump's going to win, i think they're they've kind of allowed him to hypnotize them a little bit uh, but i mean it doesn't mean they're going to lose either, the people who obviously that that we assume, i'm saying going the other way is also incorrect, how can you say this election is going to happen if it's going to happen, it's beyond in my confidence, i'm not going to give money on whether the election happens, let alone either way, who would win, ah shit, uh, i will read your... reiterate, somebody asked me about Jessie Venshura, I'm going to reiterate a little bit on Jessura and then i'll talk about the Kims. Jesse Vanshura, presidential election doesn't matter, he is methodone, I said this on the the ac uh the Assassin 33 episode, but I think we cut it, so I want to say it here then, and maybe I'll say it on the next episode I'm on, because I really want to get this across, it's like yeah, I was saying sure, vote for Jessecan sure, people freak out like, well he's not a socialist, and if you're going to go third party, well howy hawkins is a real trade unist, or relieva is part of a party, so socialism liberation connected to you know real marxist, it's like, stop it, that is the voot, that's the nonsense talk of of and crank idiocy, that's the that's the oregon grinder's monkey wheel of electoral politics, it gets all the uh, that's all the most earnest-minded cranks to get along with it, you got to ignore that sound, like you have to be willing to not dance when the tune is played, and of people that's hard because you want to move your hips. so you want to get down there, and when Bernie was a possibility, we were everyone was in the pit, they were going nuts, because there's fucking rules, but when he's out of there, I'm sorry, it's not worth dancing, you should just do something else, you honestly should do anything else, including think about what the fuck we're going to do about this, because these elections aren't going to have anything to do with it, it's all going to be us, so maybe don't give a shit about this at all, this is literally a distraction, so if you are going to have to like take some of that mana you were putting into the presidential election, you can't just turn it on, that's a blue balls, you have to be able to manage that the clention, you have to be able to manage the uh the osmosis, trans just to trans the pure energy level transfer of that, and if you want to do that, a vessel to hold your excess uh orgon energy there uh could be Jesse vanchuro, because he's cool, uh, he's a pimp, uh, he was actually a kind of effective governor of the state of Minnesota, he got a light rail uh through in the twin cities which is way more than uh uh uh Jim Doyle could say in in Wisconsin that guy was the fucking he was a two-term democratic governor before uh Walker uh and he didn't fucking get light rail through in two terms he and what I think matters most is that like one of the reasons Bernie was a vehicle was because it was he was he was a media identity and you need to get people through their understanding of themselves in the world and I'm sorry it's the media, we don't want that to be the case, but it is the case, we have to acknowledge the reality of media, and so that means we have this phenomenon that we can deal with, like that's why all third party shit like oh gloria riverkin's like, no, these this is just for you, this is this is for you, this is not for them, it has to be for them, and burny was for them, and Jessie van jura, hypothetically not in this world, but in another world. things a little different Jessera could be, absolutely just like Arnold Schwarzniger could have been if the fucking stupid constitution had been written differently you think Donald Trump beats uh Orwarznager he maybe beats him in a primary but seriously Schwarznager could have run as a democrat in 2016 and annihilated Trump he would have won the nomination and he would have destroyed Trump does anyone want to doubt any of that anyone i I know counterfactuals are stupid, but come on, if schwarznager changes legislation, changes the democrat, runs against Hillary, runs in the general, destroys it, and what I'm saying is like, that didn't happen, and there's a lot of reasons that it not just the constitution that that didn't happen, and but things a little differently, that could happen, things a little differently, just even sure could happen, acting like any of this is outside of reality, is silly at this point, but like I said, this is just a fun brain thing to do to keep. yourself something to do that used to be concentrating on the presidential election, it's not like you were trying to fuck to make a baby there, like a little a little, i don't know whatever you wanted to call it. we haven't known a name for it yet, maybe a little social, a little social democracy baby, but other people are like, actually no, uh, foolish socdem, in the inside this uh social democracy baby, you think you're incubating is actually a uh a workers uh uh uh work a working class baby who's going to uh from the inners of insufficient social democracy will burst forth this uh new class mobilization baby uh and then that will create. communism, whatever the fuck, you thought you were going to create something out of that, this is sterile, this is nutting into a sock, and that's fine, sometimes you got a nut to a sock, but that's it, you're jacking off, and that's what we should recognize all electoral post burny politics as, and specifically, whether or not you want to say for mean purposes and as a blowoff of steam that uh, Jesse Ventura is epic and root for him, because one, those things are not in. not non non-significant factors of politics, i think you can't acknowledge not, you could not deny now that those things have real power, whatever material reality is generating them and and determines them, they have at like the the at the point at at the at the point of like determining narrow outcomes, they absolutely have influence, so like is a way and and as a way to think about power, as a way to think about the media and its relationship to politics, the way it relates to uh yeah like the difference between a performer and a politician uh uh like understanding that difference and like utilizing different facets of celebrity for different political ends, all of those things can be interrogated through the vegecy ventura for president concept, which is why as a place for your access uh uh uh enthusiasms as i guess i used to say in the 19th century, have a little fun with Jessie, i will be, i have to do more than most because this is literally my job as a absurd and ridiculous and short-lived as that might be, um, and before anyone thinks that means, oh he's saying the chap was going away, it's like, I mean, who knows what's not going away, it's not about the show, it's about how like it only exists in certain um economic context that might not exist uh in the near future, but either way that could be good, like what if it is war communism, what if we do get like a fuck incarnation revolution, i would be happy to do that, i would absolutely give this stupid life up, go up to the fucking get, i mean i literally am disabled, it's funny, like i i never pulled the card and it's not on my bio and i hate that politics of it, but i literally am disabled, if anyone has met me they know that i'm not physically able so i'm not going to be able to you know how as many uh as many acres of potatos as maybe somebody else, but whatever you need me to do i would do and i'd be happy to do it, if anyone had me wanted to do anything that might? physical ability, i would do it, i do not demand to be anime appraiser, i swear to god, i do not demand to be anime appraiser, i will do some actual physical labor, pushing pencils, some cohegan. I think I askly answered this question about my favorite Ottoman Ottoman Sultan before, but I'll do it again. Selene the Grim, uh, I feel like he gets widely underrated, considering he doubled the size of uh of the dedoubled the size of the Ottoman Empire in an eight-year period, that's I mean come on, that's amazing, and it was consolid. too, it's not like with traision, like yeah, tresian took um, the Roman empire to its f, but they started trimming that immediately, i mean hadrians wal was put up after traision conquered Caledonia to be like, all right, yeah, but we know realistically where our rip goes, same thing with the Middle East, that didn't happen, he held it, he held North Africa until the mamalukes rebelled like centuries later, he held uh, he held uh the caucasus for a while, so yeah, I got to give it to Salim the Grim, even though not a lot. fun of parties, didn't last very long, got owned by his kid very uh, poetically. this is an interesting question, somebody says, was Charles Bronson the last, the best actor to get pigeon holed in reactionary action, one, it's a good question because i'm trying to think of other people who fit that description, who else is like a reactionary movie star? uh, charles. Ronson definitely, John Wayne, yeah, who else, are there any other like Clyn eastwood, I think, yeah, not like more thoughtfully, obviously, like he is uh, like like Eastwood is clearly. like a more progressive figure than uh johnny john john john Wayne was in every sense like uh uh I mean John Wayne was a was a uh very hypocritical uh uh uh uh decency monger and Eastwood was much more of a like California guy like a swinging uh 60s dude ask Sandra Lock she'll tell you or she could have before she died um but anyway but he was It was the same, it was the same values, like just modified given like the dissolution of uh the social mores that it held under Wayne, like recognizing the difference in culture, but who else, who else and then Bronson is sort of like the the like the the K-man version of that, like Bronson is the unreconstructed chunk, like if Eastwood is the uh, all right, this is interesting because they emerge around the same time as like stars 70s 80s, Death Wish and Dirty Harry, and Dirty Harry is. the civilized eastwood, it's it's or I mean Wayne, uh, it's John Wayne's American civilized and John Wayne's America, American synthesizing modernity, like that's what that's what uh, that's what uh Eastwoord was, that's what Dirty Harry was, Bronson, Kirsey was the was that slug, was the reactionary slug, the excess that had to get jettisoned to create eastwood. so that's what the death wish movies were and and and and of course I mean that follows too because Dirty Harry is an actual police officer and he never actually does anything in the movies it's illegal he's tough and of course like liberals and like attorneys and elite types might say what he's doing is wrong but he doesn't break the law unless he very absolutely has to and always in the service of greater good uh Bronson is explicitly a vigilanty who is not a cop does not abide by law. murders people with impunity like a guy who a guy who was the villain in a dirty harry movie, the bad guys in i believe it's magnum force are cops tim mathson a young tim mathson as a ring leader who are uh killing bad guys secretly uh they murder evil pimp and uh pornograpers and stuff um and dirty harry kills them all he's like he's putting it back in the container, you know, it's like these are these are the restraints that we need for a for a uh stable masculinity that can still persist at the top of the economic, like that's totally accepted because we're not challenging that, this is all about a cultural reconfiguration, power will still be distributed as it always has, money will still be distributed as it always has, excess uh surplus to put it the most uh blunt terms surplus will be distributed as it always has uh so that's all taken care of. is where do we fit on the on the uh on the stage coach? like where are we on the stage coach? and you know John Wayne, he's got to be, he's got to be in shotgun, fuck you, that's the only spot for him, women, women and like drunk Indians uh uh in the cat in in the actual uh uh stage coach, i'm i'm up here with the shotgun, eastwood's like maybe i'm in the back, maybe maybe give the girl a gun, that's funny, she's in bloomers and she's got double barrel like aunt may um little corncob pipe uh so it's all about like where you can like feel comfortable on the cart as it continues you know exploiting and excorporating and and hyper exploiting and and creating surplusses that are turned into these cultural curios and artifacts that you can value more or less based on your individual taste which are of course all determined by the culture that produces them blah blah blah and so... the synthesis so like the the police state uh harbangerered by uh by dirty harry comes into being the the carceral state we we know is now the tough on crime war on uh war on drugs American police state and cars real state to go along with it because you're arresting these people what could i be doing to you like that's the real thing it's like yes we're still keeping the lines of uh of property and we're still enforcing them arbitrarily at the at uh to the benefit of accumulated just heredity, basically, dressed up with different words, but heredity, total, just something that is clearly wrong, that cries out for uh, for regress in the heart of any like a human being, so it has to be contermand, which is what culture is there to help do, so yeah, so that creates Harry Callahan and the civilized masculine dominance, but that... leaves the excess, that's bernie gets, and that's John, and that's Charles Bronson. He is the cast off slug. of unreconstructed neandertholl white male masculinity that must be discarded if one is to create a synthesis. now the problem is there's so much other shit in the gears that that deal didn't work out as smoothly as anybody on any part of it thought it wide, and that means that all of the the detritis, the throw off, the runoff, the stuff that's you know uh endemic to any kind of mechanism, i mean it's it you know graft and shit builds up in the the... types of a car engine same with carbon and things build up, same thing as that. so yeah, bronson, he is. really the uh he's the last like right-wing action star buse i feel like for the most part like mainstream culture that agree that you're going to get the benefit of a budget that's going to get you talked about as our understanding hi of uh what like constitutes like a mass culture like at the level of a sagal or something i think politics has been suppressed i think like we're seeing like trump kind of represents this excess, this like cultural con this uh, these tension zones that are unresolved, that are supposed to be resolved by uh, by the market honestly, they're supposed to get paid off for, you're supposed to bribe them into being, those bribess aren't happening anymore because there's not enough money to make the payoffs, because the system isn't producing them, and this all started in the 70s with the uh, the stateflation crisis, the energy crisis, the the the profitability crisis of capitalism has been in since uh, that's the only way to understand uh the last four years of politics is a one crisis uh that has been in persistence since then uh and in America in the short-term uh domestic politics sense the way that's been resolved the crisis has been resolved through short-term bubble inflations uh defense industry in the 80s tech in the 90s but when that gets disrupted there's no more you know the money's got to come from somewhere and it came from uh working it came from uh uh the money that had to come from somewhere because the money in this case meaning profit, it's it's like either we're rusing pofit or we're getting it else from somewhere else and the first obvious answer was from labor and so that's what they started doing and from labor in the cultural terms means the people who are supposed to be signing off on all these cultural arrangements and the thing that makes those uh those tradeoffs uh acceptable is that they are accommodate they come with material uh races and senses that make those kind of cultural things matter less because you're comfortable, shit like that matters more of the degree to which you're in, you know uh, you're in general pain, your your life is generally uh uh constrained and and and defined by uh lack and by uh fear and like all negative emotions like if if you um the degree of which your life is like determined by those is the degree of which like things like that matter because it's literally it's like everything is in front of you and it's the only thing that matters. you can feel more magnanimously the less the degree to which things are more comfortable and so as the as that lubricant as the is the material lubricants went away cuz like that process has been happening like all these like oh look at the every single person who like does a meme where they show look at how cool guys back then were and they were all masculine and alpha if you went back then older b we were saying look at these fucking pussis look at these fucking pussis these guys used to be you can go back. literally to ancient rome and see that because it's an inherent process, it's a civilizational process, it is a, it's a dialect for fucking, it's dialectical, just if you if you understand it as that, it get robs of a lot of it gets robbed of a lot of the emotional stuff that makes it so hard, honestly like that uh to sound, i don't want to be like, hey man, get over it, but like get dialectical and a lot of this stuff doesn't really, i don't even i just... how do you even care? of course, like yes, this is all based on the back of hyper exploitation elsewhere, it's just that it was distributed among the top level more equitably, and there's nothing virtuous about this, and this is the thing that needs to get understood and that people, because the thing is this is all this, all this all we're talking about, all this language and our understanding of third world exploitation, all those things are only consumed and metabolized by liberal subjects like people at the top of this fucking food chain, so they have to they have to rationalize it somehow, it's built in, so uh, that's why if you think of it dialectically, man, it's hard to get too wide. wrapped up in any of this shit, but then that's because you're comfortable, what i'm saying? anyway, this is all about how what I mean by that is that like if the people who are on the bottom, if they were on the top they wouldn't be good by virtue of the fact that they used to be on the bottom, they would still suck, they'd be they'd be bad because they'd be exploiting, the fact that they were suffering would not make them exploiting good, and that is a fundamental misunderstanding that undergirds like 90% of uh of like of... of surface level understanding of things like identity politics and privilege theory, it's all based on the idea that it would be better if someone who's was oppressed does an oppression, um, and I think that's wrong, and I don't agree with that, and I feel like if you don't accept that as a beginning principle, it it can undermine your entire approach to politics, but anyway, all this is just to mean is that the reason that these that these things are thrown off uh your Elliot Rogers's and your pepes and your your your... little uh little creepy uh uh anhedonic little toadlet uh uh uh uh class uh it's it's because you can't buy them off anymore because it's not you can't give like it's not because we change culturally it's because it's no longer uh you literally can't have a one family household you're going to have two parents three kids i mean forget that forget all the even forget like the mid-century you know a consumer aspect of it, even if you said no, I don't, I don't even need a lawn, I don't need all that bullshit that was really all maddison, Madison Avenue's uh uh uh brain washing uh it was not actually part of any traditional lifestyle uh um if you throw that away it say I just want to be able to raise a family on an income you couldn't do it it's impossible so it creates new things about that and one of them is is that actually women it's good it's not only is it good to work or I mean not only no you don't have to work. actually it's great that you should work and uh it's empowering and it's the not only is it empowering, it's the only place to get genuine worth, congratulations, but it's all because there was no more because they had they got it from labor because they couldn't get it from uh from the market anymore, because of the because of things like the energy cris, the the change the energy market, anyway so it was uh defense in the night Regan, and then there was the first bot com buzzle which happened before 1911. uh which then coincidentally and very happily for some people created a new sort of kein military uh budget uh justification to to do like an 80's defense buildup again on top of which you did a uh another speculative uh uh housing bubble and a speculative tech bubble both of course of course embedded in the spending created and the the network of uh companies and budgets and uh and the created by the... we're on terror, um, and that, yeah, so there you go, wow, i mean, the thing is none of this is really brain mind blowing or anything, this is all pretty self-explanatory, but it's also hard to put together, man cuz they really don't want you to think of it all together, they want you to think of it all as discrete little question. and then you can have discrete good guys and bad guys, and then you can have discrete uh personal investments and emotional attachments that can accur to one or the other, and then over time you can confuse your sympathy in a situation with some objective moral stance or more importantly an objective like uh material insistence, not the same thing, uh bronson was a good actor, i mean come on, he was the last, he was the last but anyway yeah so like a guy like Bronson now couldn't be a movie star, a guy like Brons and now would have to be, he would have to be like a youtube guy or more realistic, i mean realistically he wouldn't be a actor at all, he'd be a fucking steel workorker or he'd be an out of work steel workorker, he'd be like he'd have uh he'd have like two kids with uh fentanial addictions and he would you know be a part-time walmart reader uh with a fucking uh you know end-stage alcoholic, that would be the reality of uh of the Mr. Majestic, Charles Bronson if he would like the version of him now, but if there was a cultural version of him now, it would be just like as an echo of him as like a crude puppet created by his uh, like his slightly better off suburban fail nephews and stuff, like holding up these like literally like dead, like day of the dead uh uh giant... uh uh puppets, like that's the that's the that's that's the real you know like they're all the grandparents shirts filling them up with what at the end of the day is just pure fantasy of that something regurs that they're only building out of like it's a it's a thing they're literally making a effagy they're making an effegy of like their fathers out of like the bone meal spit out by the machine but they are whatever that would be whatever disgusting bone meal and spit mummy would come out of that process it would be a youtube guy or it would be uh a school shooter, i don't know, it would it would be, it would, it would not be, it would not have impeture, that's what that's what it basically does, it would have to be unspoken of, it would have to be the subalter uh and it would have to be destroyed, but the thing is is that it's going to keep conflict is never going to end, because source of the conflict is the increased of friction, and you're not going to unless you putting unless you're gonna grease up, you got to grease it up and there's no grease. spit on your hand, there's nothing, and so it's just going to keep spraying unless you under, you get, you literally change the fundamental like network, problem is is the way you get to do that is by organizing people who are all cast off chunklets made by this fucking machine in the first place, it's tough, it's all stuff that makes you go, honestly uh, i love... that Felix is doing uh uh NBC, if you'd sold me when this whole started, all right, what is quarantine Felix going to get into, because I i i know he would do relatively well, you know, like you could like you can tell who you know who's doing better or worse and quarantine is largely the degree to which they were doing better worse beforehand, and the worse they were doing the better they're probably doing quarantine and vice versa, uh, and since you know Felix was always sort of in a crisis state, just like kind of antidonic uh and then needing like short-term fixations to sort of stimulate enough interest in him to keep like thinking life is like going through, he's talked about this on the show, the the dance between uh meaning and uh uh novelty um and so it was always gonna spin on something you know it's like barstool sports or uh or 12-year-old uh youtube kids or uh whatever landing on nbc prime time shows didn't see that one coming but I'm glad he's, I'm glad he has it, and I'm glad he's having a good time, like for me, doing these has been my thing, and it's been very helpful because I was like a couple weeks in I was starting to feel the fly wheels coming off, this is like help bause like I don't think I've gone, I i literally have lost track, and when I think of like how long I've been doing any one thing, I don't, man, it just feels like I've been in a tunnel this entire time, it just feels like I've been in a gigantic tunnel, just like... standing here this entire time so i have fucking i have no idea what time or place is but i don't think i stop i've missed one of these in um i mean i might not have put them all on youtube but i don't think i've been doing one for at least like half an hour at least half an hour for weeks and i hoping to do it for the rest of the quarantine time and maybe turn into something after that i don't know but short term what i want to do is put it on uh twitch which i need a little bit more help with the computer ship to do but once we've got it figured out this will be coming to twitch, which will be great, more interaction and stuff, and it'll like be easier to put on to youtube cuz apparently it's kind of annoying that uh for Chris to get these off of here and put on youtube, i don't i could be doing that, but do you yell at me, i'm an old man, i don't understand such things, you get my earring you talk about the button and thing, i can't download things i don't know, people like i was talk complaining about how your computer hears you say you want to see a movie or it sees you type hey look hey have you seen that in a while and then it goes into the your uh streaming services and it removes them from from the queue so you have to purchase them or rent them. 100% believe that's true and i've had enough people like say somethings like that happen to them to make care. um what was i say? shit i forgot what i meant but yeah no they're doing that they're doing that to us uh the the thing is there's no ways there's no escape and it's like oh no don't go on twitch it's like yeah but here i am on instagram. It's all just one giant throbbing tunnel that we're all being fed into, here it is, there's that's all there is, hello, hello, I see you, all right guys, see you tomorrow, stay safe, stay safe.
