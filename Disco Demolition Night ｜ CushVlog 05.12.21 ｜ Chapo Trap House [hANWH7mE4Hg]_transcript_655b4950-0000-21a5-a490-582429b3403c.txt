 on my pajama rolled out of bed and she went to the police station, he began to shout, started the investigation, it was against the law, it was against the law, what your mama saw, it was against the law, mama looked down and spit on the ground every time the name gets mentioned, papa said oh if i got that boy, i'm going to stick him in the house of the'. mention but I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going, I'm on my way, I'm taking my time, but I don't know where, goodbye Rosey, the queen of corona, see you me and down by the schoolyard, see you me and down by the schoolyard, okay, finally got it to work, didn't work at first, hello folks, the queen of corona, indeed, how have they not renamed that park? corona park, just sitting there in the middle of fucking queens, and they never rename the beer either, another thing I can't kind of get my head around, but they both seem like that would have been an no brainers, I guess you just don't want to uh, admit what's really happening, corona. in San Francisco, there we go, I got to say, someone says the new Snider movie, very excited for the new uh, Saxniter Zombie movie, because uh, dawn of the dead is probably his best film, and that opening sequence is really the best, it is the best, it's the closest any zombie movie has gotten to what I have always wanted in a zombie movie and never got, which is the actual moment. the the the the the the adramatization of the moment when the zombie crisis hits uh normality and disrupts it and and there is a uh they tried it in world the book world war z does a great job of that but uh the movie has just one stupid terrible scene where a bunch of guys are running around in philadelphia otherwise uh very lame but that opening sequence when it's the fucking suburban wakkashock county uh caldasac just going to hell, it's it's tasty, of course it couldn't sustain it because the rules of the game and also what's uh cheap to film don't really allow for that kind of thing, but i'm looking forward to it, the fact that they digitally replaced Chris Delia with Tignaro like a year after the movie was made is pretty funny uh so that'll be funny to see and also uh I'm interested to see how they get the incredibly stupid premise of bank heist during a zombie apocalypse, because a lot of people say what are you going to do with the money? my presumption is is that it's a contained zombie situation, the zombies like took over Las Vegas, but there's also now like a return civilization, but you got to figure post zombie apocalypse that they would have at least they would at least revalue the denar, you know, put out some new sort of currency, bitcoin. Maybe. Okay, so one bit of business before I start what I want to talk about today, and that is that for next week going to read the first three chapters of courbes, Yymar Republic. I'm not sure we might just read that and be done with it, because it's from what I understand, one of the best uh, his best like capsule treatments of the German Revolution, so uh, we'll read the. that and we will go from there, i i kind of have an idea that i want to read a Kim Stanley Robinson book, because a lot of what I'm going to be talking about and what I've been focusing on in my mind lately is is confronting the reality of living, trying to live and trying to articulate a political subjectivity at a time of full despare and I do think that there is a way that this spare can be grappled with and transcended and I'm trying to help, I'm trying to do it for myself, and I'm finding like by the day, I am able to do it, you know, and that's all it is, it's a it's it's never a it is a project, all life is that day-to-day project, that minute by minute project, it's not something that can be just uh turned on and off like a light, it's it's a daily struggle, but you can struggle uh easily or more difficultly, you know, you could be confronting the real thing or you can be... dealing with some epinomen of it that you then engage with instead and which will never allow you to get anywhere because you're never you're not actually confronting it. and so I wanted to maybe read something that because you know the despair is why I was looking backward, the despair is why I'm looking at you know the civil war and the German revolution and thinking like what could have gone differently where where is another where is that other world that we could be living in uh but also and but that's not the only thing I want I want to do with it because you know I still have we all have to live now uh so uh kingers Stanley Robinson has been doing a very interesting job in in trying to do non doom-based non-capitalist fantasy science uh futurist fiction which is very difficult because as we'll talk about the future now only belongs to the rich, the future has been privatized, the future are the only people who the rich are the only people who get to imagine a future. yes, ministry of the future is the one that i want to read, so we'll see about that after the ymart thing, so if you're rich, you can imagine a future. for your children, you can imagine giving them a world better than yours, because you can convince yourself uh the same way the mid-century modernists convince themselves about a middle class uh uh future, they can imagine a boutique rich person future, and all the stuff that's going to happen everybody else will be very unfortunate, but also unavoidable, inevitable, and not my problem at the end of the day. nobody else gets to imagine a future, when we think of what's coming next, it's just a black hole. terror and so that is one of the things that depoliticizes uh the mass of people because if you have no future that you can move towards realistically uh then what's the point of engaging anything why not as we talked about last week just try to solve in the shortest term possible my own selfish desires uh it's the only smart move in a futureless world so confronting despair is reclaiming the future in a lot of ways and and and accepting despair but accepting with it that you still exist and that you still have a beating heart and that something is driving it and to find what that is and move towards it, and we can all do that, but it means disengaging from a lot of the things that we have become addicted to, that have allowed us to to cope without actually. addressing and so I think reading something that is unabasched in its willingness to imagine a a human future, even though that is cringe, because my god how can anyone take it seriously? how can anybody take it seriously? we all know it's we're doomed, we all know that there's no fucking hope, look at the fucking hockey stick, look at who has the money, look who has the fucking technology, look who lo look what what kind of uh social cohesion we have or or uh class consciousness, that's terrif, it's a terrifying prospect, the math doesn't hold up, but so everybody has to risk cringing, everybody has to risk stepping off into the abiss and saying, i'm going to believe that we can do this, and so after we do this stuff with wymar, i want to read uh the uh ministry of the future by Kim Stanley Robinson, so that's we'll be doing. um, so to get to what I wanted to talk about today though, and dealing with despair, uh, is the in my mind, uncanny resonance between the current moment, I wouldn't say decade, because I think we're beyond the point, we're discrete decades, at least, maybe uh, we're beyond decades, or maybe they could only be understood in further retrospect than we have now. whatever you want to call it, this period, I would say post 2008, uh, whatever you want to call that, it's now what, it's now 12 years, 13 years, it's a long decade, let's say, is essentially the 1970s uh, being recapitulated in that it is an era of mass disillusionment from a uh, an understood system, the 1970s was... a decade when America throughout in every walk of life, not just the hippies who got disillusioned by the failure of their movement, everybody from Suburban Reactionary home owners to Hade Ashbury, burnouts, everybody got the Ned Bady speech, everybody got the uh the conversation with the man in the back of the room to tell them how things really were, everybody got to eat a naked lunch in the 1970s, because all of our illusions were no longer sustainable, our economy, the the the cansian welfare state that we built was no longer sustainable, the uh the social models we created. we're collapsing uh uh our expectation of advancement of a future better than our present that that that the fucking carrot on the stick of in America's exceptionalism has been extinguished we we uh all of our institutions were proven to be uh uh criminal jokes the media uh politicians uh, you had watergate, you had the church committee, you had a, you had the hangover of Vietnam, everyone understood, and then when you can buy that with just bread and butter stuff like the the real beginning of deindustrialization, and the massive strike wave, that's like the very tail end of American labor militancy sort of burned off, like the last excess energy the labor movement have burned off in a bunch of wild cat strikes in the... uh sort of a mirror of the burst of strike activity uh in the late 1940s that sort of set the stage for the it was the birth of the modern business-oriented collaborationist post war labor movement and it's and it began with a bunch of wild cat strikes in late 40s 1848 and it ended with a bunch of wild cat strikes in the 1970s and mostly failed, so the labor movement failed, it was a wash and corruption and it uh, it's it's was not unable to meet the needs of its members, the institutions that employed people were already moving jobs away, inflation and uh and unemployment coming together in a way that no economist thought was possible, and then the church, the church committee and the revelation that yeah, your government was spying on you and assassinating leaders and maybe killed the president. there was a house committee on assassinations in the 70s that found probable cause that Kennedy was killed as a part of a conspiracy, they put it at the foot of the mob, but nobody really believed that, and of course watergate, the African presidenty, the this institution that had a genuine uh, investment in the notion of the presidency, people believed in the president, in a fundamental way, now of course uh Vietnam certainly started creating that crisis of uh credibility. but what and that but then Nixon's entire behavior and then finally of course in in office and then of course watergate just destroyed it and so the systems failed uh it couldn't it was spiritually dead, it was corrupt and crooked uh and it didn't even function anymore at providing material gains and you had Jimmy Carter trying to to put out a liberal sort of pious uh pious gloss on. a need for America to regain spiritual uh uh he demanded that Americans refinend their non-material spirit at the very same moment that the credit card was being introduced in mass uh numbers for the first time the very first time that Americans were asked to fucking uh take on debt instead of uh save money oh yeah you got to stop being materialist but also you need to start charging money you don't have in order to maintain the fucking consume economy that we're replacing manufacturing with, so everything's broken down, Carter represents the very tail end of the liberal consensus when all of its bread and butter promises are gone and all that's left is its piety, is its smug morality, and of course that's not sufficient to the moment, but what is, and I think. I mean, this should sound familiar, like we are in that era, the Iraq, the fucking war on terror, the uh, the economic collapse, uh, the presidency of Trump in every, like if you're a liberal or or reactionaly, the the elections of just the the presidential elections have essentially destroyed any lingering faith you had in the system, but what this moment? disillusion is from, it's not, it's obviously not from the thing that was destroyed in the 70s, because what happened in the 70's, and this is the distinction between the 70s and now, this is what make, this is the significant, fundamental difference is that we were trapped in this uh, this m, despair in the 70s, all of our systems don't work, we don't even trust ourselves anymore because we don't even know who we are, and then into this morass, into this moment where everybody has taken the red pill and pulled themselves out of the matrix and found out that they live in mud puddle with no sun, and the task now to remake the world. with no tools, Ronald Reagan shows up, and this is and presents to people a chance to get back into the matrix. The Reagan, Reagan response was, hey guys, you know all this horrible stuff, we know, let's all forget about it, let's all pretend that this didn't happen, and we're going to be able to give you your uh, your your consumer. spending back, your confidence back, your uh, your sense of destiny and your sense of um, uh, your sense of self possession back, because you're going to going to cut your taxes, we're going to this whole government model, this whole cane and model, we're throwing that out, and we're going to we're going to bet on you, and given the options, that's what people chose, that's it was right there, of course, oh my god, what do we try this instead? what if we say, it's every man for himself, and if that's the case, I'm going to get ahead. We're going to get rid of the whole notion that there's any sort of social compact, and that will allow us to forget everything, because all that stuff, that was the old, that was all of the bad uh, accumulated gunk of of post-war liberalism, we can blow the fucking dirt off and start fresh, and then we have what's right about America, the good stuff. and so we built a new consumer-based economy based on that uh, but the thing is is that it wasn't just Reagan offering this, Reagan offered it to this the the the uh the mass audience of like suburbanites who make up the center of gravity of American politics, that was the his pitch, that was the pitch they got was from Reagan, and it sounded great, but everybody got a pitch, like I've been reading recently about some of the early 70s like psychonaut. guys like uh like Robert Anton Wilson and Terence McKenna all those like uh psychedelic dudes who hit the fucking hard edge of the failure of the 60s uh and their faith in the ability of like the individuated consciousness of people to come together to overthrow evil because remember uh the American like counterculture was broadly libertarian because it was middle class. It rebelled against the status quo because it restrained the individual. That's one of the big reasons it was unable to be politically effective. So the 70s saw this crisis along every axis, not just at Middle America, but among the most advanced progressive elements who did not have any connection to a class project or a class consciousness. They had a desire to transcend. they wanted to skip over class because it's too hard, it's too tough in America, and because we're too isolated from it, and because it threatens our autonomy, and we really do, we really do value our autonomy, America throughout even our left throughout America has been wildly uh, uh, suffused with our basic uh, ideological understanding of freedom, I mean, how could it not be, where else is it coming from, it's generated by our culture and and and even our even at its most powerful our our working class political consciousness was emmeshed with it as well. so the dream after the failure of the people to organize in the 60s became well we will get over the bump of organizing by literally just expanding consciousness like uh John Lily and fucking uh Timothy Leery all of these dudes were like we're just going to use our brains. to like fix the secret, get a frequency that overwhelms everything, all of our structural impediments and of course this is very non-dialectical and it's very non-marxist, but that's because this is what they had, and this is what they had their brains were by then uh, and even they got a deal in this in the 80s, even they got an an opening that allowed them to move forward out of despair, and it was networking. cybernetics and the internet, the California ideology, the California ideology was the was the defeated counterculture on the west coast trying to get around the question of politics by creating a technological infrastructure of communication that would lead to a raising of consciousness that would literally allow us to evolve beyond the needs for these institutions that are imprisoning us, and those guys a lot of them ended up working with early internet pioneers and and early uh computer research and there was a huge uh overlap in in in in computer science and that like psychodelic uh uh uh ideology and here we are now after having the internet around for 40 years, here we are now where no one can promise what Reagan promised, we can only blame others for the doom, that part he was good at. but he was also good at sketching an alternative, no one can believe in that, because the neoliberal state that Reagan built and that that people uh invested belief in and that they reconstructed uh uh and reinvested their belief in institutions like media and government around has now failed the same way that the post uh war Kanesian consensus failed in the 70s, it has now failed as as comprehensively. and even more dramatically buse the 70s really was this weird like frog in a pot thing, this was a collapse and then a re making of the economy in the aftermath of the collapse that destroyed the last lingering uh public investment in amer in America's like economy, home ownership. and so now you can't believe in any political alternative that's going to wipe the slape clean like Reagan promised to and give us a new thing to believe in and gives us a chance to forget we can't forget and then even at the margins you cannot hope for some sort of uh technological spiritual transformation because we know what that leads to the California ideology he led to the creation of the single most effective communicator of uh of a demirgical uh superstructural mind prison, you could imagine, they without even having to use the little nanobots, they they essentially put a fucking panopticon in our own minds, forgetting what what any kind of uh actual surveillance technology we now are subject to, which is comprehensive, we have what, we have the panopticon in our mind now, so we can't even believe in. so we have to believe in something else, and it can't be the self, because all of these things are premised on the self, and our crisis now is that we can no longer reconcile ourself as we understand it with the world we're living in, and that means we have to change our perceptions of the self. and that is the hope we must fixate on and the hope that exists and cannot be denied is that that despair is premised on an understanding of ourselves that is that assumes as inviable this uh this transactional relationship we have with our each other and the very fabric of reality this this isolated this isolated that we operate from the the premises of because it's in that context that all that disillusion of the 70s only led to reaction because we were disillusioned, but we were not reillusioned, we not we were notillusioned around the necessity for our collaborative action, we were in fact only reaffirmed in the futility of collaborative action, but now... there's no, there's no, there's no vent, there is no promise that can be made plausibly, and that means we're going to have to just out of sheer survival instinct going to have to change, because even our most selfish instinctive desires are now in conflict with our ability to sustain ourselves in this time, and so without any more, without any dream. transcendence without any fantasy of of of reorientation of the economy coming from the structures we have, we will all and our own timelines be forced with a a final confrontation with the box with no fucking windowless room, we're going to find ourselves with no escape, and then we're going to have to make one, instead of taking the one that... offered us, instead of going where they where they heard us, we're going to have to fucking start bashing on the walls ourselves and cutting fucking holes in where we see fit. "I do not understand cybernetics, excuse me sir, I don't know anything about computers, I am saying one thing I there's one thing I know about computers and it is that the promise of computers in the 70s uh has led to a reality that is the diametrical opposite of everything that the people who put them together claimed, I think even to themselves they were doing. somebody asked what disco demolition night is and i got to say surprise uh that i mean i guess i shouldn't be, you guys are all kids, i don't remember this, but it's one of those historical uh curios i really like, so uh in, i believe it was what night, what year was it, what year was it, i don't the specific year, it was 1979, it was july 12th, 1979. uh, there was a double header at uh, Kimiski Park in Chicago and as a promotion to get people in, they had a local radio dj from the north suburbs who was making a name for himself as a fervent hater of disco. He would talk about how much disco sucked, he would he would uh make fun of it all the time on a show and and he was holding. the standard for rock and of course people talk about how that is uh you know that's all a reactionary like white supremacist uh uh instinct it's a revoltion at like the queer blackness of disco uh and it's like an expression of that probably do a degree I don't know uh but so they one way or another they decided that they could get people into the stadium by having this dude uh run a promotion where if you you could get in either discounted or for free if you brought a disco record with you to the to the first game and then at the moment between the games they were going to take all those uh uh albums that have been collected put them in a big pile in the middle of the outfield and run them over with a uh like a bulldozer i think like blow them up the... they used explosives and they did it, and it was uh, not a good idea, it was, it was a mistake, uh, because for the first of all, everybody who came was essentially uh, insane, like they were all shit face before they got there, they were all wild as hell, and then once the fucking bombs started going off, everyone just lost their shit and you had this explosion. of of uh of just libidinal energy, you just you you could just see how how if you get people together uh, and you simmer the crockpot the right way, it could just pop off, and so they ended up having to cancel the second game and the white socks forfitted because they couldn't take control of the fucking stadium. Nichol uh, 10 cent beer night was in cleveland, that's another good one, that one everyone got. shit face that they had to uh, the Indians had to forfit the second game in the double header because fans jumped on the field and tried to fight the Royal's outfielders, or the rangers outfielders. Oh man, someone wants me to talk about the loco focos, the loco focos, great name, one of the best names for a political faction in the American history, the 19th century really did have all the best political faction names, you had the loco focos, you had the hunkers and the barn burners, you had the mug wumps, you had the half breeds and the stalwarts, all very good. so the local focos were a faction of the New York City Democratic party that was a self-consciously working class arrangement they were they uh had been they were named that because there had been a uh meeting of of democrats in New York uh and there been a dispute uh between the the the workes as they were called the labor the laborers uh who made up the part of the party and the regular democrats, and the the workes uh went into their own hall to uh have a a meeting and the light were turned off, like the the the candles were blown out by a uh, by the regulars, and then to light the room, the the workers pulled out these self-lighting cigars that were popular at the time, you'd like pull them out of the tube and there would be an internal uh match and it would light the thing, and so they pulled out their local focos and they held them up to get the light going, and that's what they were called, and they were the first real self-aware uh working class formation within the Democratic party uh, but the thing is is that they didn't really have any significant effect on or influence of the party because they were so, it was so protein and the issues that there was still such a a a unformed conception of like what working class interest. were at that time because there were relatively few uh urban laborers in the country at that point uh and it is one of the one of the things that contributed to America's relative reactionary politics relatively reactionary politics and and failure for any labor party to sustain itself is that uh America because of its ability to to uh trade land for disconent. uh was able to create mass democracy earlier than Europe was, so that by the time you saw mass working-class politics emerge in late 1800s, uh, it ended up being funneld into the Democratic party, whereas in Europe there had been no mass politics before that point, which meant that the parties that were emerged were self-consciously oriented around and dominated by uh the workers, whereas at the height of their influence uh within the democratic party uh like the working class as such was always one element of a coalition and was never the director of a party and the local focos were the first little burst of of working class uh energy around um the democratic party the loco focos. and uh one of the big loco foco uh demands was at this time which was dominated by banking as the main domestic issue as the main political terrain of argument uh it was banking and it was the question of whether you're going to have uh where you're going to have a a national bank like the Wiggs wanted or you're going to have uh a system of pet regional banks uh or then later an independent treasury like the de wanted all the way to in one way or another uh keep the reality of the states role in uh creating currency away from politics which people thought even at the uh even regular Americans thought was freedom, they thought that an independent treasury was somehow possible and would protect their liberty and uh sure shit didn't end up happen. but there were a bunch of questions one about how are we going to charter banks? how many banks are going to be allowed to operate? who is going to decide who allows a bank to be chartered? because one of the big complaints about the uh early 19th century banking system is that banks were banks needed to be chartered by states and those charters were often given to friends of politically influence. people as you would imagine uh, there's a reason that the jackson network of banks were called pet banks, because they were all parts of the uh patriage networks around the the democratic party where the banks existed, and those banks were the sole distributor of uh paper currency in the country, because there was no national currency at this point, we had gold as the standard, but there was no national gold backed currency. banks would have a certain reserve of gold that they could then lend paper currency out on essentially and that is what created the amount the uh amount of currency that that facilitated economic activity uh and that so the battle over the banks really was this battle over where uh who would decide what where money is and how and and uh and how much money there would be, uh, but the problem is from the point of view of a working class politics, uh, the actual answer of the state determines it, we should do it collectively. and we should do it uh democratically was not conceivable uh the the the the working men of America, the laborers believed that the greatest freedom was in the greatest abstraction away from politics of the money supply, which is mystification, but the closest thing that existed and which the local focos insisted upon uh was an idea for free banking, and that meant anybody. could charter a bank regardless of uh their relationship with the state, they didn't need to get a charter, they could enough people could get together and they could declare a bank to exist. uh, and uh, this was very popular at the high end of the democratic party, it's elites, because if a lot of uh powerful people could then get more bank, access to uh to credit to create banks uh, because they could access this new. system without having to go through the uh the checks having to make the right negot uh the right deals and having to deal with the uh like the quotas on banks that were allowed to be chartered and so the local focos's thought that the best thing for the working man was to allow everybody to have a fucking bank and that was like a primitive attempt to articulate a a social uh economy but just too early. Favorite Elroy novel character, I always love American Tabloy because it's the first one I read and it blew my mind uh and obviously all of his characters are archetypes, so you're really just asking when you're saying which favorite character, which is your favorite expression of which is one of your favorite Elroy archetype. because you've got the uh the violent but secretly sensitive bruiser, your Bud White, your Pete Bonderant, you've got your uh uh, your smooth operator who's slowly coming coming apart of the seams, like Jack Vince and Kemper Boyd, and then you've got your uh cowardly nerd who is addicted to his own self-rightteousness, but is too weak. to pursue his own uh values like ward little or uh ed Exley and I have said before that uh if you had the buzzfeed if there was a buzzfeed quiz are you camper uh Pete or Ward from American Tabloid uh everybody who is on Twitter would including myself would get warred so although I think Pete Bonaront is a huge uh just absolute pimp and I think he's cool uh so just from that perspective. my favorite character of his in cool points is Pete banderant uh the one that I relate to the most is of course Ward little. I love the idea that he made him just a a fucking kinuck that he made him a kebaquais, no need a seven foot tall Knuck. snapping people's necks, yeah, definitely, american table is a great place to start because it's the first book in a trilogy, there's no other uh stuff that you need to know beforehand, but if you do read them all uh, and then you run to read the la quartet, don't do what i did, i very cuuse i didn't really know enough about it. i just went to the library and started reading uh after i read all his other stuff uh is that i read white jazz before i read any of the other la quartet and that was a mistake because it really is a cool culmination of a bunch of stuff in la confidential that didn't hit the way that it would have if i had uh read at least LA confidential first so for the love of god read la confidential before white jazz. there's a somebody says they only read American tablade, my god, yes, the cold 6,000 and bloods a rover, a lot of people don't like blood rover because it is very different than his other stuff. It's more contemplative and romantic, but I think that as the culmination of that project, it's really fitting, especially since the cold 6000 is so brutally alienated, the cold 6000 in part because it's so big and it has so much plot in it, I mean it's got the like American tables about the lead up to the Kennedy assassination uh cold 6000 features the RFK and uh Kennedy assassinations in it and uh has a whole bunch. more characters and stuff, so in order to accommodate that, he essentially just brush that thing down to every sentence during just object, verb uh, as few as words as possible, and so it's very, it's almost it's it's avant guard and it's tearsness, uh, so it's a it's a very, it's a whiplash, but it's very uh, it's fun. We might get a stag flation again, who knows? I mean, I didn't want to get into this too much cuz. I don't want to get all like, I don't specul, I try not to speculate anymore, because that's what really got me wound up in the lead up to the election, and then all the stuff after that is having to have an argument, a take that I could really feel like I understood and and felt confidence in about the future, uh, that's why I've been sticking with history, but uh, we have reached the point now. after 2008 where all of the illusions that used to shroud our uh system or our political economy are now gone. one of the big reasons that the 2008 collapse happened was that after there were the first few bucklings within the institutions uh of wall street uh the first uh instinct of the powers that be was to and i feel like this current moment right now where you're seeing these insane escalations of in every segment of the economy, the creation of new fake simulated things to have bubbles about like NFTs and and is proof that everyone at every level of control of this structure knows that there is nowhere else for the money to go, that that the the American dollar and and it's uh uh investment pools, the American state, basically is the only place to for the money to go, it's it's the whole at the end of the of the uh, it's the whole at the end of the gutter, it's all getting sucked down, so they'll just keep inflating, everything just has to keep inflating, what's going to pop it, what? pops every other bubble was when the money stops coming in right? in the 19th century what would happen is is that you'd have a big speculative bubble around land like in the 1830s or about railroads in the 1870s and then the Europeans would uh decide to bring back some of their spece or invest somewhere else and then boom you'd have a giant collapse. there's nowhere else for the money to go. where is else is the money supposed to go? people talk about uh the end of America's reserved currency status and that would be game over if that happened, but there's nowhere else currently up to the task, so how the fuck does this thing sustain itself? it seems like it shouldn't, but also it keeps doing it and there isn't any alternative and no one at the top seems that worried about it, but that's the thing, if you're at the top of this system, even if you knew for a fact that all these books are cooked and the end is going to and this economic structure is going to break down, the supply chain itself is going to break down in the near future, you wouldn't behave any differently. than they would than they are right now, because why the hell would you want to spook the horses, especially when you have already made it so that you know if that does happen, you'll be fine, internet advertising, thank you, the data is worth nothing, this is a perfect example, so that's a bubble that should pop at some point right, the data dollar in in the silicon valley, because we know now pretty definitively that none of that data is worth anything, those clicks are worth anything in included in terms of adding value to the companies that pay for them, but it doesn't matter if everybody knows that, if every single person involved in all of these transaction transaction is aware of that, their incentive is still to do it because it's what keeps the fucking the uh tech economy going, it's the only dynamic sector, so we're a situation where it will continue. to go until it collapses, because all of the incentives of everyone in a position of power are to keep it going, because they don't have to actually risk anything, because you could say, oh no, wouldn't that hurt their their investments and stuff, well yeah, but they would not be like it would put them in actual danger of of losing their position, i mean if we're not, yeah, oh they might move their they might lose their their money, but they won't lose their position, they will have created their own technological bubbles that will allow them to sustain themselves in any eventuality, and if that's the case, if you've got that backstop, then why wouldn't you just keep going through the motions until it buts up, the only question is when is it, when does it pop? and the thing that keeps fucking with me is how is it going to pop? where will the interrupt? and flow go, have we created a global system that is now self, it's like fluid karma from uh southland tails and it just the the the very motion itself pulls it forward, it's fucking wild, and yeah it's like obviously eventually climate change will pop it just in terms of the resource flow and then that's the end that's that that's the wheels will come right off, but that is not going to be a that is not going to be a dramatic thing is the thing, climate change effects for the forseable future are going to be uh, they're going to be metabolized by the system, like uh, disasters cost money, but they also provide speculative investment opportunities. Disaster capitalism always has its uh, its creative destructive potential in every uh failing, or in every in every emergent crisis, as long as there is a a uh a a a some sort of equilibrium that can be maintained, it will be, what will happen is that the edges will continue to be put uh eaten away, the edges of what is considered the market, what is considered the political sphere will will be eaten away. There's a story, a horrifying story about that I read about how uh people in northern California whose homes were burned down during the big camp fire there last year uh are still homeless and are now being rousted out of the places that they have uh set up camp by the police, so these are people who until a year ago were solid citizens, tax payers, 'who are on the inside of the citizenship bubble, people who deserved, people who who were part of us, who deserve some sort of uh, some sort of uh basic human dignity and and access to redress, their house gets burned down by a fire, they can't get another, they can't just build another one, they're out of the club, they're now out there homosa'. bunch of people in southern Louisiana are are been that way since that last big uh uh hurricane and I think the the dream of... the of the big collapse is the dream where collapse comes fast and hard and with it at least a glimpse of freedom, at least a glimpse of the ability to a chance to remake your relationship to your world because all of the restrictions and restraints and demands of life have changed, you get to get closer to the vitality and you get to fight for yourself and others. because the alternative is one where you just go from being totally under the command of the system, but also within uh, a pocket of rights and and expectations of of uh of rights to being outside of that, but still under the control of systemic power, the the thing stays there. It's just the wall moves and you're on the other side of the wall now, but you're still in the sightline of the fucking cyclopedian panopticon tech drone state, only now you don't have to, now you're not being compelled by credit card debt and medical billing, you're being compelled by a fucking uh, like in a drone hovering over your head telling you to move on. So this is why I said why I want to read something that confronts this this moment and imagines away out because we all have to imagine a way out for ourselves if not for the world and I don't mean transcending the problems, I mean transcending our soul sickness at the scale of the problems, transcending our paralysis in the face of the problems. now numbers are off. weird all right, I'm going to wrap up here in a minute, maybe answer a couple questions. Yes, we need Mariann Williamson, no, Mariann Williamson and uh and Jessie Vencera, that's what we need, no, that's I think we're past politics, honestly. man like it feels like everything is really simmering though, like Israel, that's that's a lot of. that's a lot of that's intense and then colombia i mean it's it's been just one rolling uh uh crisis everywhere even uh obviously here last summer, but it still have, but it still has this this horrible stasis to it, it's the it's i think the thing that is so alienating and terrifying and and and bewildering about the moment is that everything feels fully liquified, but also totally overdetermined, and i feel like that's the 70s too, like oh my god, nothing is working. every every structure uh is leading us towards oblivion and yet none of them seem to actually be losing their power over us and so that really gives you the sensation of being locked in a in a car in a airplane where the pilot is jumped out and you're on course to hit a fucking mountain and then you just have to spend your time trying to come to terms with what's kind of come unless you figure out way to get in the goddamn cockpit and get a goddamn one of the things and call someone at uh at air traffic control and and talk your way out of it. yeah, i saw the fucking Ned Lamont, god what a name, blast from the past, the guy who was like the netflix, the netflix, the net roots candidate who is gonna uh, who beat Joe Leberman for the senate uh, seat in conneticut and then was beaten by Joe Lieberman when Joe Leeberman ran on a third party like independent Joe Liebeman party ticket with the support of I think a majority of republicans in Conneticat ended up voting for him which is how he got back in and then Med Lamon ended up running for uh governor uh what a year or two ago and now he's grover Clevelanding it throwing out the national guard to uh to stopt a nursing home strike it is interesting, there's a lot of people have theories about the care economy being the care economy being the next real uh main front of the labor of the the uh the labor movement and and and workers struggle, i mean we'll see, this is a good if if it gets stamped out by this fucking geek this easily we'll see. Who knows? don't know yet. i'm imagining just like the the the the troops from like the crazies just coming into a nursing home with their fucking m16s and stealing people's uh medicine, just getting robot tripping in the in the uh in the infirmary. I don't actually know what robotripping is, is that about taking robotusson? I don't know, holding your breath. It would be really funny if Biden just cured cancer though in the middle of all this, like biden just comes out and those guys cancer's done, if it was a what was it, what if it was a vaccine though, what if there, what if there was a cancer cure, all cancer is cured, obviously this is impossible, i'm saying whatever, cancer's cured, but it's a vaccine. I kind of think a lot of anti-vaxers would would cave just because how scary cancer is. Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine, but once again it's for like specific types, like there is no overall cancer cure, although I don't know, I got to think that there has to be some genetic thing you could do, some switch you could turn off. Yeah, what if you just injected yourself with like shark shark spurm or something? those guys don't get cancer. I if I learned anything from deep blue sea, it's that uh... Sharks don't get cancer or uh alzheimers. should you rewatch deep blue always? it's classic for a reason. okay folks, talk to you probably on friday and then next wednesday we'll uh talk about the first three chapters of the cool book, just be wrapping up about the uh the the many bungles of the of the SDP and uh and Frederick Ebert who we all got to give two big thumbs down to all right, bye-bye.
