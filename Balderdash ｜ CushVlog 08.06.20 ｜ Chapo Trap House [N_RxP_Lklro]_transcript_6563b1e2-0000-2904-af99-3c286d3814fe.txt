 we on. are we going, is it happening? it's happening, yay, we're here, we're on, we're broadcasting live, how you guys doing, beautiful day, got a little bit of nice low humidity for the day, uh, we'll see how long that lasts, probably not too long, but i'll take it while i can get it, just went for a walk in the park, it was very nice, or for an old stroll, appreciate the work of good old kelbert vack. as buddy frederick law Olmsted did a good job is this berry look right yes i generally prefer uh uh black cherry i think that's the goat salter flavor that's number one but a lot of time it's not in my bodenga or my kit my my grocery store so i get what's available uh yes I would say top three are black cherry, watermelon and berry. Polar is very good, that's usually what I get, but they didn't have any parcherry and I really like that one, not a fan of the uh of uh grapefruit, so wanted to start today talking about something that popped up in the old discourse, once again i apologize for referencing the internet, it's it's a it's but at the same time trying to talk about things and given my limited little space there's very little I could report on in my life uh that's very relevant so I kind of have to stay at that level for now I don't think forever but right now I'm feeling still kind of we're still in a loose sc quarantine, but in one that sees me not really interacting that much with the world, certainly in a political sense, but damn it, there's always something to talk about on that internet, and I like to think that for the most part I just use it as a entry way to talk about something that's more uh, abstract and applicable beyond that narrow aperture. so there was an article in Jakomin about how the US has incredibly uh draconian open container laws and it's stupid and people should be able to drink in public like adults like we do in most other countries and to me that seems like very very obvious very self-evident thing I mean and if you wanted to be super woke about it if you wanted to be 1619 project about it you could talk about how wow why is America have such more stringent uh open container laws and say Europe it's because there are another way to police minority. communities and there's something to that, and yet there was a backlash to that article about people getting mad and saying, look at these uh, bougeois gentrifiers uh, uh, just complaining cuuse they want to be pretend like they're in Berlin and be able to drink outside, ooh, fucking uh, font leroys, why should i care? fuck that, have the cops taze them so that i don't have to see their frat antics, now part of that, now that's a baffling, that's a baffling response, and once again, hate to talk about the internet, but I think that the the nature of that response, which seems honest face to be so shocking, reveals a lot of things, not just about the dynamic online, but about the dynamic of the American left in general, uh, and first of all, you've got the fact that for some people it is, they hate jacobin because they have an esoteric problem with it is a project and they're going to hate everything and they just pull something out of a hat, so that's one group, you don't really have to consider them too much. another group are people on the left for whom being on the left means it's if I'm on the left and I'm have a stried enough voice and certainly if I press the identity politics buttons in the right direction people have to talk to me, people have to acknowledge me, people have to be my friend, and that's a big thing on the left is a lot of the a lot of the discourse, especially about interpersonal stuff within organizations, DSA for example, boils down to it's problematic or it's reactionary to not be my friend, and and for those people, especially the ones been so successful at having friends, seeing people talk about thing like public drinking gets them furious, because it reminds them all the fun they don't have, and they they want to remind. people, no, this is the left, this is where you listen to me, because this is the only social situation where anyone would listen to me by their own volition, because they've convinced themselves that i have something to say, but in reality i am just a wildly unpleasant person to be around and is decided that that's actually the world's fault, and exert that by getting angry at anyone who would raise an issue that would only apply to people who are you aren't neurov you know problematic uh you know uh having enough spoons, having the spoons to drink, like some people don't have the spoons to drink, and you're ignoring all of us spoonless people, which that's just personal infective, this is just personality disorder describe this this uh massed as politics and then there's the last group, which i think is kind of the most interesting, and that is people who they read that and they don't think about the obvious person that this is uh this is referring to in terms of you know talking about real um talking about real social oppression to talk about this as something that makes society less free, less uh just, something that makes it harder to be a minority, harder to be poor in this country. uh, but that's not what they think of when they read that, they immediately think of the people who write it, wrote it and the people who are reading it, and the people who wrote it, and the people are reading it are all members of that same. downwardly mobile urban pmc that is that is generally in my opinion the constitutive body of the self-conscious left in America, not necessarily everyone has leftist beliefs, but I'm talking about the self-identified, identified left, and so they read that think, oh you fucking you jackoven fucking broshulists, uh, you just want to be able to have a beer, beer kegger in front of your uh gentrifying ass brownstone that you your parents you fuck you, and the thing is is that seems insane, hey, what are you talking, we're talking about the real people who are suffer from this are mostly working-class urban minorities, but since that's not who, that's not who wrote it, and that's not who's reading it, including the people are mad, the people hated the article, none of them are, they're all the same group, they're all the same group, and they're end up fighting a battle, i mean i it's trivial, but like it creates battle lines that are generated by just this stew of uh personal personality-based uh resentments, and that's why politics is a dead letter, because you have a perfectly good policy that could be something that could unite people in across urban neighborhoods, from the gentrified areas to the to the not yet to be against police authority in their lives, but people got to get self-conscious about the cultural implications of it. because only one group is being talked about and that creates anxiety everyone knows that there's no like diversity in this movement, that it doesn't include basically any poor people of any kind, very few poor minorities, almost no poor white people, and once again when I talking about the self-consciously identified left, which as I'm saying is also mostly a online phenomenon, and so this thing just spins off on its own with no connection that would grown. thought about it for a second, because all that personal shit would just dissolve in the reality, but there is no reality, because this is not a genuine working class emanation, and i understand actually why people want to fight on the cultural ground, not just because it's something they can do, but you had a real meaningful contribution to marxism, when he know that the function of hegem. because there's a certain sterility to the base superstructure dynamic, because if it's just that right, if it's just you've got an economic base that determines the the presiding cultural values and and and ideas of a society that then filters through all institutions, how could anything ever change, like even if things get worse that worses is going to be diffused and transformed by culture into its opposite and then society will maintain its structures and whereby working class people create their own dense social network that is essentially resistant to the overall hegemony and over time can uh can defeat it in in the battle for the majority of people's mind space the war positions he called it and that's real that's a real thing and that's a real phenomenon and certainly in like the post capitalist west that's the reality of the terrain of social but the problem there is that in that analysis you to look at the culture as is and specifically the culture of something like i don't know the online left and you see that as a as an an emation of counterhegem uh but it's not it's not part of a counter hegemoneny, it is part of the ruling hegemoneny because it is not a working class movement, it's not a working class cultural movement the way that the uh social democrats in Germany built, especially the way that the communist party of Italy did after World War II, like that was genuine, those were genuine counterhegemonic uh movements, because what the what marks theorized to happen, what you saw happen in the in the satanic mill towns of of post Industrial revolution, Europe, is that the density and the and the social and the similarity of social conditions and the geographic uh... uh the geographic closedness of working class communities meant that there was like as as society emated trickled as as hegemonic concepts trickled down through social institutions to the working class counter hegemonic notions were rising up from the connection between people on the work in the workplace which which because they were closer to the ground have more power and over time can create institutions and enduring cultural structures that are counterhegemonic, and that is not what we have right now, uh, what we have right now is a left that is one specific segment of the broader, you couldn't even call it working class, it's not, it's it's part, because the thing is the job is is is less significant than the cultural uh framework because itself limiting, what it means is that this is not an phenomenon that expresses a counter-hegemonic uh working class American culture, it represents a very specific subcultural emanation within a broader social media uh cultural hegem, not corner hegemony. working class culture on the other hand is basic a broad one is essentially a dead letter because the uh because of the way that geography and uh and the workplace and and and labor in America has has broken up relations, turned us from potatoes in the sack to pringles in a tube, and the challenge is to actually build genuine working class cultural institutions, and that's very difficult because everyone who is self-consciously in the matrix of opinions and and action that form you know the left are almost inherently broken away from it and i mean this is another one where i don't really know the answer but i just know that that the holes were been we've been trying to draw water from or fucking dry. I've actually been watching uh not old SNL episodes but I've got YouTube on my TV and sometimes I'll just for a little bit put on random old uh sketches, not that old recent ones because you know I only see them once, the older sketches I sort of have in blasen in my head from watching them on comedy central as a kid a bunch of times, but the more recent ones i watch buse they just go in one way or not the other and I've just kind of reappraised them and go wow yeah no it's bad it's bad. It's as bad as it's ever been uh, it's the same thing as ever and yet somehow worse than it's ever been, isn't that what Feix says about America, and isn't it the most true thing that's ever been said, about everything you could say, this is basically what is always been quality wise, and yet somehow worse, and that is SNL. Do I identify as based uh carbon-based? Nice, I should get that for a t-shirt, I'm gonna get, I got to get a t-shirt that says, yes, I based carpet based and just do the biggest soy face in human history, put it all over the internet, ah. "I think I've given my opinions on anarchism in here before, that it's essentially like hyperliberalism, it's liberalism taken to its most socially radical, or or like it's most, it's it's liberalism taken to its most radical conclusions, but that the end of those conclusions and there that's still just, that's still just the end of liberalism, whereas what you need is something other than liberalism." there must be a deeper meaning behind or ironic soy facing, i think that's interesting because i have seen, i remember after the right wing guys, after the altright guys invented soy face and people start doing it ironically, they get really mad, they be like, just cuuse you're doing it ironically does mean you're not really one and you're actually doing it ironically because you know deep down that you're soy, and the thing is is like, i mean it's a it's a tautology, it's like they've just said everything i don't like is soy, it's like well i don't care if you don't like me, you suck. sure, i'm soy, whatever, i don't care, like you, i don't, your values are bad, i i'm glad that i don't adhere to them, but it's just fun, i got to say, i give, i got to give him that, why aren't i vegan, give me a break, give me a time, i'm on a fucking process here, okay, i've been, i've been a, i've been a hedonic uh, slug my entire life, it's not gonna be a 180, i'm not gonna, i'm not gonna turn on a dime, if i tried it would, i'd snap in half like a twig. but I think I'm on a good path, I think I will get there someday, why is the Khive so psycho? uh, that's a good question, I was thinking about that today, because so Freds and I were talking about the VP swits, vp. the veep stakes and about how you know oh vidon's really he painted hisself into the corner with this black woman thing and you know it's probably bad that he doesn't feel like he has more variety and then somebody said it would be hilarious if he picked mit Romney and the thing is is that he's not really restrained to pick a black woman because according to the vast majority of these people uh who will really care like obviously for most people vp picks are meaningless this is really... just about like shaping narrative and keeping your uh motive most motivated volunteer type people and like leading edge uh voters uh excited uh it's not going to matter to the general public but all these people who say who are now like he's got to pick a black woman and all that if he doesn't they are on record without anything to do because they have said explicitly that they will not abandon him because of the importance of beating Trump which means that they he could pick anybody he could pick Chris Dodd. guy is basically a clone of him, he could pick hunter, he could pick Rint Romney, and what are they going to do about it, what you going to do, ah, forget about it, get out of here, get your fucking shinebox, and I think that's true of most of these people, but it is not true, the Khive, I think the Kive would actually not only not vote for Biden, but some of them might try to take a shot at him, because they are the people who have essentially become identity politics wahabists where they have, they have gathered all of their meaning like the the good and evil and their personal investment in politics, their identity as a political agent as someone trying to shape their lives and destinies and the future of their families and their species around a very specific ideological matrix around which with with with brittle to non-existent ideology under underlying it, and as such they're not going to take, that's that's the one thing that will make them, the thing they, i mean they might have told everyone else, hey suck it up, this is beating trump is too important. but I think for a small group of them uh they would actually do some puma shit if she didn't get it, but from the point of view of I'm Biden uh, these are an insignificant number of people uh, and Harris I think honestly would be a bad pick, I mean not only, I think it'd be funny if he didn't pick her, but I also think he could do better, like that Karen Bass or something, I honestly now, I'm kind of now of the opinion that like a relatively unknown uh black female congress woman would be the best pick because it would be something people could talk about that wasn't. Trump or Biden, because they're stuck in a thing where you want to be able to define yourself, you need to have some sort of positive uh, you know, shape to your campaign, you can't completely rely on your opponent shitting the bed, I mean you can mostly do it, but and you can try to do it, but there, I think people assume there are limits, and I think people are going to act with the assumption that there are limits to that, and so you want to have something positive to talk about your campaign, and like if they roll out, hey, meet this... person and it's somebody who basically nobody had heard about a week ago, becoming an overnight celebrity, that's the kind of thing that could actually hold a new cycle or too, i mean i don't think it will given how the creesenard. of of sensory overload we live in, but it could certainly more than him picking Kamala Harris, old news, she ran boo, it's all, immediately they go to oh, what about the time of the debate they they fought, and all the all that tedious shit, and what about her being a cop, you don't gain anything, it's just another, it's it's somebody's already out he's been in the deck, brought back out, oh yeah, we know that boo, you got to bring in someone new, someone flashy, somebody to get people going, get the people moving, and like with Trump being the nominee, with Biden being the avatar of of Wall Street uh experience if not competences and sure people know that his brain's melting, but at least they don't think that he's not you know that that he doesn't know how to where the fucking bathroom is and that kind of thing just in term unless he's forgotten, so I don't think there's any real danger of people being like, oh she's she's not very qualified, I mean who's president for Christ sake? I think it immediately becomes here's a new person, and so many people can form belief. around, people they can make memes over, a way to sort of launder this dog shit dead carcass of a campaign into something animated, so yeah, fuck it, Karen Bass, go for it, val Denning, somebody like that, whoever you think is like gonna get whoever's get him in front of as a focus group and whoever lights up the dials most pick, just something to talk about that isn't biden, that isn't Biden's man, I mean my god, you guys saw. I hope everyone saw him today, the best, one of his best moments yet of the campaign where he had everything in him, everything in it that is bad, everything that is that is evidence of his manifest mental incompetence in one minute long uh segment, let me play it right now, if anybody hasn't heard it, this is genuinely amazing, vice president, your opponent in this election, president Trump has made your mental state a campaign topic and when asked in June if you've been tested um for cognitive decline you've responded that you're constantly tested in constantly he's got guys are coming at him he's got to do judo chops he's got to evade attackers just got to do mind combat here we go why the hell would i take a test come on man come on man that's like saying you before you got in this program if you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not what do you think huh? are you a junky are you a junky to president Trump are you a junky brags about his and makes you an issue for voters ah hell god damn it oh well if he can't figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion i don't know what the hell he's talking about did you watch that look come on man i i know you're trying to goad me but i mean i'm so forward to looking to have i'm so forward to looking to sit with the president sit to or stand with or either one, whatever we want to do it, here it is, this is my favorite part, i i shouldn't say it, i'm gna say i probably shouldn't say, i am uh, i am very willing to let the American public judge my physical and mental fil, my physical as well as my mental fitness, he botches physical and mental fitness twice in a row like he's a fucking studbaker, you try to start, you couldn't write it better, he is funnier than Trump at this point, because Trump kind of get it, get him in there, get get the new funniest possible thing, by Felix is once again a correct, he truly is a shaman, he just feels the vibrations, I'm out here trying to piece this shit together with like these stupid specific concepts and and and symbolic orders and he's just like, he's reading the wind, he's like his his knee cap starts twitching and he understands the the direction of the cosmic winds, but yeah, funniest outcome, because we're in a period of disruption and and comedy comes from surprise, from the unexpected, and we we are living in an era of extrapolating and and compounding uh uh shocks to the system, so of course it's going to be funny, and now this is who we get to be as president for anywhere from uh, I'm gonna say uh, 18 to uh, I think he might make it. i think the over-under on should be should he make it past the mid-terms, although maybe he'll keep living, maybe he is going to be one of those old guys whose lights go out, but he stays alive for for years, god that'd be a nightmare, but also in its own horrifying way, kind of funny, come on man, physical mental filt, physical mental filt. fitness, the goddamn beyond everything that tom, goddamn beyond everything, well i mean they worship senility because they're seeing now the elector is old people, they want to see themselves represented, like Trump is them, so's Biden, just different versions, the ones who are accepting their decline and the ones who are raging against the dying of the light, but it's still the same group, same old people watching tv, and they're picking which type of, which one of these old fucks they relate to more? someone ask if Nixon in 60 if he'd won if it would have changed the uh it would have prevented the the the southern realignment uh the racial realignment. uh and on civil rights and i got to say i don't think so uh nixon wasn't like a was certainly wasn't a civil rights uh like fire brand in any way uh the real interesting thing is that the interesting question about civil rights is how to what to what such a to what a massive degree the assassination of jfk broke a log jam there that might otherwise have not been defeated and and it raises a question of like absent that how do you buse the Kennedis had no idea how to deal with those old crackers in congress who were bottling it up using all the procedural tricks they learned from generations at the cracker barrel your your your Howard Smiths and your Richard Russell's they were eating their fucking lunch and Johnson had an idea but they didn't want to hear that fucking dip shit they hated him they they had all the Harvard degrees so they they knew it was better and they were just absolutely buffalowed and it was the assassination of Kennedy that kind of broke the log jam on civil rights. and of course you wouldn't, I mean if Nixon's president, you still have the southerners resisting, I don't know, I don't know how you get out of the log jam, I, I had a fun idea for a counterfactual history there where Kennedy, Nixon wins, right, and um, when the human miss, when uh, the bay of pigs happens, see the thing with Kennedy was, Kennedy was essentially in the dark about about the Bay of pigs. when he came in, they said we've got an operation to defeat uh, to go in and knock over Castro, easy peasy with a with an army, like we did in Guatimala, it'll be no sweat, and Kennedy basically said, all right, go for it, and the planners created a uh, a plan that really could only have any chance of working with us military air intervention, it was not going to be feasible for them to actually, I mean in in in the deluged halls of power some of these guys. some of these guys, maybe even wisener, I'm not sure believed, oh as soon as they show up the masses will rise up and overthrow Castro, but the more hardheted realists knew that that the cuban uh, you know, the response was robust enough that without air support to stop the moving in of heavy weapons to repel the invasion, they were not going to make it, uh, and but they didn't tell Kennedy that because they didn't want him to say, no, they were operating off the better to ask. for forgiveness then permission model, thinking that, well if we start this thing and it goes south, he's going to be pot committed and he's going to say go for it, which of course that's a bad way to go about planning a thing, uh, and sure enough, when it came time for the invasion, it was getting repelled, and they say, hey, uh, so we could really could use some air support, and Kennedy said, fuck no, what was air support, I thought this was going to be easy and and deniable, uh, and and then he made. the the laudable choice to just cut bait then and there, of course, some could say that's where his death wrent was signed, depending on your view on it, as I said, I have at this point after reading about it a lot, I am agnostic, uh, it just feels good, I feel I like floating in that the liminal JFK space, just like in a jacuzzi of what ifs, possibilities and conjectures without any kind of solidified consensus, uh, I like just knowing all that stuff and and just letting it flow around me instead of hardening into pres prepositions. and suppositions, but Nixon on the other hand, was the person at the White House who was the point man for the planning for the Bay of Pigs invasion, which had started under Eisenhower. Bay of pigs were already under uh, was already being planned before the election and Nixon as VP was directing it. It's easy to imagine a conterfactual where Nixon's president. and is more invested in Bay of pigs at an operational level and more committed to the concept of it, so that if he was in charge when the invasion happens, not only does he authorize air strikes, they're already baked into the plan because he's he's signed off on the concept or even if not that when they ask him he gives the green light because he's just he believes he has ownership more of it, he feels like it's his thing, i mean a big part of it with Kennedy is they just stuff that in his face and he said what i'm on the hook for something that i didn't even authorized and that's one of the big reasons he didn't want to uh commit too much, this was Nixon's baby. and so what if there's a successful incursion that you know gets past the beachhead at the biabit cuchino and it stalls out and the next step is an investment of us uh boots on the ground and instead of Vietnam in the late 60s you have Cuba in the early 60s, and with a hardening of social of a a social conflict excel rating uh, in the absence of a civil rights resolution, you have a a more violent and more uh chaotic and and and polarizing even than in reality civil rights movement uh and ani war movement, i don't know, just messing around with a little bit, i have no idea, but the other thing is is that Nixon was also. you know a triangulator and he was a pragmatist so there's a question of you know he would he have been the guy who tamped down cold war tensions after all he was the guy who I mean Kennedy ran to his right on China and on uh on missiles but the thing is I think guys like Kent Nixon kind of view great power shit like the stuff between the big guys on a different level than things like knocking over some tinpot dictator. and at that point remember castro had just taken power, he was not this fixture in human society, he was an arrivist, knocking that guy off, i don't think he necessarily would have considered it like terribly, especially in our own backyard, i don't think he necessarily would have considered it a a huge provocation to the soviets, just keeping your house in order. but yeah, I always imagine then like, so Nixon's term is just like this hyperreactionary turn, and then he has George Wallis as his running mate in 1966, 64, why some somebody keeps asking me about the social network, and I got to say that's a movie that I have very few opinions on, I never really got it, I watched it in the theater at the time it came out and I thought, okay, and it's never, it's never been a favorite of mine, but i i it's got stuff that's okay in it, i don't know, the fixation on it either is either really good or really bad, i don't really get, someone says Oliver stone's w is good, i i have to disagree on that one, that is a... That is a terrible film in my opinion, it's essentially a bunch of a bunch of filmed daily cost articles from 2004. I have I guess I have one ques I guess people are ask people someone asked me about the about the Weger deal and I know a lot of people say like the whole thing is an op it's all like a CIA operation to provoke a new cold war and I certainly buy the logic the the political logic anyway of a new cold war but as I understand you know as I said I I think the that real conflict between the United States and China is is due to short-sitedness and and uh just - ability to to kind of smooth out some of the uh some of the inherent bumps in transitioning to like a globalized supply chain uh and and are kind of from a market perspective not terribly rational, but in the short term there's in both countries there's i think significant political capital to be garnered from an escalating cold war. the thing i don't get is at this late date, i mean who the fuck cares about human rights? I mean I get yeah Iraq war right yeah like that was the big liberal intervention right uh that was the big uh that that was saving Iraq and the poor Kurds from the from the from poison and stuff I mean Trump ran on fuck the rest of the world we'll shoot whoever we want built like everyone's been freaking out about cages on the border for four years nothing's been done about them. why the who what vanishingly small percentage of people gives a shit in this country about any anybody's human rights including their own fucking uh fellow citizens and i get oh it's for the it's for the NGO crowd it's for the NGO crowd it's for the journalists I'm sorry if you still think those people are shaping opinions I mean if it is an op it's a it's it's one of the lowest uh return ops. i can imagine, that's all, i don't know, i mean it, trump's on the record, when when when G explained to him what they were doing with the weigers, he said, that's a great idea, that's what you should be doing, somebody asked an interesting question, somebody said what about film under communism? obviously this is an absurd question because i mean talk about uh missing the forest for the trees you know we're pretty far away from from anything other than galloping disaster in every direction, silly to talk about something as pie in the sky as that, but I think it's an interesting idea just cuuse I talk a lot about you, how art is warped over time by capitalism, and what would that look like in its absence? And part of me thinks, I mean i so you've got the simple fact that. is accelerated to such an extent that the ability to like make something a film specifically will be democratized presumably buse the technology to the the actual the actual material necessary to make uh to make a movie is distributed. but the thing is if anybody can make a movie then which one should i see and like that's where the market comes in as like these the creator of a a gatekeeping effect which people hate gate keepers but i'm sorry certain things certain iesthetics require gate peeping or else people are never going to be able to engage with any kind of art form uh productively because they're not going to be able to seek things out cuz how are they supposed to know what even starts being good you know and that's the market used to stand in, like what people could get money for is what was good, and of course that's bad, that's a bad rubric and it's distorting, but it also does create the capacity to make large scale entertainments that are genuinely engaging, and it's hard to imagine the something in the absence of that, and i i kind of think there would be sort of a a two-tiered filmmaking the way there is now, uh, but instead of around high and low budget, it would be like local, like i could honestly imagine like movie making becoming a regional. production like a collaborative thing from like communities or or or areas you know where people come together to do something and then they all watch it together uh and then like that's where and and then the the selection process becomes who you actually made the movie with you know and it's not just seeing the thing it's making the thing like the like local theater exactly uh but you know there's still a limit there to scale and grandiosity that who would want to lose that you know and uh Then I would imagine it would have to be some, you'd need some sort of gatekeeping operation to accumulate a coordinate action really and and and uh accumulate the material. the the the capital to make it, not capital, but whatever, the the human and material resources, maybe it'd be democratic, maybe people would like pitch their ideas, people would vote on them. "Once upon a time in Hollywood was the last great movie, someone says, I will say this, I'd say once upon a time in Hollywood was the last movie, it was a great movie uh, and I think it's it, but I think you could even say it might be like the last movie, we'll see, but it might mark the end of an entire type type of filmmaking, which considering it." subject matter is just so perfect that i kind of want it to be true even if it's not cuz it's so tidy. someone's asking for sound drops, i think we might be able to get that in the future, if we move to the studio like i'm hoping we can do soon, i would like to get some sound drops and maybe a sound board of some kind, get a little zow. Oh uh, someone says people will put sound drops in, nothing that anyone, none of you people can do, no, no, no, no, no, I will control them, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, surely, you can't be serious, allowing, allowing the ground links, no, no, no, no, just the soundboard for me where I get to press buttons and make funny noises. Ah, geogser, that's a good idea, I would do a geogster stream, I'm not very good at that game, but it could be fun, I'm usually not that good at it because my computer was kind of slow and it was it take too long to like get to the identifying stuff and I would lose patience, but maybe I could take more seriously, children men's great, one of the best movies of the 21st century for sure. Marats are clerics, i actually say marats, marats is a solid movie all around, it's an actual kind of movie, i like clerk a lot honestly, i mean it was formational as a kid, but uh, i think mal rats was really good, a lot of you people ask me for my takes on things, but you're you put the you put it in a very leading way where you clearly want me to confirm your take on something, that's very clever, i see you doing it though, don't think i don't see it, cheeky monkeys, thoughts on how i'm cool. uh, I don't smoke, someone's asking me, I have smoked cigarettes, I've never smoked, come from a family of smokers, hardcore smokers, never liked it. sir, all right, the sarah cooper thing, so there was an article today in Mick about or Mike, I don't know about how boomers love the Sarah Cooper Limp videos, but millennials and zoomers think that it's it's it's laundering fascism or something, and I, I didn't read it, but just the fact that it was phrased that way, it just, it was disheartening because it reminded me of how how because culture, because politics is so fully fused with popular culture and entertainment uh that you can't not like anything now for non-political reasons, like if a thing is bad it has to be politically bad, it can't just suck, and this lips, the fucking lipsink lady sucks, it's it's very very bad, maybe one video is kind of funny, but doing it again and again, it's absolutely baffling, and not since Eric Garland had the fucking uh game theory tweet get retweeted by a bunch of people founding over it, have i been more baffled by seeing people, including some people that i have somewhat some kind of respect for, going this is so funny, i just like, what, what, where does that come from? and the thing is, it's not, it's not because it launders, oh, it's like it, it makes, it makes Trump's fascism clownish, like i'm sorry if you can't see the clownishness of this situation, or the degree to which clownishness is inherent and fascism and you can't really be teased out, and also like, what's the bad what's the bad part about this? like you see her do the lip sinking and you're like, oh, i was going to overthrow capitalism or whatever, but now i'm i'm just going to laugh at this video, huh, what is that i thought here? it's a lady doing a lip sink of trump, that's all it is, it's it, it's lame, what, why? i don't know anything about hasan being called by the end. say why what do you want me to say? please don't yell at me in the chat. until i have someone reading these i have to like do it myself and it just it's it's enervating to be assaulted with in news and demands for takes in in large print over and over again. i mean i think if people want. obviously all the shit with antifa and the government like calling it a terrorist organization and and investigating people out is fucked up, but goddamn it, it would be easier to high fighted a fewer people acted like that was a real thing too, it act like antifa's real, like that it's an actual group of people and it has leadership and that any of that shit is true. i mean, when you see this shit happened with antiifa, it really clarifies the whole like power of nightmares thesis about Al-Qaeda that it was essentially made up. by the Bush administration that it never really existed in any form that people popularly understood it to according to what they saw in the media and and you know it took while for people to realize that because they didn't have the context of you know middle eastern politics and terrorism and stuff to realize oh this guy was basically just giving out grants there was no real uh internal organization here it wasn't like spectra or something and like with Anifa that's a thing that i you know is have is something people have understanding of and is happens like they've seen it. they've seen the the phenomena in their lives and they know it's not real, and yet some people like Al-Qaeda like being called real, like Alcaeda, they they got off uh when when when... bush turn them into this this evil organization and i think there's a similar impulse to be like yeah we are this thing like buse that's going to raise you up but then what look what it's used to do it's used to justify spurrious fucking federal investigations and crackdowns Jake Paul having his mansion rated, man, hell of a day, uh, that was a, that was a whole squad, is he, is he starting a militia? I think that would really be cool if he was starting a milicia. Someone wants to me to tell them if Bizmark or Meternick were worse, that's a bad word to use. when you're talking about historical figures, that that that axes of of moral judgment applies to them internally, but is relatively irrelevant to my analysis of them from history, from the from the from decades away. I mean, Bismark did help unify Germany more directly, and unify Germany was a very bad idea, but at the same time nobody really knew what it was going to lead to, nobody knew with all those... i mean i guess it just i what what uh trait are you trying to examine like personal morality or morality i think that's kind of irrelevant like what effects are you trying to determine and and then like the question should be built around that because i just don't know how to answer like good or bad for bad like evil people honestly even when they talk about like evils dictator or whatever like, oh he killed 20 million people, he killed 30 million people, it's like, well yeah, but if you switched them, it probably would have been different numbers, so one of the big reasons, I've never been down on the idea that of James B. Canon is the worst president, because if you'd switched him in Franklin Pierce, they would have had the exact same presidenties basically, because they came from the exact same dough faced conciliatory, northern democratic tradition, they were upholding the same at that point, no longer sustainable, but still delusionally held by people at the highest levels of government, democratic. uh northern bargain of giving the south whatever they want to keep keep the peace, and that's what Bucan was doing, I mean we look back on it and people call him a traitor for just giving up all those armories and forts uh to to the insurgents, but Peerce would have done it too, that was giving shit to the fucking southerners to keep them quiet was what northern democrats did to keep power, so to me they're interchangeable, same thing with all the evil dictators, like it's the the resources and populations that they controlled dictated how many people they killed, uh uh, yeah, and if you want to talk about like competent, i mean meternick got driven out of uh give griven out of Vienna by by a mob, but bismark never had that happen, why did i say that my fans betrayed me? i don't i don't think i did, if i did that might have been a joke, i don't think i ever said that seriously, it'd be a weird thing to say, if i said that that would be disturbed me because it means i'm in some sort of a megalical fugue. uh, i think Omar will win, i i honestly i don't, i think people are just kind of flinching. so much like I think people thought that uh Rashida was in more trouble than she probably ever was because they're just uh they're used to getting their asses kicked but the thing about like high profile congressmen is they tend to be popular unless they get unless they're popular for unless they get in trouble for like specific stuff that is uh antithetical to the base the party base that they have like having name recognition is a huge percentage of the battle for any congressman, as soon as you have a certain amount of of like uh real estate and people know you in a district, you don't really lose ever, and uh getting a high profile early is a good way to have that get uh have that process accelerate and the stuff that people think is like awful for Omar or whatever, I don't think actual people in that district give a shit. I think that uh for a long time like the the the whole zionist uh apparatus had the ability to sort of sneak in their agenda as like a parcel of other. is that and their shit kind of just got put in without being considered, and now the people are actually directly challenging it, they have to defend it on the merits and try to provoke conflict uh on the issues themselves, which basically bail down to allowing Israel to do whatever it wants, and it's nightmare apartide state, and Americans don't care enough to like do anything to stop us from contributing to that, but they also don't care enough to vote for somebody who's opposed to it, and I think that's what the that's what. being slowly and horrifyingly understood in the halls of power is that oh shit like if if this is if this is no longer just a situation where there is an exercised minority who love Israel and everyone else kind of doesn't care uh if there's even you know a residual uh support for uh confronting Israel it's going to be hard to dislodge because how the hell do you argue that as own discrete issue, yeah, exactly, apathy works both ways, like apathy's why we're not going to get a change to us policy in Israel, but elpathy is also why if you have a few brave congress people who are willing to not to the line on Israel, it's harder for Israel to, if they don't have anything else uh that's controversial, pin that on them as a reason for them to be voted out by their own uh constituents who they other otherwise might like and respect them. All right, I'm gonna ask uh, gonna log off in a second here, one more question guys, I'm gonna, I'm gonna crack another lacrois. All right, this is a good question, best SNL weekend uh update anchor, the obvious hipster answer is Nor McDonald, so I'm not even going to say that because it's too on the nose, uh, I'm just going to go with my uh, my childhood gut with a guy I used to really really like, and not bause he was fun. because he used to make me feel smart, because if i got the reference i felt like a little good boy because i was a fucking insufferable nerd, dennis motherfucking miller, respect, respect to the god, colin Quinn, got to be worst, him and charles rocket probably, but oh my god, colin Quinn was terrible, just the worst person they could have picked for that job, they clearly like panicked after uh, norm got fired and just it's almost like they grabbed him from like drinking like a short dog with fingerless gloves in front of the 30 rock and put him on put him on the set, it was kind of amazing, just mutterring his way, stumbling through every joke, it was amazing, all right guys, i'm peacing out, see you tomorrow hopefully.
