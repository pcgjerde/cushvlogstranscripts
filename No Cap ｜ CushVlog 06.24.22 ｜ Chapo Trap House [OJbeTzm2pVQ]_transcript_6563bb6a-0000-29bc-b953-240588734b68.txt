 how does it feel to treat me like you do? i'm a hip in the harbor and i'll tell you who you are, i'll say how does it feel? how does it feel? to treat me like you do, how does it feel, how how does it feel, it how does it feel, how how does it feel? i don't really know the words to that song, sorry beyond the very very catchy um chorus there. Well, it is a historic day in America where uh, a rubicon that many people thought would never be crossed, as a fact, officially, even though we all knew it was coming, they kind of soften it up, uh, and honestly uh, the on the theory that makes sense to me about who leaked the thing uh, is that it was one of the conservatives. for the very purpose of staggering the horror here, so instead of it being an announcement, yeah, we broke through, we did this, we have severed this connection, we have uh, we've cut this social gourdian not, we we've done it, and have everyone have to process that like instantaneously, they figured that just, if their goal is to allow this to be metabolized without an uh unacceptable amount of blowback uh, it's in their interest to stagger that reaction, so you get two days, two little bursts of horror, instead of one, maybe bigger one, now of course, not saying that that would have led to anything meaningful happening, but if you've got the option, and if you're there sitting on the fucking uh, if you're sitting at the Supreme Court, you're one of those disgusting federalist society. goblins who clerk for these people or you're one of the demons in robes themselves, one of the arcons themselves, you have the option of letting it all go up on one day, or you uh, you prep the ground a little bit, see what's going to happen, like oh, how much response really inmerges? oh, look at this, there's basically nothing, you know, uh, it's it's it's more way more useful, i mean, I could see maybe a liberal insanely uh releasing it thinking, oh everyone will be so horrified that they'll be scared into uh backing down, and you know, I guess it comes down to do you think that uh, the person who leaks a document like that is more likely to be fucking stupid or evil, of course in the browder sense all these people are evil, they're up holding an evil institution. I'm talking about their... their self-conception, like do they adhere to a model of virtue that is been propagated now by like the political economic model of contemporary technological capitalism that we live in, there is a like a model of citizenship, there is a model of uh of political virtues uh that adhere to. principles and I've talked before about how you know marxism is part of this tradition like like the the emergence of like liberal uh concepts of right uh are key to unlocking the um the like class consciousness of the workers, if you don't have those notions of like liberal right, you can't organize your alienation politically. It's the language you speak of the alienation and and and the liberal subjectivity that you're being forced into by living in a capitalist mode of production, is liberal, now that's not to mean that if you get communism, we're all going to stay little liberal subjects forever, the process of fighting for it, transforms social relations, transforms our values, destroys sentimentality and replaces it with like real solitaristic uh uh social like consciousness and that's the hardest thing to talk about when you're trying to uh you know sketch out um the contours of of ideological difference is that the process of like making socialism is an action, it is not a thought, but right now everybody who adheres to socialism is only thinking, there is no practice, no meaning like rubber hits the ground, you have to make life or death decisions practice, that's people don't live making life or death decisions every day, i'm saying that they are not doing it as part of a organized, structured class-based project, the thing that makes effort reinforce, that that reinforces your efforts, instead of letting them be diffused and absorbed and and sublimated, and so that's why you have this uh idiot confusion where people, some people, idiots, people who are trying to have ulterior motive. that are just trying to convince themselves that they're making the right decision uh look at liberal subjectivity and say oh look the fact that capitalism is liberal means that uh the opposite is uh marxist like the the crudest like uh blood and soil reactionary uh identity categories that uphold capitalism are right because that's the socially capitalism and so now because capitalism has gone way past its historic uh cell by date like for and this is why like capitalism is progressive to a point and then it just becomes destructive and we've been in that point for a very long time now but that liberal subjectivity keeps creating like the values that end up being organized around uh, like the broader liberal and socialist critique of modern life, and there is an alternative value system, and I will say that it is one that looks at the evils of capitalism, the evils of hierarchy that capitalism is created to sustain. and makes them good. now I'm not saying that the people who believe this stuff are necessarily evil, because they're not making a choice anymore than any of us are to adhere to a set of cultural values, they are largely imprinted upon us. and so at the level of Supreme Court uh clerics you've got, yeah, sure, they're both evil, but one of them thinks themselves to be good in the sense that we understand it, speaking through the the understood language of individual autonomy, individual freedom, rights, the market, property, all that stuff that's built on top of like the real machinery of exploitation, and that is superstructural, but which actually like the mindset and value system of people within it, namely liberals, within the system, liberals, because if you're not a liberal, you're not in the system, you will get spit out, so you got at that level, you got this evil person who thinks they're good, we understand those terms, and then you've got an evil person who knows they evil and thinks that that is good, now that's manatian. but it's less so and you remember that we're not talking about like the uh like defining characteristics of human beings, like we're not saying people are evil, we're saying that you have to identify not just the structure of capitalism, but also it's supporting superstructures that reinforce it. and I'm sorry, all those traditional values are all part of that set of uh support structures and what they're supporting is now. this this localized extraction and real estate, the remnant, the literal remnant of the landbased social order the capitalism supplanted, the last bearins, we've talked about this before, the last true aristocrats, as in people who own their wealth, not to financial abstractions that flow across the globe in an endless invisible sea and could never really be uh held, they hold land, they hold what is underneath land. they hold the labor of others, they hold those things and they're still able, and yes, they are at the mercy of these global flows, and the fact that they are is what drives them insane, because they understand that they are fundamentally not free in the way they imagine themselves to be, and that's what drives their neurotic pursuit of the death drive, through the expression of the annihilatory politics of fascism. and again it's not like the the version of these liberal uh values that we get from liberal society are bad, they're racially essentialist in their own way, they uh, they are as dedicated and their own way, practically in the day-to-day to the maintenance of capitalism. but in them is the seed of the next thing, it's the next form of consciousness that has to emerge, if humans are going to put take on the machine. if you cannot have solidarity across racial gender lines, if the multiplicity of like humans under liberal freedom cannot be uh recognized, then you can't have sufficient organization to overthrow capitalism, you will be defeated, you will either be absorbed into the thing itself, or isolated and annihilated, those are your options. just ask the strasser brothers, if you're defending capitalism in crisis, like a land-based feudal remnant capitalism, extractive capitalism, call it, rather than circulatory capitalism, which of course again, they're totally connected to one another. but it's a it's a can, it's like a fucking tumor, it doesn't recognize the body as itself, because it's been too traumatized, not by uh economic insecurity, economic uh uh, what's the word they always use sarcastically, economic anxiety, not really, not in the real true sense, but psychically, yes, the position of precarity, when you're supposed to be at the top of a hierarchy, and there's someone above you that is alien to you. and that you can't defeat, that drives you crazy, and that is what our American and worldwide small bourgeois are doing, they're going fucking insane, and the liberals are going insane too, because they're trying to adhere to this politics of liberation that only makes everything worse for everyone, and so instead of imagining a future, an emancipatory future, they imagine a sadistic uh fantasy of punishment for those they think are responsible, only instead of it being the other, it's the... selves in the mirror, it's whatever they most hate about themselves and what makes them adherent to that system instead of fighting against it, it's their whiteness, it's their maleness, whatever, and that gets turned into a fucking totem, and anybody wants to stand behind that banner gets eliminated. now of course, what's really happening is is that poor people are just being fed a thresher, no matter who's in charge, but the order they get put in changes depending on the political uh machine, these two insane skitzoid... halves of the bourgeois psychey and people want to say why the hell are the democrats like this and i think and i understand they're herrible the they're awful it's it's a joke it's a joke of a party but i think people who want them to be more confrontational you know like do things like for example like throw trump in jail you know uh uh tell the supreme court to fuck off or like uh uh they say like why are you adhering to these institutions why do you have this? because the institutions are what they actually believe in, they don't believe in being in charge, in fact they don't want to be in charge because they know the machine is a murder machine and they imagine themselves good, remember these people want an excuse to not be responsible for what the machine is doing, so they adhered to these norms to as as the buffer between them and responsibility. "the other side doesn't care about that, because they have taken responsibility, in fact they want to take responsibility, they want their politics to be a ritual affirmation of the virtue" of destroying the weak, so if liberals really were to push the way that people are yelling at them too, they know in their minds if they can't say it out loud that if they decide we're not adhearing to norms and therefore there's no remaining benefit to keeping us around to keep things smoothly moving, because now we can't assure ourselves of our dominion over you, then it's over, then they will just all of them including all of the good ones who convince themselves they're doing what they have to do, the leading spear of the pussy uh vasillators, but the hardcore is going to say, yeah, the people who actually have guns in this fucking country, the people who actually pull triggers and not, i'm not talking about the 5% of dipshits in this country who own half the guns, you know it's it's it's like 3% of the population owns half the guns, it's like they're like fucking funko pops, that's all they are, and it makes sense because the gun is just the... consumer ritual uh symbol for your lost yoman liberty that you fetishize, you think you're a yoman, even though everything around you shows that you have no self-sufficiency, no control over your life, but you've got a gun and that means that if they come for the rest of it, even though it's all shit and you're miserable, if they try to come for your like uh crum of of pleasure, they'll fucking shoot you. and they know that if they fight you they'll win, so that's why they're not afraid of it going there. the thing I want to ask everybody who wants the democrats to pursue a maximally confrontational position visa v norms. I mean, it's fuutile anyway because they're not going to do it and there's nothing you can say to make them, but I'm just saying theoretically, I think those people because it might help them redirect their actions in their lives, because my god everything seems so terrible and nobody knows what to do. hey, maybe you could see what's in front of you more if you weren't freaking out. do you have the horses for that? so whatever you're fantasizing about, your best case scenario of like resistance, ask yourself. do you have the fucking horses for that? as Tom Wilkinson said in Michael Clayton, you think you have the horses for that? because they will escalate. I know people say they don't care about norms, but they are not just in charge now, you know, like if they really didn't care about, like I don't understand this, the democrats will say that like the coo almost happened, like this thing almost occurred, my god, we almost had an overthrow, why? didn't we? because they decided not to. that was it. the center of gravity of like capital and its cultural superstructure, the ball of shit, the human fecies that gravitate around it. uh, they have no. respect for the norms, they like them to the degree that they keep you at arms length, and so if there is some breach of norms, it will be like, okay, you told us, because the center of gravity of the rights decided, no, we're not going to let Trump do this, even though they could have, they really could have, one of the big reasons they decided. is because they trusted that the democrats would keep playing along, like people have asked, like what if it was Trump versus Bernie instead of Trump versus uh Biden, what happens then, and it wouldn't be because of Trump's brilliant cou, it would have been because of the actions of democrats, and so that means you know, wait, but get the horses, man, you need to get the horses, you got to get the team set up before you even think about trying to escalate, and so that means I would like to hear less people talking in maximalist terms and more people uh, doing their uh response at a more intimate level. I guess uh, saying stuff that for one way or another, uh, if you thought it really mattered, you wouldn't make public. Let's put it that way, because that is the main thing that makes me... discount uh the valid the ability of like you know the left is in like leftist people with of a left this social affected like uh adherence and side uh like do you have uh what it takes to get something out of a raising of the stakes I guess I'd say. because hey, if you want to go down fighting and cleanse yourself of responsibility, you can, but it's really at that point, isn't it about ego then? isn't it just the death drive of itself? if is it just the mirror image of the fascist? it's just fuck it, let's be legends. now people say john brown, uh, i don't know, you can disagree with me, but i i don't know how you can look at the last 20 years of America. american life and say that um spectacular acts of violence can be meaningful uh shapers of like social life like have a sustained impact on uh like the the the balance of powers like the war of position between the sides that you're supposed to be fighting the send i know and the thing is like what is the site? i don't know the site, that's where i have to cop cop out, i mean i'd say the workplace, see someone says like a defeatist i don't want to spend my juice spouting off on here, i don't want to spend any anamo i have accidentally, i don't want to dump my orgone into fantasies. because that's it at the end of the day it robs you, it does, it robs you of your essence, but I mean take heart here, like if you if you do have faith in your fellow citizens, like enough of them that if called to the moment would rise to the occasion, if you believe that, and this is what it boils down to, right, do you think that there is that group of people or not? whereas right now you can't see them because they are not organized, they are not disciplined, they are not shaped in any way, they're protein, that doesn't mean they're not active, that doesn't mean they're not on a path, it means that identifying the specific formation is almost impossible, because the level that you that you're talking about, the national level is a baren wasteland has been rendered so has been irradiated basically by the fucking... atomic bomb of the internet, but i mean my god if you can support strikes, do it, fuck, if you if if at the local level there are like candidates for city office, people who like control budgets, like who actually gets to hold guns for example, you know uh That's certainly worth doing, but like if if you come to it from the imperial, the wasteland, the saron eye that we're all glancing through to try to talk to ourselves in a legible language, because that's the thing, we want to communicate with like this hive mind, and we can only do that if we're talking about common reference points, which are by definition, deterritorialized, they're pulled from their local context, they're sterilized and turned into just - fuel for arguments, i'm going to put up, i'm going to put up some signage, i'm going to put up my uh my posters, don't worry about it or my portraits, and like the answer to like what to do is it's like you know. uh, it's like the ghostbusters Pke meter where they're like trying to find ghost vibes, if you do something and it makes that sense of hopelessness and anxiety that everybody talks about all the time that they're feel trapped by, if it makes it go away a little bit, it might be the right thing to do, if it intensifies it, but like you find yourself enraptured by the intensity, then you might have just replaced one fix for another, but again, that only comes from a personal experience rooted in a time and place that I can't speak to, that sucks, but it's all I have, and if I try to, if I start trying to. reason myself away from that to indulge myself or anybody else, i'm going to just i'm going to lose the sense of uh of that that i have now, like what i'm talking about, the feeling i'm talking about is the feeling i have right now, and you might say, oh, that's easy for you to see, you're posting, you know, you're doing internet bullshit, it's like right, but that's also my job, you know, that's not very many people's job. most people have different jobs and the big problem is you got people whose jobs are dependent on this this pleasure coming at an abstract level that they're going to be incentivized to get others to think that way too, like this the real trap at the at the at the center of the entire project of trying to uh organize a left online, which is all we've been doing since Bernie and all we have been able to do, think of this white, room is my mind cube so for me it comes down to do people like it enough people do people keep wanting to hear me then it beats dig and ditches and i have time to do other things that means i got to be able to take the hit on you are being a uh you're saying exactly uh what you need to hear to avoid. like really doing something, and it's like, yeah, that's probably true, that's why you shouldn't listen, people like us about everything, but you know, everybody is a cybernetic being and they have to spend time online, and so the question is, what are they going to spend it on, you know, and what's maddening is is that we can't know, because like we're all waiting for some moment of truth, and like the good news is those are real. the bad news is uh, it's not like there's one moment of truth, every moment is a moment of truth, it's just whether it degree to the degree, it ends up being retrospectively like a hinge point to your life, and that means you can't know you're in the um, at the moment of truth, um, when it happens, unless you assume as it's happening that every moment is the moment of truth. so that's what you got to do, you got to act like every moment is the moment of truth, because it's not about what your uh opinions are on all the topics of the day, the matter is what is what are you valuing when you interact with the world and have to make choices? i know this is all god, i hear it coming out and i'm like, i can understand absolutely. this bullshit, but here i stand, i could do no other, i know it's a fucking cop out, but like you know, at a certain at a certain level you have to assume the universe is benevolent, it's the only way for anything else to make sense, and yes it is as hell, i i would say technically artisanal, but basically yeah, certainly not the type of uh subjectivity that socialist struggle will build. makes sense because I've never really carried out any socialist struggle, I've never gone out on strike, like I've interacted with uh, you know, uh, volunteer organizations, but that at a certain level is is not where the rubber meets the road, because of the voluntear aspect, one of the things that shapes movements towards uh effectiveness is necessity, in fact it's the thing. It's the darwinian accelerator, so it's a grim state of affairs, certainly, where, how did we get here, we might ask ourselves if we were david Burt, we might ask ourselves, how did we get here and our friends uh uh panich and uh uh Gidlin I believe are answering that question in their book the making of global capitalism look at that look at that fucking segway look at me just ease into this material so we are now at the stage when according to uh this book we go from a global capitalist system being nit into like a structure to one that uh becomes like fully realized the tipping point basically where a a alternative models can no longer stand against it, like during the cold war you had this real balance of forces and it wasn't just between communism and capitalism, it was also like just uh like the indigenous bourgeois arising in the uh recently uh colonized world like that's its own like you have class formation happening at like this geometric rate in the former they're all contending and it's contending over resources and over over building a technological social machine capable of self-defense, and this is when union happens, the western left is buck broken, the... the insurgent political tides in the rest of the world are just assassinated and coughed and bombed out of existence. that leads to the situation where we now have a fully realized global capitalism, not one force among forces contesting over the space, the global space, but a domint a fully uh fully dominated one uh and so these chapters are telling that story, which is a story of uh breaking the left at home and abroad basically, and then re-imposing a a new uh deal basically between labor and capitalism that would uh replace uh waged demands, shares of profit or uh like claims of profit, social claims of profit uh with uh borrow money with credit, basically, a further uh, immiseration, right, you take the land away from the peasant so that all they can sell is time in exchange for money and like have that relationship like form a psychic bond, like he's alienated, but the more money he makes, the less alienated he feels, right? because he's able to justify why he's working to himself and not hate himself for doing it, which is how do you feel when you feel dominated? it does legitimately uh reduce alienation to get that higher percentage of profit that you get to demand socially as part of a union. we're going to replace that money with money that you are going to borrow from basically your bosses, which means you have to pay it back, which means it's never really your money, so instead of saving for a retirement. when the interest that you've made on all those money that you made and then was able to wisely save and buy a house with thanks to huge government subsidized uh uh suburbanization all of it bought with labor like the sweat on my brow bought this catalac now it's a fucking bank in delaware bought this catatal. and they're letting me use it, introduces a a a new level of hopelessness and and emiseration and conscious alienation, felt sense of compulsion within their relationship to their jobs, so this is just putting a neutron bomb in the heart of like the the social and spiritual health of the working class, this is like a psychic psychic, this is a siop as much as anything else, um, and now it's terminal decline and all the political structures that it needs to sustain itself are coming into critical conflict even though they don't really need to. we could accommodate this transition much more smoothly, but we can't, because we only have political institutions to carry out that will that's counter to profit, and they're fucking sclerotic, they're gone. which is why. saying everything is going to have to come from the fucking like burned over uh wasteland, it's going to come like from the purging of fire, like i know that's apocalyptic, but that forgets to that forgets the fact that the apocalypse is always happening, so imagining an apocalypse in the future is not some uh fantasy. rendition of like an imagined world, it is just a universalization of particular conditions of the present, so if we think of it that way. "if we think of the apocalypse already having happened, right? well, there are people who live there, it sucks, but they're there, there's stuff, there's the refuse, there's the infrastructure that we built, and that means life is going to find a way, as Ian mal said, and we're all going to be part of it, one way or the other." and acting from the heart is the only guide we can have, buse everything else just leads you to apocalypse, like when we talk about politics it ends in apocalypse and that means well and i have to act like that's this day, and if you really ask yourself what does that mean? this is my last day, does it mean you go suicide bombs some fucking uh conservative? i don't think so, i think most of us would want to be around the people we fucking love. I think, I think that would be most people's number one choice, and so I do think that like the the the brain virus of of capitalism, which has like decapitated us and and fully sky uh, fully skynetted us, it's also dependent on a system that is destroying. itself and the people are going to persist beyond the destruction of those systems. the thing is it's not going to all happen at once, it's going to be a process of a combined and uneven apocalypse as it is now, and if there's no recovery from an apocalypse, okay? if they're saying, well no, four degrees, it doesn't matter, everything's gone, well okay, then so what, are you going to act like kefer sutherland in fucking melancholia? or are you going to hang around, and if you hang around, what are you going to do with your time? that's all that you can do with these questions, these things that haunt us and I know they hant me, it's just to remember that, and I still say that as long as there is life of any kind, there is consciousness, a consciousness that we are. eternally connected to, you can call it God, whatever, but I think you have to believe that in some way to justify doing anything other than hurting other people for your own narrow pleasure. I honestly don't know how you can justify in the current conditions and altruistic politics, why wouldn't every other? tell you get off on hurting other people, like the end of like solo, like that is what Possolini is talking about in that movie, that is the end stage of capitalism in final paroxisms of violence, or of collapse, at the very end of collapse, all you have are dominators and dominated, and all you have is this uh displaced horror at the one's impending anniholation that a... sovereign consciousness that does not admit any connection to anything else cannot uh reconcile, it just can't, so you have to smash into the wall, and the way to do that is to seek a life of domination, to pleasure, to create a politics of domination and pleasure, and that is the appeal of fascism, and that's why so much of the left, uh like militant response to the right is ineffective is because it's carried out by people who just want to fight other people. I'm not saying everyone, but I'm saying a chunk. And that has an effect. But that's not to blame anybody for what they do. They're doing what they think is best. What you have to do, you, not they, have to do is ask yourself, what, what am I adhering to? Because if you want to destroy. make somebody pay, even given the idea that it is all gonna, it's all over and there's no turning back from annihilation, if you still think someone has to pay, that's the only thing you can care about, and you're going to peel pleasure at other's expense, first physical, like look at my life, look what i have compared to what other people don't, look at the pleasures I get to feel versus the miseries they get to feel, eventually that of course goes away, is that pesky thin slice of profit starts to burn out of the... equation, the ability to ad and hold on to a surplus and sit on it and and enjoy a life of lezure, not have to productively work, not fake work, productively work, that's known, that's not given up willingly, and then even at the end where, at every point, the rational, logical, long-term best interest to do would be to steer out. of this, we're not, we're steering into it, that's because capitalism is not a rational system, it is, it is rational on its own satanic terms and that it adheres to what extracts, surplus, what derives profit from transaction, and that is domination of one over another. and that is, once you have that social relationship intact, it is its own god, it is its own rational structure, but it is only incidentally connected to humanity, we are all trying to you know grasp towards some best time, what time to do, what time to spend on earth, what do we hear to, what do we care about, we're all just trying to do that. like that's what we're born into, and then we were presented with political relations that guide us towards a uh relationship with each other that makes it impossible to imagine anything other than domination. the long-term best interest would have been a uh a glide path down from the consumption mania of the 80s that led to that... went to the 70s a coordinated uh reversal of of capital flows from the center to the periphery basically and doing that new deal for the world like an actual new deal for the world that the Brenton Woods people thought they were building and in the conditions, the political and economic conditions of the late 40s they were, but then the contest started, you know, the the the the clock of history kicked in and It was only a matter of time, and yeah, like natural law, human nature, all that stuff, the Lockian tradition is a religion, it's a f, it's a it's a, it's essentially the the last... It says that the relationship of a person to a piece of property is essentially magical. All rationality within capitalism dissolves at that initial moment of extraction. It says that by dominating. one has proprietary relationship to, now that is not an inherent human belief, that is not something that we are born with, we are capable of operating outside of that paradigm, one where the notion of ownership is not socially reproducible or conceivable, those that's what David Graber writes about in his book, but those guys all got fucking steam rolled by the people who had built a machine. powered by this reversed satanic logic that would benefit the people at the top at the expense of those at the bottom. it literally is a pact with satan and it is the dark like black mass of capitalism is in that is in that uh transition. that and that's why it's not about like uh people need religion. it's that you can't escape religion. belief is embedded. the ratious worldview is just a is a pagan adherence to uh to domination as uh as domination as signal of uh virtue, of worth, of dessert. this is this is a this is a... and that's why you have the schizophrenia of like the wars of religion of the early modern period, these people fighting over protestantism or catholicism, all of them trying to live, trying to hold on to one system of values uh in the face of another that is just tearing at the roots, because you go first from you know there is no uh property relationship that can that can transcend every social uh value because that's what it's about it says there's no social thing that can transcend property right like if the global economy does collapse and there the econ and capitalism is destroyed at no point uh would that anyone who like really? here's the capitalism, call that a failure of capitalism, it is the god, it cannot fail, it can only be failed, everything that's happening has to happen and should be happening according to capitalism, and there's bumps along the way and there's criers, but the thing is happening, the thing that's happening is prophets are being accumulated, because everything else, all their assumptions about what human virtue is, human value is, what the good life is, what effective altruism is, boils down to wealth, to proper. and the distribution of it, which is based on this global system of extraction, can't be disimbed from it. okay, getting back to this dang book, i'm very sorry, i keep uh, i haven't even got to it yet, so this is the moment here when the thing comes into dominance of the planet, and it's a crisis that in the us leads to, so this is chapter seven, renewing imperial capacity, so you have a crisis in the in the American economy, the unpegging of the dollar, uh, the neoliberal turn, and one of the things that's pushing that is that this crisis creates a unified business political front that brings together all the disparate strains of American capitalism, that are often at battle at the political level, are often like the legislative level, policy level. are often in conflict with one another because they have different short-term interests uh, but like this crisis, necessity all pushes them in the same direction so they can effectively address the moment, meanwhile, the labor movement is totally uncoordinated and cannot uh deal with the crisis because their people are trying to you know strike for better working conditions, they're struggling in their lives, and they're trying to make their lives like less miserable, these people are sitting in fucking uh country clubs. and basting like hams and saunas and eating $10,000 uh endangered uh ostrich eggs, and they get to sit around with their giant vats of money and talk, they don't need to go and uh sit one among many at a fucking local labor uh uh meeting like and have to sit through the roll call and all this shit and like what so that you can you know uh Maybe have a strike and who knows what happens as opposed to get to sit down with politicians and and tell them what you want, so they're able to effectively address the shared interest in making this re uh shift, not towards that soft landing I was talking about that would have replaced consumption with greater, not not necessarily uh wages, but greater worker control. of production and that would have dismantled the consumer is imperative that made exploitation have to be exponentially increased within the system in order to maintain profit. if you get rid of that, you can produce for consumption, especially since we have the computing capacity to administer technological state sufficient to allow us to uh, leave a lot of things to machinery that we have programmed, that we have reprogrammed, the T800, the fucking ter, Arnold from T2, so there's a unified front that pushes for legislation, that pushes uh to do things like insist that when the New York City needs a bailout, because New York is now like one of these European uh countries that's seen their balance sheet go in the wrong direction because of inflation. uh, because there's nowhere for this alienation to go, it's being dissipated, these organized business class is able to insist. on a bailout that leads to one of the first American structural adjustments, first structural adjustment anyway where uh New York was going to have to cut salaries of public employees and pension contributions and and benefit significantly uh and and cut hiring and like you know reduce the quality of life of the city uh and that set the tone for what was going to come, the last gasp of like the the electoral left, the democratic party and the the labor unions behind it like the afl cio, the last gas of their... and government and the kensianism that was the their uh like base political understanding, the basis of their ideology was uh this bill that was uh passed around uh and and argued over in carter's term the humffrey hawkins full employment act because this was because we say like inflation is this uh push and pull uh or uh that monetary policy government fiducia uh like money policy comes down to uh the do you favor keeping inflation low or do you favor um keeping unemployment low? you can't have both, that's the whole premise of of the monetarist notion, and so uh, the the the the the idea that uh, you could actually, you should actually deal with this by uh, just giving everybody jobs, which again means giving people. democratically more control over production, more control over work, because this is not work that is being compelled by the profit motive, it's politically generated, means it is the will of like on the organized section of the American, broad working and middle class, so they got this bill together, got good old, one of the most tragic figures in American history, he's like one of the one of the uh, one of the firebrand progressives of the party uh, in the early or during world war during the new deal era, he had been mayor of Minneapolis, uh, he uh, saw the creation of a civil rights plank for the 48 uh democratic uh platform that led to the walk out of the dixycrats. uh, and then he becomes, he runs against Kennedy, but he can't beat that smile, then he becomes Johnson's vp cuuse he can just lead him around by the pecker, and then he's forced to publicly support a war in Vietnam that he doesn't believe in, gets just narrowly defeated by uh Nixon who was secretly sabotaging the negotiations in Vietnam to extend the conflict, which if there had been a peace treaty signed before November. Huber Humpfrey would have won in a landslide, or at least considering how close it was, I think a very good chance of winning comfortably and certainly narrowly, I don't want to get too specific, whatever, but that was a intervention that cost the lives of millions of vietnameses and Cambodians and the tens of thousands of Americans, and he just had to take it, Johnson knew about it from wiretaps, but they couldn't make it public because that would admit that. the had wire taps and it would make, it would undermine the credibility of the institutions. so humffree, uh, Carter does not really support Humfrey Hawkins, it's really just this uh, it's a baby of these, you know, uh, these old guard liberals like Humpfree and Teddy Kennedy, and it gets passed, but in such a water-down form that it has no enforcement capacity, so there is no gover. during this time of crisis there's no government commitment to full employment, instead we get the volker shock, instead of that, and it is an either or, instead of full employment, we get the volker shock, the huge jumping interest rates that leads to a massive recession uh, but that also breaks the inflationary cycle, the spiral, you see double digit unemployment by 1982, and like Regan was very unpopular at that point. there was a lot of buyers rems around him and they got the the republicans got killed in the mid-terms, but thanks to that fucking real business cycle uh, after a bottoming out the fundamentals uh reinserted themselves and you know you got some defense spending, you got this new credit credit economy, the wages aren't going up anymore, but hey, you know, there's still, there is still a consumer lifestyle that's accessible, uh, but it's at the cost. of any coordinated working class political power, and so wages is not going to go up anymore, so what's? going to fill the gap now is going to be emptied by you know manufacturing by uh by the consumer power of like this middle class uh american uh this middle this bourgeois aspiring american working class uh and the answer is uh financial derivatives they're going to chop up every transaction turn it into another transaction they're going to use a temporal fix there's two fixes that happened in the 70s uh one is a spatial fix where manufacturing is taken into the periphery and like capitalism is developed peripherally uh at the expense of you know industrial capital which is too expensive thanks to the labor demands of an organized working class with political uh influence it's got to go elsewhere to be continue to be profitable and so that is a special fix moving capital from one place to another and then there's the temporal fix of turning this trade network into a synthetic world uh of sales on hypothetical future iterations of this object turning turning uh things into theoretical synthetic capital it's a it's a simulated virtual economy uh and it is at the total control of the high-level uh monetary decision makers in institutions like uh the federal reserve and the IMF, there's no democratic accountability for this economy because it's all controlled by things like interest rate that are not politically determined, so we get instead is uh cheap money everywhere, uh new places to invest, new hypothetical fortunes to be made uh and new uh ways for foreign capital to come back to the United States. Oh boy, I might have to make this one a two partter, I've really, I really uh went too far a field here, uh, I have hm, we'll see how far I can get, um, so you get derivatives markets through deregulating industry, like a lot of the reasons you didn't have these is because there were limits on things like interest rates that banks could give on the deposits that limited how much money you could make in these hypothetical economies uh and they got rid of those and so it exploded but also with it exploded uh regulations in the form of uh guarantees of bailout of uh of... a new structure of two big to fail institutions that have an implicit understood relationship with like uh the central banks to provide liquidity in the in case of crisis uh so that is state intervention in the economy big time this is cardinal sin according to neoliberal economics and yet it is the basis for everything else and in this context the working class is just dissolved like fucking a tooth and starts making concessions and backing down from their commitment to you know continually rising wages they assess they assent to a lot of outsourcing and uh and deindustrialization the moving of a factories from the unionized rust belt to the uh union-free uh southern southeast and then later southwest uh and so the wage line flattens that is totally understandable because you're in crisis that all i can do to stay ahead of the... ball here uh is vote to get lower taxes cuuse I know I'll get them the democrats will promise me x y z but the republicans lower taxes so that means I get I get more money and it's like I've totally normalized the fact that I'm being more exploited and the thing is what else are they supposed to do there is no more institution that can embody their greater aspirations they've been dissolved. and you and the national labor relations board and the department of labor get staffed with pro uh pro business people at former capitalist themselves were just there in government for a few years to ride herd on uh the these uh these cocky unions and and union uh the capacity to organize is dismantled and one of the big set pieces of that is of course the katco strike when the uh air traffic controllers who endorsed Regan in 1980 because Carter had been such an enemy of and labor so hostile that they thought they might get uh to a better deal with Reagan not realizing how far they were gonna go because boom they got fucking wiped out they got uh fired in mass and it just put a shock through the entire labor uh movement, put him on the backfeet uh, so the economy is now just a series of bubbles from now on and then they start popping through the 80s, the first one to pop is the savings and loan uh industry, savings and loans were known hilariously as thrifts were these new deal era organizations like fucking Jimmy Stewart in uh uh it's a wonderful life uh they were supposed to allow for community level uh retail. banking that would give high interest rates uh to savers that would then allow for the extension of mortgages to uh people who were in the uh within the savings and loan uh membership this business model is just getting annihilated by um by deregulation it cannot handle it and it should have been fucking utthanized but instead it was allowed to metastasize into this just ridiculous bubble uh that uh went way that made them inflate way beyond any ability to uh substantiate the speculation and so it popped a lot of it were slush funds for fucking contras and pedophiles uh that that is sort of a thing they don't talk about here that i would really like to read a book specifically about uh it's about uh the way that savings and loans were used by like local political uh uh uh power structures uh to like distribute um patronage and launder money uh i'd like to know more about that, they don't really talk about it uh because there was so much fraugunt underwriting they were just making up numbers and so of course you can make that money go anywhere of course it will uh and you can't sustain it it pops and then they're out the government has to pay back all this money uh it's always an injection of liquidity says the day uh, the thing that saves the market after sesanels is mortgage back securities, this is a thing that is a solid gold investment and it becomes a huge source of foreign capital flowing into the United States. uh, people are buying up mortgage back securities, it it prop back up that uh, industry, because remember that had been one way of funding people's homes, get a get a nice stable interest rate mortgage from a family from a neighborhood uh thrift. where your money is in Steve's house and it's in Bill's house, that's gone, instead we have a deal where, you can get a mortgage from whoever will offer you the most enticing interest rate in the moment, you can get it at a consumer level, and that allows for much bigger uh security, it allows you to to uh, it allows you to trade the shit and speculate. but this leads to uh among other things a huge collapse of uh independent banks like huge consolidation around big regional power powerful banks which of course is totally inevitable in a situation like this 36% of all independent banks in the United States closed between 1979 and 1994 I thought that was a wild statistic um so uh this new emphasis on derivatives and things like bonds security. and uh leads to uh an opportunity to make a lot of money trading the shit and doing the actual facilitating of the trades and that's where uh firms like golden stacks become like the huge powers that they end up being is in trading these bonds and trading these securities uh and a lot of this is money flowing into the US to buy treasury bonds because with the vulker shock those interest rates are so attractive that foreign money from Japan from Europe just flooded the United States uh in the 80s and that money had to be managed uh and one thing that these uh instruments did is that they blended different types of capital, different rates of uh interests, different uh currency exchange rates and it allowed them to uh to synthesize those things to work out those uh those incongruities uh within uh like one synthetic um commodity like you can buy it and you have within it guaranteed the translation basically across interest rates and time frames and and exchange rates um and this new these new instruments then become uh the thing that creates a like a real global financial structure because now you have something that like you know is like the petro dollar in that it's circulation guarantees all the other uh transactions and so it'll facilitates this the realization of this global capital uh and one of the things ironically that fuels this money that's coming in to invest here is not from foreign countries it's from pensions because you still have a lot of people who had gotten pensions uh as part of their union contracts that they still had and that money had to be invested somewhere while they waited for to put it out in checks and so this no huge huge flow towards uh the the derivatives market and makes pensions and the uh dependent on the success of these institutions, so because of all this money flashing around and all these new instruments, glass steegel, even though they repealed it in 99 or whatever uh is already a dead letter in reality by this point, it just could not uh keep up with the speed of things uh and in of course and we can't forget talking about the vulker shock how uh the rise of interest rates leads to the overall overnight almost default of almost all of Latin America who could who were uh depending on the ability to to continue to service uh one level of interest and then we're totally incapable it's like when the apr is changed in 2009 it's like we can't pay this and the US uh bailed them out with structural adjustments but the money did not go to the uh countries the countries had to make do with their domestic products. It was not an investment into anything, it went to the banks that had underwritten the debt, because the fantasy of risk under the justifying capitalism, is that there is any chance to this stuff, that these people aren't being held in the everlasting arms of of the state, which they claim to be different from at every level, it's a pantamine, so that's more money flowing into the system, that's more. just a strect direct uh state influx of cash uh into this uh financialized economy, all that of course leads to another more general bubble, thing gets too fast, gets ahead of it skies, and then you have bloody Monday in 1987, and how and it's a huge crash, bigger percentage fall than on uh than on uh what was it black monday black friday, the the one in the 29 uh more a larger percentage. drop but instantly uh met with liquidity, which of course the institutions to do that didn't exist in 1929. now though, you have a bump like that, boom, instant liquidity, so the fucking stock market gets back up and is zooming until the early otts it's this unprecedented boom time, and during this period, the US uses a threat of protectionism because you know, even though you have this huge uh stock market boom, you have with and unemployment up in manufacturing sectors, people are losing their jobs, their good uh union jobs and are having to live more precariously, and it's causing a real politics of protectionism, and they mostly just at government level use it cynically to force free trade regimes on foreign countries, we we used it as a as as the as the pry uh against Mexico and Canada to be like, look, we don't want to do tariffs and fuck you people out of being able to export to us, but our domestic politics is making us, so you have to give us a deal on this shit so we can provide them with cheap imports to make up for the fact uh that their wages aren't going down or that they make less money than they used to uh so you have a big boom and as i said profit's up uh but wages flat all of this because of uh increased technology and uh increased productivity brought about by technology. which used to be distributed uh more broadly across the the labor divide, but is now holy horded, profit is holy horded, so uh, so it's stagnant, so you have a stagnant ring class at the end of this, and then there's four key shifts in the US uh economy during this period, that put it on a completely different footing by the turn of the millennium, one is the shift for... manufacturing to finance that we talked about, manufacturing went down, I mean we still manufactured, and there was manufacturing, there was manufacturing investment in the 80's too, mostly from Japan, but uh, but moving from high-wage union states to low-wage non-union states mostly uh, but the the percentage of the economy, the the percentage of corporate profits that went to uh finance went from 17%, roughly year to year from 1960 to 1984 to 30% from 1984 to 2007 uh, so you get this financialization of the economy and therefore the uh the rise of shareholder value as a framework for understanding regulations uh fucking morality itself, shareholder value is the closest thing there is to a moral heart to capitalism, and it is just the prophet motive enshrined as a religion, the religion of he has it, therefore he deserves it, um, that becomes the dominant ethos of capitalism, which makes it much more short term, which leads to accelerating. cycles of bust, accelerating crisis within the institutions which we're not living through, uh, but they can't be stopped because there is no working class resisting it. uh, number two, uh, you see that that what what I was talking about earlier, the shift in manufacturing internally from high-wage uh midwest to the low-wage south and south southwest, and the introduction of like mean, lean production techniques, the kind that were pioneer. in Japan where the working class is much weaker and therefore much more of uh the sort of efficiencies the capitalism tried to impose to shore up profits in the early 70s that were resisted in Europe and the United States by the organized working class being like I'm not doing that in Japan they said okay I'll do that because they did not have sufficient uh organizational capacity to resist it and since organizational capacity is exactly what the US left had lost or the US working class had lost. uh, they were able to impose it, the lean systems of production, which increased uh exploitation, then you have the boom, and this is the thing that really made sure that the United States was always going to maintain its, it's hegemoneny as as the world currency, is that even though you've got advanced capitalist economies developing in Japan and in Europe, the United States dominates the high tech production sector, not just comp but pharmaceuticals, bio uh, biotech, all that stuff, the United States was absolutely dominated the entire world at that, and as such uh, had a advantage over everyone else in uh gathering capital, keeping capital on uh flowing within the American uh sphere, not not, not losing that precious buying power, and then fourth, the rise of professional service. this is the david this is these are the david graver bullshit jobs consultants uh administrators uh the people the jobs that you're offering uh the broad middle and working class their kids i should say buse you've offered a house to the the one generation now the next generation coming up you're not going to get a house maybe uh or you you'll be able to get a house but you're going to pay a lot more and it's going to take you longer blah blah blah you know it's going to get worse over time uh uh, but you can still aspire to it, you can still aspire to a middle class and that, but now instead of that being something that anybody who went to high school could do, anybody who learned a stand in a line could do, because that was accessible to uh, working class people, people with un, no advanced degrees who are using their bodies exploiting their labor power uh, in order to generate surplus, now that path is closed, those jobs are gone and going away, but these new jobs are there, but you have to go through the hoops, you have to go through additional social hoops, you have to provide more levels of financialization and profit, you have to turn this transaction into a trans of transaction. that they can be chopped up, purchased and and swapped. I know MMT describes how state currencies created work for, it doesn't matter. You're like the Georges, you think that because it's right, it means it'll win. It's an interesting factoid, but it is not the fucking archimedian lever to move the world. That is, I'm sorry, nerd shit to think so. so you have this new creation of a new class, you want to call it the professional managerial class, whatever, it is a new... i wouldn't say it is a new uh is it a new class that's interesting uh you honestly might call it a new class in that it is something that is post class it's it's a it is a post class that you can't talk once once the heart of the working class the labor movement is pulled out once that like and drive train of the left broadly understood is removed you can't really talk about uh All right, so you don't have classes anymore, because what is organizing people along a class access? nothing, consumer access, racial access, gender access, uh, demographic access, demographic. representative, consumer, yes, they have jobs, people have jobs, they are extractive to one degree, if you're paid by, if you're paid by another to do it, you are alienated, there is no, getting rid of that, you do not control the conditions of your work, therefore you are not, you are at one level or another of proletarianization, as opposed to the capitalist on the other side of that transition. they are and their whole political agenda is staying there, that's why there could be no national socialism, because the imperative to stay at the top will dissolve all of the uh flimsy moral architecture that gets along people who are in it for confused but real human uh interest as opposed to just being a monstrous demon mouth. oh no, i i violated orthodoxy about the vulker raider something, i don't know, the vulker rate hike actually isn't that important to a lot of this stuff, it really was the uh creation of these uh liquidity uh these structures, these things that instantly pump liquidity into capitalism at moments of crisis, which is a state intervention, but also then like the removal of regulated. on speculation, that's what really did it, uh, that was just one structure that helped drive it in a direction, because again, I don't care what really caused inflation, it was a totem of discipline to labor, everything revolved around it, and that's what it accomplished, and one of the things that accomplished is by financial. the lives of workers, they they facilitated intensification of their social alienation, so because I said, instead of people buying things with money they earned, they started buying it with money they had borrowed, and that that is a soul eader, and it certainly eats away your ability to imagine being politically, uh effective, like to have a political voice, so when we're that when we're talking about the response to this, this is what we're talking about, who cares what they actually did, nerd shit, i'm sorry, i'm talking at the level that where things actually move, and that's why we can't speak of classes anymore, because the existence. sufficient to build class consciousness no longer exists, so it doesn't make sense to talk about classes other than as academic categories, the problem is if we only address academic subjects, we can only we'll only ever use academic categories, because what other categories are uh are relevant, and so we can only have academic answers, trying to argue who is the working? class is a literal waste of time, it could be fun, but it's a waste of fucking time, cuz you're talking about like who uh, barry bonns better than babe rooth, we live in a reality of post class, we have to reckon with what that means, all right, i got to, i got to cut it off here guys, i will, i only did one chapter, but uh, i think maybe like Early next week I'll drop in and do the second one uh and then do the next two on Friday still. Bye-bye.
