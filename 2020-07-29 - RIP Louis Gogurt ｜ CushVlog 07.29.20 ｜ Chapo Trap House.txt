 Hey, there we go, says we're streaming in the right area, so hopefully we're going here, we have exited host mode, better post this. There it is, hey, hey, sorry, I'm a little early, but my schedule is such that uh, I wanted to get one in today since I didn't do yesterday, and this was the chime I had, so hopefully if you, you're waiting for six, you can watch this puppy tomorrow for the next day on the you, the you'. youtube or on twitch if you'd like, you can still see the questions if you watched on twitch, uh, so another, so Louis gomar having covid is very funny, Louis Goomart going to his staff in person to tell them that he had it in a. building is even funnier, but he'll be fine, he'll be fine, he's not going to give it to anybody, like there's a picture of him or there's a video of him coming out of a very small unventilated room with bob bar, he's not going to get it, and if he does he'll be fine, he will be fine, they'll all be fine, the more evil you do the more you are uh protected from covid, it's like the the disease itself is acting out the will of of all the most demonic. demirgical forces and culture, because even as this uh thing has you know thrown a huge monkey wrench into the social fabric and might very well have doomed the Trump administration to electoral defeat, it is only strengthen the power of our dracula like rulers. Yeah, like if the more evil you do the more antibodies you form against coronavirus, but we can't tell people that because then they're all going to go to law school. boom, zing. That was a good 90's joke. People hated lawyers in the 90s, and you can make an argument that the whole anti-law thing in the 90s Linal Huts on. was part of the propaganda operation against torts that was going on, because by that point corporations had won most of the big battles about the regulation uh, but that left the courts as the way to for consumers to get recompence for recklessness and uh dangerous behavior by corporations was but to sue them uh and so lo and behold we spent in a decade talk about how awful lawyers are all the time, because some woman pours hot coffee on herself at Sus McDonald's. I mean, I'm sure everybody knows at this point that that whole thing was a scam and that the top coffee that the famous coffee lady uh got from McDonald's was scolding hot to the point that she had significant burns and required skin grafts, which meant that they were incredibly negligent to hand that to her in a fucking drive-through and her lawsuit was completely and justified, but has anybody has anybody heard of any like knowingly actively evil people who died of covid, apparently some guys on death row died of covid, but like those aren't the ones you want, because they've already been punished, you know, like if they're evil, first of all, they're evil even if they've killed people is very much smaller than the evil that is being perpetrated by people at the top of our cannibalistic hierarchy, and they are already in prison. I saw the deadspin thing uh, I think the prescript, the subscription model, I mean as long as there's going to be media on the internet, it looks like the subscription model is going to be what wins it out, uh, the the reason that a lot of people dismissed that for years and said, no, no, who's going to who's going to pay for stuff that's free, uh, the question, the answer to that is, they will pay if they feel that they have some sort of... or connection with the project, like it, there has to be something social that transcends a pure transaction to have that happen, because it is just a pure transaction, if the media is as alienated from us as like movie studios are, we're going to pirate, we're going to go around paywalls always, the thing that's going to stop us from doing that is if we have an investment, if we feel like we're literally having an investment in the thing, and i think our show is part of that, i think dead spin, the new deadspin thing is going to be part of that, and uh, it boils down to sadly to say clout in a way, uh, it's down to the ability to have a online profile that has buying from people, and it's going to have to fill, it's going to fill the void of traditional media, which is completely collapsing, because there's no money in it, but they're all for profit companies and that doesn't really work. but yeah, i and they're all going to go away because as long as it's just some you know conglomerate, some faceless entity, no one is going to want to pay for it if they can get it for free, people will pay for something they could hypothetically get for free if they feel like they're contributing to something, and that's going to that's going to fill the gap, and you could argue that that's a good sign because it indicates the that people. are finding the limits of a totally marketized media space, they're seeing, oh shit, when there's no public interest in media, it actually is terrible, it sucks and all the good stuff is removed cuuse buse, the market stuff was always about efficiency of transmission and and you know things like that, it was never about the uh the quality if any it only inhibited the quality. someone says the conglomerates should stop paying for punditry and pay for journalism, there's two reasons they won't, one, journalism is much, much more expensive than pundetry, and the margins in media won't allow for that, even if they wanted to, but I think what one of the one of the realities of post-70s uh crisis capitalism is that a lot of these choices are made, not uh out of an a lot of these choices to streamline and and uh you know pivot all this It's not just to fuck with people and it's not just to suppress good work, it's to save those razer thin profit margins, and that's true of a lot of industies, so they're not going to pay for reporting, I mean obviously there's the you know like there's the hey man, they're going to f, they don't want to find out stuff that they don't want to, they don't want us to know this stuff, they're not going to pay to find it out, and there's truth to that, but also it's just too fucking expensive. It's going to have to be ad, like the future of journalism, like actual investigative journalism is going to be advocacy based around the crowdfunding model, like hey, why isn't anybody reporting on x, y or z? someone should, and then money's people are going to people who want to see that reported on are going to spend money to see it reported on, and that's and that's what it's going to be, and and I think people have been advocating that for a long time and a lot of uh, a lot of early adopters to that model. failed because we hadn't reached the point we're at now of total and complete alienation from the absolute garbage hose of online media like now we realize that there that oh you you cannot get media for free and expect it to have inequality in a in a capitalist system uh somebody's asking about the next unemployment say i mean we have the bids right the democrats the republicans bid two and the democrats said whatever, we're not married to six, so that implies that they'll just end up at two, but I don't know, things are really bad and I think a few people in Washington seem to get at least some level of how bad things are, like manuchen, which might go against the ideological sort of head in the ass uh detachedness of the rest of these idiots, so we'll see, I say though, i don't want to get smug about it, but just uh, when people were saying elthing's going to run out at the end of of July and everything and then ever, i've no way. they're going to let it on up July, they're going to wait until the last minute so that it doesn't look like uh it's so that you don't get used to it so that it's always emergency funding and so that they can have an excuse to pair it down in negotiations but uh no it was always going to happen come on uh this is an interesting question this is an interesting point out that if if didspin 2.0 is enough it's going to get bought by a vc thing. well, see that's where that's where like the question of trust comes in, you know, like the the subscriptions are pouring in for this because people know these writers and they think they know what their values are, and they that they think that that militates against them selling out. uh, and there the question is like not just their beliefs, but also their ability to thrive. 'if they're successful enough, I don't know if there would be pressure for them to have to sell out, especially, I don't know, I think overhead comes up to a lot of it, because I think reading the stories of digital media companies that have gone under, uh, the question of overhead seems like a huge one, is all these places in order to maintain, in order to impress their vc uh donor, their VC with fucking sushi and all that and then like even if you get rid of the perks you still have the real you still have the this the fixed overhead of the the infrastructure and that's like that's what if there's a potential for for something like the deadspin relaunch to be viable it's if they realize the the the the lack of necess for that, we're not trying to impress vcs, so we don't have to have a fucking office, if they buy an office, that'l be very annoying, i will say that, don't buy offices for the love of god, at least not ones that aren't like anything more than uh, than a fraction of a fraction of of of the amount of money you can, but sure shit cannot be any kind of like big big expense, thing in terms of consolidation, the podcast thing is going to be interesting because it looks like uh fucking spotify is making a play to try to own the podcasting genre, they got everything, they got rogan, they got last podcast on the left, um, i bet that when the yukilali playing dumb ass who owns patreon fucks it up, they're probably going to buy his uh, his uh database and his you know uh subscription. but then spotify will get bought by somebody, it'll all end up being owned by Disney, serious stitcher and so stitcher is the other one, at some point stitcher and uh, at some point stitcher and spotify are going to be it, and then one of them is gonna, they're all going to get bought by disney, spoiler, i i i don't obviously left. on the left isn't equal to Rogan, I was just shocked to see it go to uh spotify, buse like Rogan is essentially a commercial radio show in a lot of ways, he sits there and he talks for four hours, it's like Imus, he has sponsors, you know, and he reads this up, it just feels like Imus, whereas last podcast like that was a patreon model for a while, I mean eventually they got ads and stuff, but it just feels more uh indie and the fact that it got bought out like that, that's what really made me feel like damn spotify is making a move. but yeah we're uh it's all going to get consolidated unless people can like create durable low overhead models for for for subscription and the problem with that is you have to get buying like i'm saying first because you can't buse if nobody knows you are to begin with they're not gonna they're not going to risk giving you money. you have to have a like a built-in audience and that's where clout comes in, it really does come down to the clot war and the clout chase, the clout grind, because if you're not on there getting clout no one's going to fucking risk, no one's going to know enough about you to first of all even know that you're you're doing your own thing or certainly to give you fucking money to do so, so more incentivate more. responsible for this, this model existing as anybody, but the thing i console myself. and is just knowing that this is not the this is not the doing of any discrete section of people of society, this is this is part and parcel of the intensification of uh exploitation, not necessarily intensity of like labor, but but uh exploitation and alienation of the self, like if there's no without the imperial core. or without the industrial core, with a insufficient economic base uh, in service industry and stuff to to facilitate like productive work for large portions of the population uh, the option is to auto exploit your your personality, to make living your job in some way by by. by attracting people to your orbit, tik tok, podcasts, uh, twitter, whatever, you know what I'm talking about, and it's uh, because it's an alternative to a a a wildly bleek uh economic uh system outside of of those those social entrepreneur opportunities. Oh boy, the hank pill, man, I won't say her name, but the person who compared the grill pill to the hank pill today on twitter was very funny to me, uh, for those that don't know, uh, honk pill is some painful forchan nerd bullshit uh, about like it's like ironic naziism that's not ironic, whatever, it's all the kind of really cool stuff that, I don't, when when you start talking about the... bonk pill and then your next words are this is extremely dangerous. that really is to me a sign you need to fucking log the fuck off. it's the hank pill and i know i know i know fascism is often uh intentionally clownish and and uh and theatrical and bufoonish and that that's part of what cloaks it, but in this case you're talking about a actual handful of people, all of whom. have spent their entire adult lives to the extent that they're adults and most of them are kids on the internet and it's not even like they're the scary hacker guys going on like the dark web to assassinate their fucking middle school principal it's they're just posting cringe all day every day but anyway these are like ironic nazis or something and and this person says that uh the reason that they're the same is that they both say uh LOL matters and the thing that that indicates to me more than anyone anything is just how how built in to people to the point where they don't even I don't even think they realize it in their minds the connection between politics and posting it like the number it's amazing like it's been very clear the the explicit argument has always been law off and do something real, because you will get captured by a false anti-dialectical uh, okay, it's you're walking into play-doh's cave, on purpose, don't do that, but what people here is stop log off means stop posting, that means stop sharing content, that means stop arguing with people, and that means stop. because caring is posting, and i understand, i really understand why people think that because there's so few avenues for most people to effectively act, but that's why you got to log off because then you have to find one, you have to, and yeah, some of these guys, by the way, some of these hon dudes. going to do school shooting or like a uh they're going to kill people probably, but i mean it's weird, i think they there was a common understanding among like educated people for a while that yes, discrete political, but also uh pop culture objects can be triggers for people to commit violence, but that it's never the thing itself that leads to the violence. i think we had that like kind of assumed for a long. but then because everyone started huddling in the cave, they stopped thinking that way, and i can have understand the reasoning of like, well if everyone's online more and putting more energy into online, then that means that the the acts that they carry out are going to be more uh, they're more likely, they can be more influenced by like violent content and by violent politics to do an act, and the thing is that might be true, but if it is, it's not the discrete memes or politics that's the problem, it is the internetification of life, like at every level, approximate triggers for for violence, for for the proximate triggers for unorganized lonewolf political violence uh is the same as for school shooters uh and and general social misfits uh it's and those though those urges are are generated by by i'm sorry by a fucking material economic base say to sound like a broken record and it's our inability to face that that makes us flee to social fixes, if we can ban x, y or z, then we can remove the the approximate triggers and it's like, yes you can, but you've done nothing to stop the alienation, that's at the heart of it, and then once again it's like, yeah, but what can you do, and it's like, I don't know either, but I know for shit, you can't, I know sure shit you can't do it by engaging at the symbolic level, all I know is it won't be found there, what it is, I don't know. but it won't be found there, that means everyone is required to do something else, and a lot of people, they don't want to, not just they can't think of one, they wouldn't want to do something else if they could, and to them i say tough, but it's not niolism, jesus christ, it's just absurd, nialism isn't even real, there are any nialists, everybody has some sort of fucking uh, motivating like architecture for the world, some... like personal hedenism is not nialism, you believe in your own pleasure. oh boy, uh, i got to say when i saw the uh, when i saw that the Washington post was capitalizing white to acknowledge like the cultural, the unified cultural like. experiences of whiteness and oh boy, chill, got a chill running down the spine, not good stuff, i mean i think it's probably an overstatement to say that that's going to contribute in any real way to uh intensifying racism and white nationalism, but i think that it's it's a trevelling current of response to the black lives matter movement, i would say that, and it's one that white frayalty also echoes, which is and white frayalty says specifically, white people need to be racially aware of themselves as white. and that is what the uh Washington Post wants, they want white people to be aware of themselves as white. Now, how much damage that does when the Washington Post says it to their bunch of fucking coffee table uh, you know, fucking liberal uh, professional class readers all sitting in front of their uh their breakfasts or or clicking on it at their office jobs uh or you know white frayalties to her pod of uh, It probably doesn't matter what any of them think, but in general, as a response to to the acknowledgement of racial discrimination in society, telling white people in a period of unprecedented for the modern era, economic and social dislocation and dissolution, that the... that's a recipe for oh that's the race wall you got going on there you got that race wall going oh yeah no b me oh shit you want that good race ball you want that good race ball well first first you going to put in that that collapsing economy oh you want to put that in there you want everybody to be precarious oh you want everybody terrified they either lost their job they know somebody lost their job or their job no good yeah you want that oh you want something else how about that social network how about that social network falling apart how about how about pandemic disease? how about social dislocation? how about urban, how about some urban conflict? how about total dissolution of faithh in political systems? how about the destruction of a shared reality? how about we do that? and then o that's good, but that's not going to get you that deep good race war, you won't get that deep good race war, you put into some of that white. because the assumption of the fucking Washington Post people and of Robin Diangelo is that everybody's like them, everybody is a good, college educated, eticate accuculturated liberal and that when you tell them, hey, you're white, it's going to make them consider their privilege, you're right, I am white, let me think about what it means to be white, in terms of what a burden it is to be white, of of guilt, of of generational trauma inflicted, and how I have to rectify that, and how I every day am contributing to this, that's what they would do if the... got reminded they were white, so that's what everybody should do. well, not everybody did your little fucking pot to do, nobody no, not everybody went to the crumpet and t- circuit and learned that racism is impolite, not that it's really bad, that's not really what you learn, you learn that it's impolite, and so when they hear as their jobs are fucking going away and as everyone in their neighborhood is dying of fucking either covid or op opium uh addiction, uh, you know what, uh, what does it mean to be a discrete, a unified culture with? in a polyglot uh social institution that is falling the fuck apart, completely collapsing. are we to, what's the new order? as this dissolves, as everyone loses faith that there is a a stable future in something called the United States of America, what will we pick up the pieces with? what heuristics will we use to choose friend from foe as reorganizing in the rubble. here's Robinela on the fucking Washington Post with a nice ready-made. for you race, who can you trust, hubba, hubba hubba, who can you trust? the answer for most people is going to be somebody who have a cultural affinity and uh, and continuity with, which you can't really afford all that multicultural stuff in the context of crisis and collapse. at least that's what people are going to be thinking. that's why right now the the the the the like the social fronment. happening right now, the collapse happening right now could be very good, in fact it could save this planet if it if it's if it happened early enough to to establish like new foundations that can push us away from capitalism and it's destruction of the environment, but man do we not have the left institutions for it right now, that's the horrible thing, that's the thing that's so terrifying, and things like this fill the void, and that's why I fear if there is a if there is like a significant buckling, and and the unif'. infrastructure and unified control and unified order and a monopoly on state violence are compromised that people are going to do anything other than clan up along the most obvious lines, and a lot of what's considered to be on the left when we're talking about race is aiding that. i don't think for a lot of people and on purpose, not everybody's a CIA co-intel pro agent, i think because they they feel guilt, they they they feel personally as a white person officiary of racial uh uh of of racial inequality and perpetuated racial violence and the thing is they are, they do, of course they do, but it's a question, what do you do about it? and the answer for people, especially people who have had the pinky extending lessons in college is to say, i will renounce my privilege and i will, i will, i will basically uh put myself prostrate before. uh uh the people i have wrong and the that instinct is very bound by by i would say social social at the level of social honestly it's a lot of it is college i've said it before people don't go to college not to feel guilty or to get brainwashed they go to college to get a job but one of the things they learn is if you want a bourgeois life you need a bourgeois job and this values are, that's what college has always been for doing, and and so people who have had that experience have are more likely to have that response to the horror, but what they end up doing is they end up unintentionally reifying racial difference as foundational, saying like there's no way to really have like even relationships between the races cuuse of the because of the buried uh trauma and mutual distrust, i mean maybe you could use that to work on something. in a context where everybody has to get along because they're I don't know uh they work at the same company and it's a fucking uh diversity training which is the model for a lot of this stuff or a college classroom but if it's a bunch of people who don't have you have no like persuasive authority over I'm not talking about state authority there's no state authority really there's not really there's only only the echo of state authority at the work on the uh and most workplaces most office work places and in college campuses, what is there in the person of the boss in the person of coworkers, classmates and teachers is social authority that you are invested in, you wouldn't be there if you weren't, you wouldn't. at that job, you wouldn't be at that college if you weren't invested. we're just Americans, we just all dropped in here without any uh, any agreement, and he and we never, and most of us have not been accuculturated through processes whereby we instinctively uh, adhere to a social authority. in fact, the way capitalism is hyperaccelerating, all forms of social authority have been completely destroyed and and turned into discrete like clanish self-affirmation societies. uh built along the the market model uh of the of the subgroup, of the marketed subgroup, and in that context, they there's no, there's no, especially somebody who is suffering, somebody whose life is bad and getting worse, especially somebody who is seeing the infrastructure that maintains social life collapse, it's hard to tell them, no, no, no, you have to feel bad for them. It's like, well, yeah, in a in a theoretical way, but I'm not bought into your, I am not bought into the basic premises that you have, you've not brought me along through the process, and it's impossible to, because there's no self motivation to begin with, like somebody applying to go to the college, somebody applying to go work at the job, even if it's attenuated by hey, I have to go to college to get a good job, I have to go here to work and keep a roof over my head, but like the discrete choice of the illusion of choice within those things gives us a sense that we are picking something, even if you can say we're not, we're picking a specific college, we're picking a specific employer, and and that act of choosing within a small range of choices that have already been made for us, gives us the illusion of autonomy, but it's a real sense of illusion to us and that means that we have bought in at a psychological level to the social pressures and morrays of those areas, there is no similar pressure getting people that you are don't know. to get along with your ideas on race, there's no way to do it, and as social order collapses, the only thing that's going to be left, the residue of all this is going to be the one undeniable fact that because of the racial uh, the way that racist shaped the literal geography of this country, like the fucking Danyan expressway in Chicago, cutting black and white Chicago and half like a fucking katana on the order of uh Richard Daily uh is that social life as a result is wildly segregated and that means social trust is segregated and the only hope we have either challenging the existing system or to fill or to uh successfully filled the gap created by a more generalized crisis and collapse is if we all overcome that the class consciousness. Oh my god, yeah, in the afterscape, can you imagine the clans like queuenon will be the for foundation of a new religion, it will be, and in fact I would argue that if you play this out, like a fall of the Roman empire, post Europe, right, where like you you, they effloressed all these like microstates, uh, there was the period of of uh, conflict between like uh temporal and spiritual authority uh, and then... finally the solidification in e the early modern era of like relatively large uh uh centralized states, centralized monarchies or empires, barring the holy roman of course, if you had that in the United States, like and you had like in the like like there was after the the uh fall of the Roman empire a bunch of different types of real mostly different varieties of christianity, you know, got your arian arianists, gnostics, all those guys, what do they call it? monophysists, if we have a similar thing like in a post cops america que and on i bet would be the one to win out, it would be, it would be the it would be like a and if if if they ended up having a a you know social revival a couple thousand years from now or not ev not even that couple hundred uh christianity would be like had been finally finally fully americanized like like mormanism hyper like hypernormalized mormanism so that's it's like uh yeah no not only did Jesus come to america he fought a war in America against the forces of darkness personified by George Soros and Hillary Clinton ritually ate babies to give them strength. uh in the name of Satan and there was like a a a battle and uh and Jesus was like temporarily routed Jesus and Donald Trump were temporarily routed from the field but they'll return like the... include like Trump will be the included maty in the future q and on uh christianity so you can everyone can have fun with that imagine that that'l be fun that's one of those things it's like god give me a time machine i just want to see it i want to see what in 100 years. um, somebody says uh, yeah, this would be the final Americanization of Christianity, which reminds me about something about mormanism that I wanted to say, we talked about, me and Felix talked about mormanism uh, on the show on Monday, and I wanted to elaborate a little bit, because I've been thinking just about how ingenious the mormons are, uh, because they basically solved protestant, American protest, they've solved the problem of American protestants. and then because they had solved that later, after it fully matured, they were able to solve the problem of American capitalism, and in so doing they have resisted a lot of the worst social decay of of the rest of us, like light dropping life expectancies, fertility rates, uh, drug addiction, all this stuff, uh, and that's why, Felix is always saying like, mormons are who evangelicals think they are, and that's so perfect, that's so perfect. because they both have a a a religion where they have a fused prosperity, material prosperity with spirituality and personified it in the country they live in uh, but the difference is is that mormons maintain a social cohesion that allows capitalism to work for them, whereas the the uh evangelical has been fully dissolved and atomized by the market and is a complete like yeah he's like yes i'm i'm a business man it's like yeah a mormon guy he has like three uh car car uh washers that he owns, he's got a nice family, 16 kids, his every weekend his wife and all the other wives go in the b in the basement, the finished basement and they all sell each other multi-level marketing uh products to keep the economy moving, uh, but yeah, evangelical thinks that sam, but no, he's on his fourth divorce, porn addicted guy with he's like going to like burn down his ski to dealership for the insurance money and it's become says mormons solved both of the big problems, how do you, how do you, how do you be christian in America, how do you, how do you reconcile uh the social, like the social aspect of religion with the depersonalizing experience of living in the material absurdity of America from the point of view of European settlers and their descendants, and and even before that, how and how do you uh reconcile the... inevitable like national fetishization that will occur, which is what we have done, this is what American protestantism is, worshipping America, how do you reconcile that to a religious tradition, protestant christianity that imagines its origins in a completely different place and time, pre-capitalist, pre-eupean, how how can you be an American and worship americanly without religion, and even more. even more deep than that, how do you solve the problem of the ego-centered materialism of the of what American protestantism will have to become to accommodate, the pursuit, the ability to always pursue material act a material gain to offset spiritual loss, the crank, the one way crank that will inevitably lead to the total dessacralization of the public space and the profainement of all, it's a one way raction. um and and the thing that causes that is uh is is a ego-based and ego-fixated social order you you because America is so prosperous it it twists uh it it gets the wires to cross within the mind where material pursuit where ego gratification and ego gratification at a material level because that's what's that's what's to be had is the same as the good, and therefore is God, but that means you're God, right? kinda, you have unless you, you can't be absorbed, right? you can't be absorbed into an eternal thing, and also be the sum total of of of uh the universe, the sum total of the of the moral requirement of the universe to you, is your advancement. how the hell do you handle that? the mormon solve that theological problem by saying, oh, when you go to heaven, you become God. you get your own planet and you get to do sims for eternity, that's how you, that's how you solve that problem. the other problem, of course, you saw by saying, oh yeah, no, Jesus came to america, he ministered to the natives, then they had a big for it's true uh, there's these golden plates, the the uh, the garden of even is in Missouri, you've replaced it, you've reterritorialized, and then by staying together, by staying together, by going to Utah together, being persecuted, really the persecution probably helped, they were able to create a social order where rather than allowing capitalism to define the social space and dissolve them all away into particles. they use capitalism as like a capillary network to circulate money in their economy, like i'm not kidding, multi-level marketing works in in uh Utah, because the reason all those things fail the rest of the places because eventually and in for most cases very quickly you run out of people to sell to, because who the hell does anyone know? how many friends do people have? how many relatives do people have? how many close relatives do people have? preaters out, it's like in a perpetual motion machine in Utah, and not only that, like that's that's the housewives, they even like both it's there's they've they've solved all this stuff, they got two parents working because the husband has the business that ts everybody's roof or whatever and then he gets his you know pool clean by the other guy and it circulates, the circulation of economy as they say and that's always sunny and the wives are giving each other lulu or uh like stretch pants and tupperware parties and so you got both both partners working but the the the the wife's work is one that allows her to also be a domestic partner the way that traditional of of capitalism unbound by by any kind of social cohesion which will be all capitalism in an open social order that does not have like boundaries to it uh will lead to total total atomization and enemy. and so you got all these guys, all these all these evangelicals, whose lives are miserable, who are filled with genuine hate, in a way that would make Jesus's blood curtal, and and and whose religion has been oriented subconsciously around satism, it's because all the shit that they think they believe is is is directly wired to the opposite of that, and they're not even aware of it, and that's why uh, that's why the mormons won by being. adopters because they they were like the leading edge people, they were they were the most sen buse, cults and future religions are filled with both the same type of people, the raw nerve, you know, the the squeaky wheel, the the the the the the more the sensitive, the socially fragile, a person whose ability to absorb the reality is attenuated to a degree that makes their personality. hypersensitive to certain implants and therefore seeking of alternatives, seeking of a different way to be will make life easier for. some of them bed up you know going to go into Guiana and being uh killed with uh poison flavor aid injections. some of them go to Utah and found a flourishing religious tradition that almost got a guy. elected president, but it's the same type of people, uh, mormanism is of course associated most, most closely with Utah, but it was founded in upstate New York uh by Joseph Smith, that's where the upstate New York is where he claims he found the tablets, the gold the golden tablets and upstate New York is also an area that at the time was called the burned over district because of its propensity to to spark massive confligatory religious revivals of different types, mostly protestant, charismatic religious traditions and and uh Joseph Smith was one of those guys and there's act, i always like i've wondered about that, like why why upstate new york, why was that the burned over district? that was also by the way the head the hot bed of anti-masonic uh uh politics, that's when the... asotic party was born, Thurlo Weed who became the uh political major domo for William Seward got his start with the animasonic part, and that was upstate New York, I think it might have something to do with the Erie Canal, hear me out, might have something to do with the er canal, does that make sense? Uh, in fact, there is a, there's a passage in Moby Dick that I want to read. uh, because to me, it really evoked what it must have been like to live in upstate New York, and it makes me feel like, oh, I get why this is a place where religious passions were so deeply felt, uh, so here it is, uh, this is Melville describing uh, the lives of people who are. live in the canal zone where where they put in the air canal um canalers they call them. freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaler would make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and pictureskely wicked is he. like Mark Anthony for days and days along his green turfed flowery nile, he indolently floats, openly towing with his red cheek Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck, but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed the... bringandish guys, the canaler so probably sports, his slouched in gayboned hat betoking betoken his grand features, a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats, his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. once a vagabond on his own canal, i have received good turns from one of these canalers. i thank him hearily, would fain not be ungrateful, but it is often one of the redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has his stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a straight as to plunder a wealthy one. in some gentlemen, what the wildness to this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this, that our wild whale fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our wailing captains, nor does it all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sol transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn field and recklessly plowing the... waters are the most barbaric seeds, so that's part of it is that um is that the canal zone was a was a um, it was a liminal zone, and liminal zones are where social orders dissolve and are turn ephemoral, and that creates social anxiety, it creates a need to find dry land again, because some people are going to say fuck it and go off to the wall. but others of less adventurous temperaments are going to try to find another explanation and uh and and blood and thunder religion is one, it's a way out of the thicket, it's a way out of the of the of the terrifying uh cut-throat dog eat dog savagery of an unrestrained market milieu, which is what the the iri canal represented, buse remember this is 1840s. as before we're talking about any like uh industry is still very much in its infancy, the industrial revolution has barely begun in the United States, this is the closest thing we've got really, anywhere near a uh, i mean other than of course cities, and cities of always been godless dens, but they're very, they're so godless that the the the disorder they produce is very rarely cloaked in religious garb, that's for the countryside, that's where that's where the the the the dough eyed and the and the earnest first confront uh challenges to their uh world and the need to the need to deal with those challenges, the need to bring them down. there's another bit about the um, there's another bit. about there's another bit in that definition or in that chapter which also has this great description of how people from the uh great lakes area are basically uh coastal and have like sea water in their veins and i agree with that but he has one more like paragraph i think about about the religious beliefs in the in that area let's see if i can find it. Here i guys, here it is, this is a description of the canal, for 360 miles. through the entire breathth of the state of New York, through numerous populaus cities and most thriving villages, through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields, unrivaled far fertility, unribaled for fertility by billiard room and barroom, through the holy of holies of great forests, on roman arches over Indian rivers, through sun and shade, by happy hearts are broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those novel mohaw countries, especially by rose, snow white chapels, whoose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life, there's a true ashanti, gentlemen, there houl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you, under the long, long long flung shadow and the snug patronizing lee of churches, for buy some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan free booters, that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most aboound in holiest vicinities, that was the that was the quote i was looking for, that's even better, why did supelers, exactly, the the the the... the the inherent um daily hypocrisy that must be absorbed by all people who both live according to what they imagine to be a religiously prescribed life and the necessity of commerce it creates instability and anxiety and it makes people do if they are sensitive enough if their antenna are ping at the right frequency it makes them do shit like follow a dude to uh illinoy who claims that he's ' read secret god messages on golden tablets that you can't see him, they the angel came and took him away, you i would love to show it to you, but he came, i was like, this is amazing, and then he and then he came, that's the like, it's amazing, it really does tell you that that religion is really fully a it because it has to be an active faith at the at the center of it right, like you have to be able to like, i talked, i talked the other day about the lacuna in your eye where the stock is, you don't have the hole there, because you literally hallucinate something in there, because you know enough, you see enough about what's around it that your brain just like fills in, oh okay, this is what's there, which is essentially what your brain does during any hallucination, at a more like a more intense level is like you're filling in the next step like your brain is imagining something and then it just puts it there because your uh perception is that intensified by the drug uh but so you're you always have to fill in you you're even believing your eyes requires a leap of faith believing in your eyes requires an act of faith and As such, all attempts to make a metaphysical understanding of the universe require that, and so attempting to like defeat religion on those kind of grounds seems foolish to me. You got to, you got to challenge on the grounds of does this religion actually adhere to the values, the universal values, I'm I'm sorry, I'll say it, there is a universal value undergarding all religious traditions of any size. but of course that's not how they're lived, because those are idealist concepts and idealism, idealist concepts are to be molded by material reality, are to be shattered upon the rocks of reality that we then have to pick up, we pick up the pieces and put them back together, and we fuck up when we do it, we miss pieces, we we leave something under the under a couch and it's a little fucked up and messed up and then we hand it off to the next generation, they drop it, they got to do it again, every time something getts lost, something gets moved, but every time the the the the shape is caused by the collision between this idea and this reality, and that's why like American, even though christianity I think has it's heart like as as perfectly stated uh uh uh real like... It's it work it Christianity could is is as true as Buddhism is, I could or close enough for government work at at a certain like root base just in terms of understanding of like the good god uh our place in the universe in relationship to each other, but then we have a thing where people think there's a Disney guy with a beard and you get to go to Splash mountain for eternity after you die. That's not. and what comes from that is this psychotic materialism and the only way to accommodate a real materialist world is through competition ego gratification through competition and resource. grabbing, cooperation is antithetical, even though cooperation is the sum total of human thriving, let's see, somebody says why is buddhism is pretty good, i mean tell that to the Rohinga, you know, it's like it's not like there are buddist like countries where there's like a buddhist super majority that have that are not part of the global. exploitation machinery that do not have misery in the same proportion, because all of these things have been shaped by the material and lost along the way. i think there's a perception buddhism is better because in the United States if you're a buddhist kind of by definition you have not accepted the the the uh the ideological uh issued kit you know. you're you've inherently said, ah no, this isn't for me, because you probably grew up, at least nominally Christian, it requires like an introspection to do that, you didn't just pull it off the rack, and so those people tend to be reactionary or less reactionary, i should say, and so there's association there with with the left, but that's just because just because of the selection bias of becoming a western Buddhist. One evening as the sun went down and the jungle buyers were burning down the track came a hobo hiker. he said boys, i'm not yuring, headed for a land. that's far away sign the crystal fountain so come with me go and see the big rock handy mount how did feudalism uh lasts so long in japan uh i mean i'd be i don't know that much about japan so i'm talking out of my ass people can correct me my my instinct of thought is lack of competition lack of it was a unified state for so long because what broke the feudal, what broke the feudal stailmate in Europe was the black death and then uh the emergence of capitalism out of the trade network that came along with the increased economic activity uh afterwards because of the increase of circulating surplus, the surplus wasn't being horded, it was being circulated, because uh laborers could demand more for their money for the labor because there were fewer of them. and that created a that that broke the uh the relationship, it broke the leverage point between between uh lords and the surfs and it started to it destabilized uh feudalism and also created much more circulating surplus which was then absorbed into a network of trade and of course trade brings a competition or trade is fainal through competition between those medium-sized states i was talking about the Europad which competed with each other and in competing did things like try to find new trade roots after the atomans plugged up the old ones and uh and investing in new uh machinery and uh and and intensifying economic activity and the levels of abstraction within economic activity whereas Japan was a unified state for the entire period there was nothing to uh there was nothing to dis to dis disrupt the the essential uh dynamic between the two classes and then what was it that eventually broke it open? the uh commodor perry in the black fleet but that's just off the top of my ass. i mean the stuff about Europe i'm more uh i'm pretty confident i could defend that but i just i would assume that that would apply to Japan. All right, I'm gonna wrap wrap up in a minute here, if anyone's got any questions, commodor Matthew Perry, can you, could I be any more of an imperial show? uh somebody asks how long till baseball quits? i got to say the fact that they didn't stop after the Marlin's thing happened makes me think they're just going to say fuck it and go forward and i think that the players are too fucking domesticated to push against it because who we got in the NBA or the or the major league baseball now you've got to like all the white guys basically are q dumb asses who do don't think the fucking virus is real in the first place so they have no incentive they don't really care so boom you've got like that's what a third of the players basically ideologically captured, you don't even have to work on their material interest because they don't even know they have any in that context, younger players really have no say, so that's another huge chunk, you know, there's very, and then everybody else, it's like if I going to be the only one says no, then I'm just going to lose out on money and I'm maybe roster spot for the rest of my career. All right, one more question, oh god, this is actually fun, I can't answer it, I just want to think about it as I talk, because it's so good, what if Trump loses, what does his lame duck period look like, part of me thinks he just pushed the button. you know, think about it, he loses really bad, too bad to effectively pull the lever on a coup or whatever, and all of his, and all the top republicans realize he's expendable, and all the military guys realize Biden's not enough of a threat to bother uh, going in with Trump and since he's so unreliable, and then it's like, oh my god, I'm going to lose, I'm going to spend the rest of my life as a failed president who lost in election. and there's nothing more pathetic, that's why winning the presidency is so like so soul destroying and why you have to be a sico to want it, buse winning the presidency makes you one of the most one of the most consequential figures in world history by definition, congratulations, your ego has been put to a size that mortal men can't usually even dream of. on the flip side of that though is that there is no particularly disdained historical figure than the one term president, you are setting yourself off for a humiliation, the the the intensity of which only a handful of people have ever experienced, that's how, I mean, imagine how bad that must feel, to know that you're always going to be remembered as the loser president, like it's not nearly as bad for guys who run for president don't get it, they usually get, it's like uh, it's like chips right, so chips had two guys, the had erica. Astrada and had Larry Wilcox now in the year since then Eric Astrata kind of stayed famous but as a punchline like oh Eric estrata the loser old guy can you imagine him he's trying to be sexy oh that's funny oh look he's on fucking the surreal wife flashing verne troyer in a hot tub oh this is very dignified oh look he's in he's ironically in a uh fucking punk rock bands video in the 90s oh this is hilarious off the radar, just not even known. I think most people, in in terms of show business, unless the real siccos would rather be Larry Wilcox, like that's what being a failed presidential candidate is, but being a failed president, that's being Ericada, and no one gets famous trying to be Erica Austrada, so and and of course we know that Trump has no moral imagination behind himself, he's a fully isolate, that's why he's miserable because he is a fully embodied American, he is the most American American, he embodies america blah blah. we know this, he is he is the he is the manifestation of one so of of all phenomenon condensed into one person as you will occasionally have, he is the Dr. Manhattan of America in that way, so it's not like he's going to feel, oh no, I can't kill anybody, he doesn't think people are real, he thinks in a real way that when he dies the world will end, so why don't just make that happen, and there's really nothing to stop in, you could argue that because it's a uh It's lame duck period, maybe there will be military people there, like maybe they give a special instructions to the football guy to, hey, you know, if there's nothing going on and he just tries to grab the football in the next two months, just tase him, I got to figure those conversations have happened, because it's not, it's not being a lib to point out that he is, he is fundamentally erratic in a way that no president has been really since Nixon, and Nixon was like doing doing... kind of a bit for a lot of it as a siob, even though he was totally bug fuck, nixon was a man, nixon was he was out, he was out there, and so was LBJ, it's kind of a stuff. to think that we survived fucking hide of the cold war with two of the most paranoid miserable freaks to ever be president. both nixon and uh LBJ have recordings uh after their landslide victories bause they both won back to back which is astounding to think or no uh eight years apart which is astowing to imagine that kind of shift uh from one party to the other but though those are almost back to back, two of the biggest blow-outs in American history, uh, but in both cases are uh, in in Nixon's case more, really, uh, they were disappointed in the congressional turnout and the the coat tails and they just, the day after the election they're just kind of complaining about how it wasn't a big enough win, and that's just it's evidence that these people are sick and they cannot be satisfied, they are hungry ghosts. you have to stop them from being able to feed, that's our only hope is a species. see you guys.
