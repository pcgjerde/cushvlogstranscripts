 oh am I on here finally? is it oh there we go, i always feel very very old when i'm trying to start the stream cuuse sometimes it doesn't. go and i had to do it three times and i was like oh boy and so i just i'm like grandpa trying to get the damn vcr at work what's go what where is this oh no embarrassing but i am old i'm a boomer you can call me that i i'm boomy boomy boom boom i'm big boy boomer i remember i remember when vh1 i remember when mtv showed videos and you believe that? yeah, i was right about the world series, i said the dodgers and that made sense because like they've been so cursed right in the last few times they've gotten to the playoffs that what better time for them to win then in the most cursed season, like that is an asteric season, i got to say that seems like a that seems like bad hoodoo, feels like bad hoodu, no thanks. so I was thinking today about how much how Donald Trump is a genius, I talked about a little bit on the show we just recorded uh, and I think it's a good one, but there's a lot of talk about like Trump's murder dumb, and I think when you're talking about like the stuff that you're supposed to be uh, that you're supposed to be doing when you're president traditionally, like the job is the... theoretically supposed to contain, no, he doesn't care about that stuff, and so it doesn't matter. Trump, I mean, if genius is the ability through application of will and ability, shape the world, the into some warped version of the world of the way you want to see it, like that's i would say the genius is when you are able to grab reality through some application of some ability, mental or physical, and some skill, and some just... a deep bottomless desire and drive towards it, a combination of those things is genius as we define it, that's how I define it anyway, Donald Trump is a genius who applied his genius to the singular task of being famous and if you want to get simplistic about it, it's buse his dad never loved him, and honestly that seems cliche, but you know, a lot of the times it could be that simple, I mean when you see his pathological lifelong need to be recognized by others because of an in of this hugely indulged ego that centers a complete absence and a terror of of uh of being bad, of being insufficient, of being unloved and madly he seeks through his whole life to have people talking about him, reflecting well on him so he can fill that all, and he drove himself towards the goal, the singular goal of being famous, however it happened was incidental, like he was genius at business, he was a very bad businessman, but he didn't have to be good at business, in fact his business plan was being famous, he got so famous that once his ability to uh actually manage businesses was revealed to be nonexistent and he started going bankrupt, his name was too valuable to let him actually lose any of that fucking uh position or or equity, because if he didn't own it, well then the hell did, and then dets get called in and the whole thing falls apart, and so his name became this thing that could also be used as a money laundering front, and then also became was able to drive himself towards becoming a actual game show host and that's why he's president and then he ran for president because somebody's he was being talked about but in a negative way and it drove him crazy he needed to drown out that negative thought and he did it by running for president and he wasn't trying and what i'm trying to say is that Donald Trump is a genius because this man who doesn't know or care about any traditional element of becoming a politiciation either from the point of view of having a political philosophy caring about anything politically one way or the other having any any coherent political beliefs at all and then trying to apply them to any subject from economics to civics, ethics, anything, nothing, and then also just like the the job of being a politician of of like conforming to sort of the the media, ecosystem in such a way that you like maintain hom, you don't create too much sparks and and tension and and and hostility, the way that you're able to stay under the radar, stay stay. singular pursuit of fame meant that he became president by accident, he did a thing that some of the brightest minds of American history have sought with their entire body and spirits, many of them have been dashed against the rocks of their own ambition, others of them, few of them have miraculously made it to the ascent to the top, all of them powered by this knowing need to be uh the president, Trump just wanted to be the most famous person in the world and that just met and eventually led him to... by definition becoming the president of the United States, is generally the most famous person in the world, so he wasn't trying to be president, he was trying to be most famous person in the world, and by seeking that so successfully and singularly, he accidentally became president, so Trump's not stupid, what's stupid is any system that could produce that result, any system that would create a political structure that would incentivize and and uh and select for being psychotically good only at getting drawing attention to yourself, but we bungled that, that ship sailed, but I honestly think Trump's done for, uh, and today the real honestly more than any polls I've seen and there been some really eye dropping ones, or eye-popping ones, one that showed that Trump is uh Trump, one people who said they disliked both candidates by almost 20 points in 2016, and right now people who say they dislike both candidates prefer Biden by almost that much, like those are the blate breakers, and the late breakers last time went incredibly far for Trump, way out of proportion, even to uh to historic trends, that's not going to happen this time, almost by definition because he's the incumbant and and traditionally incommants uh uh are not the choice of... late breaking voters, late breaking voters tend to break against incumbants, and then you have the fact that Trump is uh, people that dislike him more than they dislike Joe Biden, unless you're a real psycho trumpist, you don't really hate Joe Biden, and honestly do they even really hate Joe Biden, he's sleepy Joe, they have to make up the idea that he's a puppet of antifa, but most people don't think that because he's sleepy Joe, so they don't even really hate him enough to like drive it uh successfully. and yeah, the covid spike, I mean it was predictable, people all said, brace for a second wave, in the fall, because that's how these things work, and yeah, here it is, I mean, we never got a, it's not, it's our third way, because we unlike a rest of other a lot of other countries allow a they never really ended the first wave, and created like a second wave of the summer, that's the real Trump difference is that, and you might honestly though, if it turns out that we end up having this thing for years and we end up somewhere near. your like actual heard immunity just by incompetence and inability to to do anything else uh it ended up might not being a difference like this you're going to have the same number of dead just like maybe different names but if there is some sort of biden covid plan that's going to turn us around uh that i'm sure we'll see that but the thing is voters even if they don't believe that's going to happen they're going to pick it they're going to pick not this buse they know this isn't working unless you already bought. Trump premises this isn't working, but anyway uh, the real nail and the coffen from mean more than any of the polls uh is the court ruling, specifically the one today by uh, a federal court just judge who is one of the most nakedly partisan uh just uh judges on the federal bench rejecting uh a republican party uh injunction request to have 100% plus uh Harris County votes invalidated because they were collected at a drive-through uh location instead of a fixed polling place uh classic absolutely uh uh fraudulent basis like prima fashi ridiculous but that doesn't matter and the judge today the last hope of this thing he shot it down and to me this is confirming what I suspected which is that the... there is now no question that the uh the apparatus exists within the federal government specifically within its judiciary and it's currently aligned uh state legislatures and key swing states that if there is anything like a close election they republican party has a veto override on the outcome i i think that's true with cony cony 2020 on the bench uh i think it is the have that, the only question is, when would they press that button for Trump, and I say the answer is they wouldn't. Okay, I'm back on, okay, I'm back. I'm back, I'm back, I've not been redacted, but I did lose my train of thought, what was I saying? shit, oh, uh, why they're not going to go out uh, there's two uh, it's essentially a question of how much that they'll be willing to stick their neck out, how much the willing to break norms? now, as I have said, all norms will be broken if they have to be, but it is like an emergency type situation, and will people in power in the Republican Party. in this judiciary and in these state legislatures where there's not as much scrutiny like not no one of them is ever going to lose their job because they fail to stop Biden from winning people will just get mad at the deep state and the media and stuff and they'll get and they will not blame the DOP for allowing it to happen uh I really don't think so they have the freedom to to operate off of their self-interest as members of a party click which is they what they are which are independent from the interest of Trump and Trumpism which is entirely based on his personal uh uh uh not. even political objectives, personal like mood objectives and that there's no reason that they would want to have to spend being the party in power during a giant recession and continued covid crisis, dealing with this guy's ego is the soul basis for party policy, especially since they got what they wanted out of him, judiciary locked up, the veto in place, if there ever comes a point, like say Bernie was on the ballot this time, and it was closer for some reason, and there's a few jump states, they would press that, they'd mash that button, you wouldn't even have, it wouldn't be a question. to people mashigan, everyone would come spontaneously to the decision, the self-interested decision that this is what we're going to do, just like there would need to be a big plan before uh, before the 2000 election, as soon as that ball got in the air and it was tipped, they just everyone knew what to do, because everyone knew what the stakes were, at least the republicans, of course the democrats weren't doing that, the republicans instantly wow the stakes were, and that's all you need is everyone understanding the stakes and moving towards those ends at the same time, then you have a spontaneous judicial cu, and that will happen, but I don't think it's going to happen in this election. one because I don't think it's in it for in it for the average Republican judge or Republican legislator for Trump to win really, especially at the at the risk of deepening a political crisis that might eventually snap back in their face, of course there's no real reason to fear the current democratic party, but you can't guarantee what's going to happen, and even the medium term considering how deeply deep the crisis is, I mean some of these people know that, but the other one and the other one is that I don't think it's going to be close enough. would need to have like three or the idea that's all going to come down to Pennsylvania, I just, if that's the case, polling is not a thing anymore, maybe it isn't, but I think you need extraordinary evidence to make a claim, so I'm going to hold off and say for now, since I'm only predicting, and this is why predicting things is stupid, like it's an if then situation, if polls are broken, then Trump will win, but like, well, are they, I don't know, no one knows, you can't know, it's in it's saying, but yeah, predicting. stuff, I talk about how like arguments online are exist is to be had, and some in some cases I think people are aware of that at some level, and I think I hope people are aware at some level that like people predicting who's going to win, that that is purely ornamental speech, uh, but I don't know the way people get invested in it and the way that like they're signaling something by which uh thing they're predicting and how that speaks to their like overall credibility and whatever, even though you're just talking about a snapshot of a moment and there's somebody. and nobody can have confirmed until we get some actual results, it seems like you're uh you're putting your you're demanding too much of this as an emotional uh load star of conversation and and and concern about investing ideas about who it is, i speak for myself, but i i see a lot of people stressing about this stuff, and i usually i've tried not to do too much of it, but it is literally tomorrow, so i'm kind of siking up cuuse i'm going to have to talk about it a lot, and then one way or another, I think there's going to be a big, it's really interesting, so we're not going to get catharsis, no matter what happens, no catharsis, but I also don't think it explosion, but I also don't know if we can continue the level of pitchedness without an explosion, I think the only way to square that circle is if there's some sort of just uh dwarted org. ruined orgasm as they say in the internet and just sort of like a a refractory period, I don't know, I just think everyone's still going to be miserable and tense, there's not going to be any kind of excellation, but there's also like even if Trump wins, there's not going to be some apocalyptic confrontation with the state, even if Trump does a coup, there's not going to be that, there's going to be hypernormalization, but how do we assimilate that considering the level of uh tension, and the fact that people are literally running out of money. running out of money, so there's a real material wick burning away in the background of all this cultural uh frenzy that the election is provoking, and that's the thing that's really driving it, that's the actual engine and it does. appear to be uh that there's any chance that it's going to be extinguished before it hits the fucking uh pile of dynamite lame dump trunk will be very fun lame dump lame dump trump lame duck trump will be funny very funny uh i honestly think that if it's within if it's around nine or 10 points which i think is really reasonable at this point to think of as in term of a uh popular vote gap, I think even with states not declaring right away, I don't think Trump's going to have anything like the ambiguity in the air to even get the wheels spinning, especially when you see these early decisions uh kind of setting the tone, um, but he and so he's going to give it a go, I think, but the thing to remember about Trump, the most fundamental facet of him is that he is a coward, which means that as soon as there's a bit of resistance, he will... crumble, as as soon as he makes a half asked like uh request to like the joint chiefs uh and then they they rebuke him, he will shrivel up like a fucking turtle dick, the fame. this turtle dicks simily? yes, i've got turtle dicks on the mind because i'm always not far from thinking about Mitch McConnell. i it would be funny if he like literally crumbled into dust as soon as uh the new congress is inaugurated like he just he willed his body to stay together long enough to get uh the the judiciary completely zipped up for a generation and then he just transcended the physical fucking realm. Am I not sir, at long last turtly enough for the turtle club, sir, I ask you, have you no sense of turtlehood at long last? I mean, people are going to go a little nutty, that's going to be interesting, uh, but I see the vast majority of these sub'. urban warriors everyone's kind of deciding to freak out about, they're not going to do anything, they're not going to do anything, there might, you might see some uh, some of those awesome like protests like where they drive onto the road and just park their cars perfect, like you can hey go to the drive-in and get a fucking uh get a get a soda and a burger and then just sit there and hank your horn, what the going to storm uh state houses, they're going to raid armories, no they're not going to do any of that. couple of their more unbalanced kids might do some sort of uh Elliot Roger shit, but that's at this point, that's just the background radiation of American life, and then of course you got a factor in domestic gladio, but I honestly think for at least a little bit, I think that the powers of b are going to try to tramp down, like tamping up was good for a while, it was especially good when Bernie was going on, Tamping up was good, but now... "especial, especially considering how high it got, they're going to want to tamp down a little bit, so I wouldn't be surprised if the gladios got turned down, although instead of uh, or the gladios get busted more, and you get just a bunch of uh fake FBI entrantments things like the one they did in Michigan to justify uh, like the state and and like turn the left around on uh on the deep state basically because Hey, we live in reality and these institutions are the only things standing us between us and the ravening mob, the fascist hords, I'm sorry, we have to carrow them. It will be very interesting to see how cube metabolizes a Trump loss, uh, at this point, I'm sure most of them are too far gone. to consider that, oh no, maybe this was a dumb idea, i think some of them will, because you know not everybody is at the same level of commitment and of an imaginative, you know an emotional uh uh identification and transference to it, you know, like people internalize concepts like cute at a point where it's like an identity, once that's the case, nothing can change it because it's too fundamentally existentially terrifying because if you're not that what are you, and that's an question that most people don't want to answer. so it will have to for some good chunk of these guys it's going to have to be turned into something else and it'll be very interesting to see like uh Trump is occluded, is he is he going off? to to summon God's angels and commence like a right like wait for the sign of his return i think that stuff might be a if it is just the modern day gloss on the the the evangelical Christ story then it would make sense that it would it would culminate with like a a figure who essentially becomes the Messiah like Trump is no longer just buse you for for Christians right for self-identified christians their leaders are their ideas of Jesus Jesus and that's one of the big reasons that people said that's so hypocritical for them to love trump so much, but they view Trump is like this embodiment of uh like this bodyment of of all that is worldly and corrupt, but it has like a godly soul, which is of course the fate of all Christians to know deep down that they live debatched and fallen lives, that they are totally slaves to the flesh, slaves to the lives they have, that they don't really have a spiritual sense at all. uh and that they but they seek to transcend that that shadow knowledge and Trump going into occlusion basically him stepping down for power can become some sort of passion play uh that you know will presage a redemptive uh uh resurrection that will then finally abolish the distinction between the world matter and the kingdom of heaven. so I'm looking forward to it if that happens, it'll be fun, uh, everyone has such opinions about daylight savings, I can't, I can't seem to care. I don't know, I kind, I like the fall back, I like the extra hour, I know people don't like that it gets dark early, but that doesn't really bother me, it's not like abolishing the penny, which I am much more passionate about, it's just the symbol of how the the like the the built, the dependency bias of like a large bureaucratic state is genuinely infuriating, it's one of those things that you need to have like democratic controls on the mechanisms of state to prevent. like what it comes down to it, the reason we still have pennies is because there are more people who are more deeply invested in the production of pennies than there are people who are even aware of like pennies as a stupid thing that we shouldn't have, because the it's essentially i think the copper lobby or something wants to maintain demand is a lobby that keeps the fucking that makes sure nobody even comes near the penny and who's going to make the penny their priority and that's what you would need, you'd need enough people to have. make the penny their priority to make it a litmus test of involvement in government or politics and that's just not going to happen because who is what is the vested capitalist interest in not having the penny and since there isn't one it'll just continue forever and that is a small silly example but it it's this rolling ball of of gunk that fills every piston of governance and you know people say that that's that's like oh that's bureaucracy that's the nature of the well no, in this case, in a lot of cases, it's the nature of capitalist capture of the state, like the specific interest capture, that's part of the broader you, assimilation between like ideally, i think from the from the liberal model of the state, not the way it is, but the way they theorize it is that yes, you know, they will admit maybe if you really corner them, all right, yes, liberal, the liberal uh, government, liberal bourgeois government, it really is the executive committee of capitalism, but but I'm a liberal, I think capitalism is good, and if we're going to have it, which we should, we should have it integrated into a system of democratic check that can prevent the colliding and uncoordinated, sort-term interest of specific capitalist concerns from leading to accumulation of uh of um inefficiency and and waste more than anything uh that essentially make the government no longer functional either and and and turn eventually government towards the specific uh uh interests or perceived interests of a smaller section of capital that maybe doesn't know what the fuck it actually does want, maybe it because it cannot see beyond the end of its nose and it brings the whole edifice down and they would say no we don't want that, we want we want uh we want a uh seamlessness there between the interests. uh and and they and checking the emergence of like specific uh capital formations taking power over the overall you know mechanism of government. and conservatives point to that and say no, look, this is bureaucracy, this is bureaucracy, this is this is the doom of the liberal uh, uh uh uh, this is the doom of the liberal conception of state, and liberals only real responses, uh, no, we got to just get rid of the corruption, but it's like, well, where, how, if the whole system is powered by money at every point, and it is just a piston response system of industries uh, you know, engaging with industries and and capitalist individuals in firms and such uh and individually like interacting with the government and producing outcomes that they want for themselves uh eventually wherever there's more concentration of capital there's going to be more concentration of influence and that means there's no way to have the system that you're imagining you can have unless you eliminate profit and you eliminate capitalism from the mechanism and you clear that out of the out of the uh the pistons of the state bureaucracy. so that's like a a central right-wing critique of like the liberal project and once again as with all these things the finger points backward, it's not crony capitalism, it's capitalism, capitalism becomes crony inherently no matter what kind of uh equal uh playing field you're starting from and of course you're never starting from one, just accumulates pockets that then uh self-deal. so even your even your uh idealized liberal state will not be able to prevent specific interests from overwhelming any generalized interest because remember the liberal idea is sure yes it's capitalism, it's it's the it's the executive board of capitalism, but capitalism is just the accumulated choices of people, that's the liberal idea, it's like yeah of course the market should be this the total thing because the market is the expression of choices of people, and therefore what they want to do is what should be done. and therefore the state should just coordinate it and make sure that it's it can exist within like a a a a a safe space of like market transaction, but even on its own terms it fails because of the unequal distribution of uh capital within industries and within interest segments and demographics that buckle it and turn it even away from your idealized notion of a general will that is expressed through the market transactions. you got to get rid of the profit, you got to get rid of the capitals, you have to just, you have to socialize the surplus, you have to socialize the surplus, i would love to be an admiral, someone said general will, admiral matt, what was the other one? Who is Felix gonna be colnel colnel? Yeah, he's he's like a those ops guys, you know, they don't want to be on a desk, so they're not generals generally, maybe a captain even. I'm definitely an admiral. I'm not really cold, it's in the 40's. it really is, I run hot anyway and I grew up in the frozen was so I generally don't get very cold. Can you see my breath? But um, I got to say, a lot of people are wondering what's going to happen in the coming weeks and months and I've decided and it's going to be a little bit cuz I've made a few commitments, I now realize you know uh in the immediate going on some other shows to talk about what i think is going to happen, i'm really hoping though that like after sort of getting it out of my system following this you know this specific pageant that we all get psychially fixated on every two years or four depending on your level of intensity of worship um oh yeah I'm going to stop trying to predict anything cuuse without the election coming up, there's nothing to peg it on, it's all vaguely in the future, and so there's less of a pressure to specifically opine on things going to happen, so I'm going to try as much as I can, I'm going to make a conscious effort to reduce my amount of predicting things, because it really is uh, it's catnip, it's it's it's a it's a uh, it's It's an analgesic for the brain, people are saying is chapo going to be funny under bidon, I honestly think it's going to be a whole new, I know this is self. serving, but if byne wins, there's going to be some high jinks cuz like he's going to be president, you know, his brain is jelly, he is so out to lunch, and in a completely different way than Trump is, which means we're not going to get you know, it's not going to be boring, it's just very funny, and then the fact that they're gonna have to dress up whatever like uh, monstrous neoliberal regime they're going to do out and like uh like inclusive woke language and the army of people who are going to try to do it on its behalf and the number of people who are going to go from like prison abolitionists to like talking about working within the system and understanding like what the realm of the possible is oh that's going to be finger looking good seriously they're going to be so many people who who couldn't support Bernie because he didn't he was like against he wasn't for reparation. or some bullshit are going to be fucking bending over backwards to defend this old white man imposing this austerity uh authoritarian neoliberalism it'll be it'll be worthy foutder for japes and amusements i think and the way they're going to like have kamala out there to try to like remind people hey there if you it's not it's not it's not this old skeleton there's a new there's a new bottle i'm gonna we're going to do a ritual dance is like the spirit of the party is going to infuse me and now it's going to be all bouncy and inclusive to match our messaging even though the actual policy is the same uh cheese grader to the soul that uh we will be subjected to no matter what man i got to say that that video of uh of of Schumer saying, I got, I heard about this veteran who lost his job to COVID and then got his house taken away and killed himself, and how is a result we're going to introduce legislation to require polices, to require and fund uh local police to do uh self-harm interventions? I mean, this is this is the ratched effect, it's like you make life on... intolerable and then conditions of intolerability create uh you know pathologies and then you you put all of your energy into fighting these things that are direct out growths of the system like look at fucking france like look at macron macron is doing one of the most disgusting and cynical fucking pieces of politicking i've seen in a long time i honestly say more like self-consciously evil than almost anything trump's done uh so the boy the boy wonder what? knows that he is on a knife's edge, that he is like the the the the opinion poster man for this, this unbridled neoliberal state that is like coming for the french way of life, like they're fighting, but they're coming for it, and the resistance to that is, it's it's it's not polarized along from right to left culturally, like there's a big right wing of it, like like the front national, and then you got melanchon and stuff, and macron knows that you know the French love... love picking somebody to fix this intractable crisis, uh, not do anything, and then get very mad at them and throw them out, and he doesn't want to be that, he doesn't want to be chump bait, so what he's doing is he has decided to declare war on like a separatist islam uh, in order to polarize that right-wing populism towards him and demobil and and and uh and undermine the the the the risk that uh the national front in Marine Lepen who were Lepen was the uh opponent in the last the runoff opponent to the winner in the last two presidential elections and and I think got a significantly larger vote the second time, he saw the writing on the wall, potential, the arc of that, and he wanted to interrupt it, very much like Cameron deciding to do a Brexit vote to neutralize Yukin, cynical manipulation of a cultural problem that is caused by the fact that uh I mean yeah, there's like cultural issues with France in uh assimilating anybody, but there's this fundamental perpetuating uh uh neoliberal austerity and specifically the fact that like that french you know uh way of life was never really extended to um Muslims who came to France and and they exist as a economic underclass and these things cannot and will not be addressed instead you h hit the beehive with a stick to get everyone freenzied to to to essentially make uh any kind of class project impossible and now like shit horrible. It's going to happen, like the guy gets killed, a teacher gets killed, there's attacks and people say, well look at this, is this proof he was right, it's like, well, he's right that there is a problem that he literally is completely invested in not doing anything about, except to profit from the creation of it, monetizing the rot politically. someone says uh, do I think that Chapo would have been funnier if Hillary had won? I know that that's what we thought at the time because we had basically prepared for Hillary winning and had a had an idea what to do with it. Uh, I don't know, I mean she's very funny, but she's also kind of she's got um, she's got X-pock heat, you know what I mean, and yes, some of it is, some of it is gendered, I'm not, I'm going to admit, but it's not entirely like. Hillary Clinton has a transparent hatred that she hides behind a screen of fakeness that is so revolting to me anyway, and yes it's probably gender to a degree, but it's it's I feel it like resonating like off like my feelings and I don't know if that would have like made it less amazing over time or if that would have made it funnier I don't know uh I do think we did pretty good making fun of given the business to the old uh orange uh the old the old Mango Mussolini the old. chito and chief uh the saffron uh the saffron sattrap, i don't know uh, but we're going to find out if making fun of you, the uh the walkification of neoliberalism uh will be as funny. I mean, I do think that the the the hairpin turn that's going to happen with the maximalist rhetoric around around around identity issues that has been whipped up, like the anotion that we are in this like hell hole of white supremacy that requires immediate revolution and that you can't reform this, I think that is going to pop and watching the fallout from that is going to be uniquely entertaining. and seeing the entire media try to act like not only as this decrepit old man uh some sort of uh civil rights icon and uh and uh slay queen but uh that he's not mentally incapacitated because you got to figure. he's they're not going to be able to do, I mean Trump proved that you don't actually have to do anything to be president, I mean he watch TV all day like they could put him in front of a TV, it wouldn't even have to be on, um, but you still have to give speaches, you know, and you still have to do semi-regular contact just to like shape the narrative, because you know you're the one everyone looks to, and that's going to be a lot of stress on the breakpads, he's going to be smoking. and you'll have an entire and the media will be very funny to watch to watch these guys who spent the last four years uh doing the whole uh resistance insurgence thing you know descent is patriotic uh deciding that the deep state uh that the that the police uh the police power of the United States is now legitimate oh man that's gonna be funny. Biden was pretty sharp in the debates, although the first one he was really blown off the blocks by Trump and then he had a very hard time uh centering his like stream of consciousness. I don't know, it's like he next to Trump, I guess it's okay, but he really does get he can you see in his eyes. he doesn't know where he is, i guess i would say, and that happened multiple times during the debates, like you could there there would always there was there's these moments when you know you're arguing it's like answer the question and uh somebody will like have to be like wait what was the question cuuse you know it was a long clause he would have those moments but you could tell it wasn't about what the question was it was like deeper than that it was where am i what is this like he was having to go he was having to like collect himself more than just what question were you asking? like there's no there's no adherence to anything other than the very narrow tunnel in front of him. he has this way that he like tries to name three things and by the third one he just runs out of gas. he was talking. about how uh Trump is inciting racial hatred and he goes praising Charlotte's bill uh telling them they're very fine people building a walls telling mexican's rapists just going out there and doing all kinds of stuff I can't get to a third specific example can't actually engage beyond just the most capaciously nerf-like sentences and and uh and phrases that just it's like a it's like somebody getting like a a diamond ring in a giant box filled with packing peanuts like there like the actual the actual content of the sentences he says even in a debate where people said he was good are just these tiny little kernels and it's just the rest of it's just uh peanut packing peanuts and i don't know how that gets better i wouldn't be surprised if they try to have him step down depending on how like the the whole operation goes, i mean maybe maybe Dr. joe Biden is the 21st century edith Wilson, maybe she's able to lock that shit down, her and like her handpicked chief of staff are able to lock it down, I don't know, maybe the Obama's takeover, maybe Romanuel is the man, maybe the clinton somehow stage a fucking comeback, like uh Hillary sneaks in disguised as a uh as an intern. I do not think that he will run for re-election, that's for sure, as funny as that would be, and I also have to say though, like whatever adrenachrome-based therapies they have for these guys work well, because before the prime, before the uh convention, I was half convinced and a few times was able to fully convince myself that they were going to try to switch him out. because he was transparently not up for the job. I think eventually they realized the COVID kind of covered for a lot of it and they were able to reserve him, they were able to keep him like on the battery savor mode in a way they wouldn't have been able to do. He didn't really do a basement, he was out and about, but like they were able to curtail it in a way they wouldn't have been able to do if it was a normal election. Uh, and I didn't, maybe I didn't anticipate that how how well that would go in terms of not hurting his polling, like I kind of my assumption was as him not being out there was going to hurt his polling, but nope, turns out. out, he's the alternative, all these things are set, all the stuff's baked in, nobody's really considering moment to moment changes really other than at the margins and those people aren't really paying attention to you know how much he talks and what he sounds like and his or his record or anything like that, he's just the not trump option, which i think is going to be the more popular option, and so they got him through, they're going to get him through election day, i don't know the rigos of the office, like i said, it might not be rigorous, but It's going to be a question of the power dynamic that emerges in the white house and that's the thing I can't know so once again I'm see I'm still I'm still predicting things I'm still fucking predicting things I said after the election though so the election still happened it hasn't happened yet I'm getting it out of my system I'm trying to use this week to squeeze all the fucking toothpaste out of my tube and leave me a dry husk you know I thought I think Jim Carry's uh Joe Biden and is actually a decent impression of Joe Biden, like he kind of has the same croky voice and uh and uh like some of the same intinations as him, the difference is is that he is much more coherent than Joe Biden, which is why it's not a funny impression, and the reason it's it's it's not good as like an impression for something like SNL is, because impressions are supposed to exaggerate things to make them funny, instead what Jim Carry has done is he has taken all the absurd things about Joe Biden and sanded them down into a less terrifyingly uh uh incoherent uh like like uh a friendly grandfather like they literally had him do uh uh the Fred Robinson uh Fred Robinson uh the the Mr Roger shit with the fucking like they're they're they're not trying to say wow isn't that they're trying to like enforce that that's manufacturing consent because the SNL writers are and cast are... in a in an unprecedented fashion uh, just clearly doing propaganda on behalf of the Biden campaign, because they literally brought a guy in who's known for doing big wacky exaggerated uh stuff to do a version where Joe Biden is boringly coherent and maybe it'll just maybe he maybe he wanders off a little bit grandpa, but you know at the end of the day he's still he's still sharp as attack, he's spry, I mean that's a that's a... that's serving a campaign function, of course, maybe it's just the fact that like they already don't really exaggerate anything about Trump uh for uh Baldwin, but that's because you can't exaggerate Trump, I think you can exaggerate Biden, or you could at least not do the opposite of humor, with the character, like this are trying to be funny with Trump, they're deliberately not being funny with the Biden impression, they're putting their fucking thumb on the scale, and the thing is, it's like, if you're a conservative, I can see why that's alienating and allows you to feel like you're oppressed, and of you're not. pressed, but I can understand why seeing like all of the TV stations of which we only have a fined number, all the things that have like a a a cachet of mainstream culture and are accessible across like a broad demographic, are all in alignment against you, I mean that's why they get, I can see why they go crazy over it, yeah like. uh, that's why the good impressions of Trump, uh, not mine cuz I do try to exaggerate it, but I'm trying to just like do a soul, I'm just trying to do a soul impression, people are trying to like make it sound like him, you can't make it sound like him more, make it funnier, you can just sound like him and then it's what you talk about, and it's just doing a, it's it's having his words come out of the mouth of someone else, and about something else. folks, can't do it, he's so good, scoop do, he's dooby do, but he doesn't do, i have kept up with the good lord bird, still have not warmed to it, uh, i guess i see what it's trying to do, it's not terrible, i just haven't really found a terribly. engaging, like forgetting any ideological or historical issues with it, i have found a lot of uh, just the stuff isn't very interesting, i mean it just doesn't, it doesn't interest me as a gloss on the material, which you i'm familiar with, like i'm not really learning a lot here, so it's a interpretation and i'm not really grabing, it's nothing that grabs me, the come lord bird, come on, that's chat, come on, i think we're better. than that, very, very crude, fargo, uh, ooh, terrible, really bad, uh, uh, yeah, pretty impressively bad, no, this season is bad, hush up. Sprinkles, not Jimmies, I'm not a southerner, I'm not a southron. I don't know, there's like nothing I like about. like the fargo season, i don't like the heavy-handed way that it plays its uh, its themes, i don't like a lot of the performances that like that, italian brother is like he's in a silent movie and chris rock is not a good actor and never has been, he's a stand-up comedian, and the characters aren't interesting, i don't know, i'm not a fan, If Trump wins, revolution, no, to put it lightly, no, the one thing I know is that if Trump wins, it will be by stealing it, but that... no matter how if he successfully steals it, it will be uh not metabolized as a coup, it will have a patina a fig leaf of legitimacy enough so that has outraged as people get, they will for the most part talk themselves off of the precipice of doing anything about it, because at the end of the day they are relatively comfortable, only in the sense that they would perceive their precarity more than anything they could win out of. some sort of apocalyptic confrontation with the state, but I think that uh anything that would like actually look like a coup to the point where it could not be met. just cancelled election, guns in the streets, that kind of thing, they wouldn't do that, like I said, the forces that would do that are not invested in Trump enough to do it on his behalf, so it won't happen. Ah, walkershaw Wisconsin, uh, fascinating place, so Crucial Walkershaw County, as it's called, is one of the GoP strongholds in Wisconsin, it is the county directly west of Milwaake, and it is the white flight uh, headquarters, uh, it is where everybody went in the 60s, uh, uh, once uh. the blockbusting within city neighborhoods was uh successful and they are uh very concerned about public transit out there, they really don't like the extension of bus lanes, they really don't like the idea of any of metropolitan rail system, we had we had a mayor in Milwaaki who was like kind of a mini uh daily there, he was got he was mayor for like 16 years his his machine ran the city, his name was uh Norquist and his single policy objective of his fucking 16 years in office was to extend some sort of light rail system connecting the suburbes to the city, and it was the providing political project of the generation politicians that Scott Walker emerged out of actually, the guys around Mark Belling and uh like the talk radio and uh and uh like walkshack county republican uh uh political uh leader you know uh formation uh and and they vote a lot they vote their votes coming suspiciously late sometimes uh and they off they often form the uh the margin in in a lot of like off year races and stuff like uh especially supreme court which is lamentably elected in Wisconsin which means for a long time uh right wing uh would just buy it by uh spending more on ads than the democrats could raise once again because they know the stakes and um but yeah it's very racialized as you could imagine Milwaaki being one of the most violently segregated big cities in America, I think number one by many metrics. I i went to college there. but of course like it's been uh diversifying a little bit recently, the irony of irony is there uh for me is that so wakkinshaw was originally a resort town, it had a it had a a system of hot springs so people would come and take the waters uh and Albert parsons actually one of the haymarket marters after the hey market bombing fled Chicago and he was hiding out in mil wakashaw uh before he turn himself in but uh there was a uh like a a water war with uh Chicago over the waters, the hot springs from Walkershaw and it saw like armed confrontations over people uh digging pipelines, and now 100 years later, not only are the springs all gone, or if they sure as hell don't know if there's anywhere you can go and take them if you can, uh, but the water table is contaminated with raidon and they want access to Milwakee. water, the place that they fled, the county right next to the lake that has access and and privilege to wake water thanks to the great lakes compact, which is to prevent any areas outside the immediate contact area of the great lakes from accessing it in the coming thirsty times, and now they want, hey, you know, we like fled and took all of our uh tax money with us and created a hyper segregated social corridor, sanit. there that we heavily policed, can we get some of your water please? ours is all gross. well, the water work. between places that currently have access to great lakes, places that want it, like for example fucking Arizona, arizona wants great lakes water and the great leaks. compact is a is a regional agreement to prevent that from happening, but yeah, I don't think that's going to stop it from getting uh privatized and and purchased at some point. All right guys, I hope everybody's excited for tomorrow, I hope everybody's ready to take a fucking uh potato peeler to their frontal lobe one way or the other metaphorically uh by absorbing and absorbing and having wash over you the results of our magnificent democratic pageant uh, we will probably, I kind of think we will not, we will not have a call, there will be no check mark, there will be no call on election night, because I think the the media is so neurotically fixated on not accidentally helping Trump fucking do a coup that they're not going to do that, uh, but I think that you will probably know before you go to bed who want, if it's Biden. That would be my prediction, and I would say that since I think, like I said, I think
