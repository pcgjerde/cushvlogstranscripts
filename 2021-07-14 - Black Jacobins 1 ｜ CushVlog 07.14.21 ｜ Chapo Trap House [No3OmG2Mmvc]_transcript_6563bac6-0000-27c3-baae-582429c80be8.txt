 uh-oh, not a networking air, oh there we go, no more networking here, just about a year ago, went out on the road, saking for fame and fortune, looking for a party goal, things got back. and things got worse, i guess you know the tune, oh lord, the stuck and low die again, road in on a grey hound, i'll be walking out if i go, i was just passing through, must be seven months all. I ran out of time and money, looks like my plans fell through, oh lord, I'm stuck in low die again, should probably do this button, don't want to be too erotic out here, so today. we'll be talking about the first three chapters of black chacts, which is terribly enjoyable book and very well read. James is a great pro stylist, which is pretty rare among historians and you got to give it up when you find it. uh, it seems like there are a lot of the sweet spot really does seem like the 30s for a lot of that like really uh uh pros uh poem prose poetic history where it's like you know you're getting you're getting a synthesis you're not getting you know an academic tredis but you are getting also a work of literature and i would put this among here uh another book that i would recommend for anybody who wants to read something like that is CV Wedgewood's book on the 30 years war uh just to just delightful incredibly easy to read and that's difficult but with uh with uh which this with this sort of history like reconstruction for example, reconstruction is a great book, but you know fahner is he is trying to build like this this house of evidence you know and like stack up this narrative, it's more workman like whereas this is more uh frankly artistic. which is something that's gotten squeezed out of uh history honestly as it's become more and more specialized and professionalized you know the creation of the academy as such, especially the neoliberal academy, the academy of you, constant production in order to get uh these few sinatures, sinacures, senacures, it's it leads you to the point where you're just uh, you're just pointing at things, or you're just throwing out words that you know people want to hear. two, three, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, all right, kick that one around, yeah, all right, so we'll probably do, we'll do the next three for next week, same. Wednesday, no, no, we won't be doing it wednesday, next Tuesday, probably uh, that'l be the next three chapters, so the first chapter of uh James's book, which was written in. as I said, and another thing that distinguishes it as a product of that time in addition to its pro style is the fact that James is clear. really uh operating in in a polemic mode, he's trying to use explicitly use the story of the Haisian revolution creating a historic narrative, you know, conjuring a a vision of this thing that did happen uh in the moment of uh colonial, the first inklings of colonial upheeval uh in the periphery uh buse world war one like... fatally wounded the empires of Europe, but it took World War II to to doom them finally, and in that inner war period is when you saw the first real explosion of coordinated anti-imperial activism in the in the empire, and CLR James is from Trinidad, which is part of the British Empire. And he wrote this book as uh an explicit. parallel for the times, and he is, he is at several points in the book, analogizes the slaves of santoming to the rest of African and Asian and latin American uh subjects of the European imperial system, and that their task was the same that the Haitian slaves was, that they were to complete the historical mission begun by the... slaves uh and that the context of the incipient war in Europe that was uh that was on the horizon for everyone to see uh would be the cause of that or would be the opportunity like the world the crisis in the in the in the in the capitals of Europe that was occurring as Hitler was continuing his bringsmanship towards the Poland invasion. uh, that is analogous to the conflict among the the whites of San Domingo, and what ended up happening is is along those lines in that it was the war that led to the creation of the first really organized, effective uh military uh insurgencies against empire, and you saw uh, Algeria. uh, Vietnam, of course, uh, India, obviously, uh, Kenya, Cuba of course, and that uh process did lead to a a sort of liberation, you know, but it was the same stunted liberation that the... Hations got, which is they were able to secure their independence as a nation among nations, but cut off from capital and doomed to be a a a client state of more powerful capitalist governments in the things that in the in the uh the the trade system that took over for colonialism and perpetuated the colonial relationship, that's what the cold war is, it is the it is western capitalism. imposing itself as the post-colonial uh imperial authority that maintains the maintaining the relationship, the economic relationship between uh the periphery and the metropoles of the old empires that were no longer uh affordable that had to be uh gotten rid of, and Haiti got that, Haiti got independence, but it was cut off from all trade to the United States which refused to. recognize it until the civil war uh forced to pay billions of dollars, billions with a b in uh reparations to France for the for committing the crime of self-liberation, because they could, because france could do that, and the post colonial third world became a place where every country was a Haiti and that they had independence formally within this... state formation, but then they were still stuck in the capitalist structure and forced to uh to trade on the capitalisms demands, which means cheap uh goods to the center, labor, difficult, painful labor, extractive labor, to the to the periphery, relatively milder labor and surplus from the periphery to the center, that relationship. was perpetuated by the global brettonwood system that was imposed after the war, because the west could do it, because Russians stopped fighting and allow them to uh dictate terms and doomed the Soviet project in the long run. unless they were willing to actually fight for it, which they weren't. um, and so, as in Haiti, you saw the development of, instead of a liberated population, a uh, a system where a few wealthy families in Haiti were able to uh, secure positions as colonial operatics of western c and then operate the extractive economy of Haiti, with the same coersive mechanisms that were in operation with the colonial authorities, not with the name of slavery anymore, but with a similar relationship between the government and its ruling class that backs it, and the actual mass of people of Haiti, and then political history is is. is is a story of fight it's within these concentrations of power broken up occasionally by us military intervention uh the United States occupied Haiti for I believe it was from the Wilson administration until hover I think like 19 uh I think 19 uh 14 or something until 1931 someone can correct me on that uh and That's completely forgotten, no one, literally nobody knows that uh, and in the United States, like a fraction of a percentage of Americans know that, or honestly would care if they did, you know, that's the thing about all this history stuff, uh, it isn't really true that if only people knew, it's like they would just process it through their pre-conceived ideas and what they think they want, and then they would get the same answer, it's not the fact that uh does something, it's the fact in context, it's the narrative built, which is what James is trying to do, build a narrative, could be persuasive that can carry you through battle, but that occupation, as you can imagine was incredibly brutal, like this is America at the absolute height of its race hatred, america's American racism in terms of like as a social uh value reached its uh uh absolute apogy in America uh in the uh early 20th century because of the stresses of the great migration. because race race hatred was concentrated in the south because that is where blacks were concentrated and it was the breaking of those geographic bonds and mass entrance of of blacks into urban areas that triggers this this massive explosion of race violence you had 1919 the red summer which is a series of incredibly bloody race riots that occur all throughout uh American cities, and that is, that is the latent racism, of society at that point, being put under strain, put under pressure, and you see this explosion, and so you see racism become, for the first time this nationwide self-conscious pursuit, which is why you see the second clan at this port, and this is why you have, you have the clan running the state government of Indiana through the... party, that is how detached from the the traditional regional uh racial obsession that characterized white society there had bled out into the whole country um and it was a crisis that was fundamentally solved first by as always repressing uh and policing uh black people and and and and enforcing segregation in the land and in the cities too uh in order to uh you know relieve white anxiety because you know they are they do not have representation in the system and so they can be used that way without it uh affecting the decision making of actual governors because it doesn't matter to them they're not at they're not at uh beholding to them at all, but then what led to this, what allowed the civil rights movement to happen and for that racism to kind of push away enough to allow for something like the civil rights movement and then the civil rights acts and and formal secret segregation being abolished everywhere were was the surplusses of the post-war era, it was the good times provided for by the establishment of this global post-colonial structure of a... This is all a tangent to say that America's most racist army occupying for over. decade uh the first and only black republic in the western hemisphere, my god, it was brutal, it was monstrous, it was, it was a, it was a government organized lynch mob, running a country, and then we leave and leave, propped up those people who were more committed to the project of being rich than to any... national uh, any kind of solidarity beyond their own disgusting inbred families, which is how you see reproduced in this in the the free slave republic the same social dynamics that existed in the the uh the the uh colony. i mean, do you think that the the ruling families of Haiti have any warmer feelings for the masses of porto prince than uh, than the fucking... old planters did for the slaves in the field and then we propped up the duvalier family as a literal client uh gang to run the country on our behalf and then when they first and then when uh and then when uh Steed gets in there and starts destabilizing the the power structure and introducing you know regular uh hatiens into politics and changing the equation uh he had to go. It's amazing we we they they uh Jean Paul Aristed was overthrown by American trained uh military guys on behalf of the ruling families of Haiti then we put him back in power, I think this is because uh, more than anything it triggered a big uh refugee crisis in Florida that was not something that Bill Clinton wanted to see, and so they figured we put Aristeed back in, but because we did it, he owes us, but then he got too big for his britches again, and we fucking kidnapped him, we kidnapped him and dropped him in the central African Republic, we claimed that uh, asked us to do that for him, but he says that didn't happen, and it's who you going to believe, I guess, maybe he's just trying to save face, but even if he didn't, it's another case where we just uh, went in there to unilaterally decide who's in charge, and now the uh, US-backed president who has been triggering massive street demonstrations for refusing to leave. office and is worrying a lot of powerful people in Haiti that he might trigger a revolution, gets murked by merks, maybe from Miami, including FBI informance or are they pats, either way it seems like, and now we have Hasians in government asking for America military intervention and the US saying that they're wearing it. the development plan that the US has made for Haiti in the last 20 or so years since they uh since they since the duvalies fell really uh was to interven enough in Haiti to establish the the uh governmental legitimacy and uh infrastructure uh to carry out a process of uh restructuring. around uh um factory labor, essentially turn Haiti into uh one of those uh sweatshop countries in Asia uh which had been prevented by that point because Haiti didn't have strong enough really institutions to pull people off the land. I mean, they had uh done a good job of destroying the agricultural sector through uh the dumping of American uh... subsidized agriculture into the thing, same thing they did in Mexico and elsewhere uh to destroy their domestic uh uh agricultural sector, but it was hard to get private investment to into the kind of capital intensive uh uh capital intensive operations that you would need to um that you would need to actually get a lot of labor out of the... Haiti's uh urban slum population uh, it was there wasn't enough infrastructure around it to make that uh of a decent investment and so the UN and the fucking Clinton Foundation. has spent the last few decades trying to uh uh proletarianize the uh the lumpin population of protoprints, but you got to figure even if the US doesn't invade Haiti, this moment allows for some sort of transition of power. that everyone can cross their fingers and hope will tamper down the the uh anger in the streets uh and maybe it will, i mean ch that's what that's why we have elections is to get people riled up and then have their uh their uh pent-up anger released through the uh emotional spectacle of a changing of power like you have to do it if you don't do it eventually they overthrow you you lose the mandate of heaven, unless you have a little fake e change every four or eight years, or after somebody gets shot in their fucking bed. okay, so this is all back, all bring us back to the first chapter of the black Jacobns, which is about the uh, experience of being a slave in French Santos, and his main uh, James's main goal here is to give you a true sense of the horror of it, of the genuine of the misery that it inflicted on humans, and and that and the misery that that uh, that then shaped the culture around that uh, um and part of the thing that makes it so brutal is how James repeatedly uh highlights the fact that uh shorne of the mystifications that you'd have in a in a bourgeois a fied like uh developed country like England or or even France at that point uh where of course you have brutality you have brutal uh class segregation and you have oppression and filth and misery but there is also a "there is a a ritual around it, you know, there are rituals of obligation around it that cloud everything and that make it feel more uh, more consensual because it is, because people have like a shared experience that makes them invest in the world around them even the parts that are serving their oppression because they don't, they can't recognize the difference, that is how we build our consciousness, it's not that that the reason false consciousness isn't'. uh term is that it implies there is such thing as a true consciousness, there's not, false consciousness is just a shortcoming from when that consciousness, which is always false, is false in a way that hinders class consciousness. buse class consciousness is also false in that you're picking a group of people to identify with psychially that is fundamentally arbitrary, but it's arbitrary in a way that moves the... fucking wheel of history, because we're all just guessing and being pushed towards outcomes, by the grinding of the gears of history, that's it, so for James, because colonial plantation agriculture is capitalism shorne of all of its attendent mysteries, you get the purest expression of interests of people operating from a belief only in their own most selfish indigent conception of pleasure because the thing about the thing that distinguishes plantation slavery most of all uh from capitalism as it was being carried out in like the burjoning merchant capitals of Europe and North America. uh oh fuck i can people are really talking about whether or not haiti should become a state oh brother they would never do that because the... trying to do it at the minimum of cost, they're trying to and then standing the place up as a sweat shop is the lowest uh capital input, cost way too much to make a state f'. I was saying something about what the uh fundamental difference between those two forms of capitalism were, but then I just lost it. Oh, this is it, is that capital is not reinvested. When the merchants of the cities of of Boston and London, when they met profit on a venture, they maybe had a a nice. you got the land, you got the slaves, if you have sugar, you have the sugar processing facilities which are relatively high investment, but for like indigo. or a cotton plantation or or uh rice, you've got a couple of buildings basically, and you are not uh, you're not a corporation, you're just a guy, you're just a guy, and you probably honestly are in a lot of debt, so all your money goes to repaying your debt and then spending it, on fancy, fancy gloves and and uh wines, a way to create the illusion of civilization in a place where you're just sitting in a fucking dark field forcing someone to work for you and that consumption rice is more complicated because it is more uh labor intensive but remember if you have slave labor uh the that's a different uh uh cost dynamic it's not as capital intensive is what i meant. and so that is why you have the colonial uh uh, that's why colonial and uh then slave places are more backwards, less developed, more just savage uh, and the culture that they produce is more savage, and uh, that is because everybody here is just living by their material in the narrowest sense desire uh interests and of course that's why they were destroyed, that's why the slaves were able to defeat them because they were everyone was operating out of this base material uh interest and at the end of the day there were too many slaves whose base material interest was freedom uh and those motherfuckers at a certain point they couldn't even agree with they wanted and so they were doomed and you see again and again the the the uh the planter class dooming themselves uh in the long-term for short-term advantage. so the first chapter is is mostly about the misery of the slave uh and how it made san domengo a miserable place uh but then a second chapter owners which is about the whites of san demang uh really goes very far the great pains to show uh that the misery uh of the colony was felt in both halvs because well of course the the the whites were all uh living lives of relative pleasure and lesure, they were also uh creating a culture of absolute miserable uh nasty brutishness, they were living as pigs, they were living as pigs and crovates, and so this mas this this rather than like the the dream of the like the the southern aristocracy was always that uh being a slave owner and you could spend all day doing philosophy and reasoning and and figuring out ideal forms of government and and contributing to the general good because somebody else is doing all the shitwork and and you are you your mind was better spent there cuuse you were more advanced you were uh smarter and therefore more valuable your time is more valuable but the colonists showed that that is absolutely not what happens uh in in in amongst the absolute brutality of of American and Caribbean slavery. unlike anything that happened that existed in ancient uh ancient Greece, there is no culture, there is no culture, there is just this savage groteskery, the whites of Haiti really do remind you of like the more carnivalesque grotesques of our of our ruling class. but because it's uh, it is disconsion within the white ranks that helps lead to the revolution, james uh takes pains to point out that there are different groups of white people uh in the same domain, different classes, you had the planters who actually own the plantations uh, many of them uh down, downwardly mobile uh aristocrats basically. uh people who were uh maybe the disinherited second son of a family uh from a rural maison whatever the fuck uh who could uh get the family name back some some stature by uh making money in the in the uh the third world the big whites they were called and there was very few of them uh but they had the vast majority of the wealth of the of the plantation of the uh of the colony. then you had uh the small whites, the administrators, the overseers, the lawyers, the shopkeepers, the people do are doing jobs that could not be uh given to slaves, because the education necessary to have them do those jobs would make them too dangerous to let them do those jobs, so those jobs had to be done by white people, and that is where you get the real uh uh drags of society, the white drags uh, who aren't trying to rebuild a family name with money they have or money that they could borrow, but are just trying to find any kind of uh employment, and of course to say drugs is not to say like the fact that they uh were poor made them bad, it it just meant that they could not continue to expect to live in France and not have life just get worse and worse over time. so Haiti was their chance to do that, and uh, there they were of course the the people who were most devoted to um the color line, because as James points out, racial segregation or a racial segregation of like of of spaces and uh and of prescribed rights based on a race was not uh, did not emerge instantly. uh uh there were no early regulations or statutes about race in uh Haiti uh it was over time over the course of the 1700s uh that that comes into play as the the small whites insist that if they're going to be in Haiti here taking this shit in this place where they're risking yellow fever all the time and going to be at the beck and call of these these fancy people then they have to be... assured that they're never going to have to do any of the real work, that that is a that there is a prescribed group who who will take that labor, and that makes them feel less precarious, because precariity is the driver of all middle class political activities, not solidarity, precarity, because they cannot, they're not a they're not class conscious, they are self-conscious because are the product of liberalism, they are the purest product of liberalism is the middle class, and their precariity in this point drove them to assert a color line that led to the creation of an incredibly intricate array of legal rights that are distinguished based on percentage and fraction of uh of black blood, stuff that is absolutely absurd, and and and to think that people sat there and wrote this stuff down and took it seriously is, it is, it's it's grimly kind of funny because of how ridiculous and in the bosom of the enlightenment these people do in this thing uh, but it was necessary, uh, it was required to maintain the social strata, because you needed those whites there, and that meant you needed that line there. but that that relationship is complicated by the fact that you have this other group uh what James calls uh the Malados uh the colored population uh, the the the products of uh European and and African reproduction, and because of the very very small number of whites in the colony, and the need for people in an intermediate uh position that is not slave, but is not really master either, because there's some jobs a master can't do, but you can't have a slave do, and so you need whites for some of them. but for others you need uh someone who is outside of uh, full citizenship, but enjoys a privileged position relative to slaves, but then therefore will feel their precarity, and so you get the uh the colored population, people who uh are the product of relationships, consensual or non-consensual between uh slaves and uh whites who... are not uh who are freee upon birth and are able to uh buy property and that puts them in a position where even though they get they don't have equal uh legal standing to whites they are uh and they have to they're forced to perform uh compulsory military uh service in slave patrols that white people don't have to didn't have to do uh but they're not slaves. and they're more aware of the danger becoming a slave than they are inspired by the thought of being uh equal and so but in this is why these systems are so ingenious and the way they emerge is so organic uh the colored population is adheres to the uh white population uh and not the not the black slave. because they can own property, because they can, they are uh, connected materially to the interests of the slave economy, they can own slaves, they can work in in in the colonial economy, that depends on slavery, they can make money there, they can lend money there, and so they have a material interest that is with slavery even though slavery treats them as their social guarantee of not doing slave work and that is and that's that is what keeps these systems going from from the middle area from the from the... uh sense of uh, a different sense of best interest, a different sense of material interest, that means that instead of going towards despair and rage, which is what happens when the middle class sees that it things can't get better within the current system. Solidarity allows you to think that no, well we can overcome this system and replace it with something whereby we don't have to fear falling anymore and that that feeling is a more is a superior um social mechanism for uh seasing political power than just middle-class precarity by itself. because what fascism is, and I think we we are in a post-fascism where we're inside a cone of misery and despair, and that means everybody within that framework of American liberalism, which includes the entirety of the Republican and Democratic parties, as in people who adhered to a liberal world where they believe the capitalism is eternal, that. that is talking about, if you're republican or democrat, not talking about how you feel about anything, I'm talking about what's the systems that you're part of and the systems that you ritually engage with and psychologically engage with, what? they represent, those parties represent holes within one reality where capitalism is immutable and everything is going to get worse forever, that is the world that everybody within the bubble of American politics lives now, and our politics is an expression of that, and if you really believe that, then politics can only serve, as a vessel for revenge against somebody whose fault it is, because the fault cannot be, the fault has to be assigned, and then if you can act, you can only act by destroying, and the difference is how much have you displaced your own sense of guilt and responsibility within this system. and so the democrats are those people led at the top by those people who are I would no, I would not say led at the top, I would say the the majority of their supporters who vote and participate is democrats uh, at the top it's it's just Malok, but uh, because they are they're they're shielded from everything, everything's going to be fine for them, they have underwater bunkers, they're going to be fine, they're... everybody have elected by both parties is serving Molic, everybody at the top levels of the media is serving Molic, but there are still people staffing these parties at the at the staff level, at the level of like workers within the political infrastructure, and then of course those people who vote for them most assiduously and who organize for them most, those people, middle class, precarious, without the ability to think uh in class terms and to hope for a challenge to the system that would make it better, would make life better. uh have decided that it's their fault as eyely educated white as white people basically uh that that that white society did this because what liberalism is because it's urban liberalism is is is the middle class trying to convince themselves that it's right and just that they're sitting in a nice appointed room surrounded by misery and that makes you start turning inward and it turns uh it it it's uh, and that means that you end up being overed by your superego, you end up being, you end up sublimating all of your labinal energy into denial and punishment of theself, it's just puritanism, and that is urban, that is urban american liberalism, now suburban, whatever, the democratic party in general, and the way you do that as a liberal is by finding somebody else to blame who is like you, but isn't you? yes, white people, but uh, if i'm a white woman, white men? yes, white people, including white women, but straightt ones, some way that it isn't me, or even if yes i am all those boxes, but i'm aware of it, and all of those things excude exempt you from punishment, but that means somebody else has to pay, and so liberalism is not. making some type of uh understanding of republicans, however you want to find that, pay, be the first through the shoot, it's two for, it's two guys falling into a fucking uh uh meat grinder and they're fighting to see who can push the other one in first so that they can watch them go through, and then yes, they get destroyed too, but at that point when you've given up hope for anything better, that's the only pleasure you can imagine. That's the only future that you can find Solis in, is one where you're watching your enemy suffer. Now the Republicans, they haven't sublimated shit, they're they're out there loud and proud, because they their political formations, their uh, their traditions, their definitions of the terms we use to even think and reason our way through the world, we're forged in the more brutal. and i will destroy the other and i will see the other destroyed before me, and so those are the two strains of assadism at the heart of American politics. uh oh also in this chapter uh uh James does a little uh mind blowing for people who might have always uh uh nurse the idea, hey uh, you know, maybe if the British had not uh, had not been kicked out and we'd stayed a colonies, uh, they would have gotten rid of slavery earlier, and we wouldn't had a civil war, because it's true that around the turn of the 19th century, the British Empire uh, started agitating significantly, internally to abolish the slave trade, which it eventually did in the 1830s, uh, and then let and then... began to patrol the Atlantic Ocean to suppress the slave trade uh after being the biggest slave traders and that's a story that is sometimes told in heroic terms you know uh like the abolionists of America uh William Wilberforce and all that well according to James as soon as the uh north American colonies were uh lost uh it became in England's long-term best economic interest. uh and geostrategic interest to end slavery uh, because they had enough uh slaves, they could certainly ban the slave trade, because they had enough uh blacks in the colonies that they controlled already, meanwhile uh santomeng, which was hugely profitable, the most profitable colony in the Americas, but because it was so brutally exploitative, and it required so much slave labor being imported because so many slaves died, it was really, it would the fact, the fact that it was the most uh, gruesomely uh, physically degrading and dangerous slave colony is has an intimate relationship to why it was the most profitable, and so old wiley, William Pitt. over there in England figures out, hey, we can uh, burnish our credentials here uh, and also enforce a slave trade ban in the Atlantic that would allow us to cut off uh access to slaves to uh the most profitable French colony and make it more vulnerable to us in our game with the frogs, so once... and James coming back to material interests uh and and how how you can see through the bones of social nicity so much more clearly in a place like Haiti and and around uh slavery specifically where you see every consideration social consideration dissolve before the exgency of maintaining slavery so having set up the the the main social groupings within uh within Haiti on the eve of the revolution uh James's third chapter is about how the colony responded to the French revolution which is what really tips everything in out of balance you'd had a miserable grinding relatively stable status quo in Haiti for hundreds of years at that point uh the the the reality the... of life as a as a slave in Haiti was such that even though it was insanely miserably uh uh brutally uh miserable I mean one of the worst places to be a human uh it was the the way of uh the very nature of the regime was such that resistance to it was sort of high just drained of the population uh people just literally have the energy, they were kept uh at a state of pretty much perpetual exhaustion to the point of death uh and that allowed for this uh thing to stay kind of stable, but then news comes from Paris, the king has called the general assemb, the states general, what are we going to do, and uh it leads to a big explosion of uh political ferment on the island, the big white. immediately uh attempt to use the moment to secure independence for the colony uh buse like all of big for their britches colonists they were sick of the mercantile system that forbid them from getting materials from outside of France or selling outside of the french networks uh and imagine that well with the king's authority now uh compromised fuck it uh wel will uh we'll just be our own dudes, we'll rock, and then, but then the small whites uh, joined along uh, because the threat of the uh national assembly in Paris in this new revolutionary government to perhaps uh mess with the racial arrangement and one of the big things that destabilized uh Haitian politics during this period was the uh the loosening of uh restrictions on blacks the the the uh or not blacks I'm sorry uh colores colored uh uh, as they were known, um, Haitians, uh, um, increasing their access to civil rights and allowing uh, even uh, the handful of uh, coloreds who were uh, the product of two parents were both free, uh, went at the time of birth, uh, vote, and the white and the small and white uh, the small and big whites who in France are killing each other or rather the the big the big whites are in the process of of being uh of finally being you know held to account by uh by the small whites of like the urban uh artisan classes the san kulat but they were on the same page in Haiti because uh they were equally committed to the maintenance of the color line uh meanwhile the uh the colored population uh is trying to use the revolution to assert a universality of of rights among property owners and of course not among any slave which is what renders this whole pro uh this whole moment so kind of once again grimly absurd there is It's really brutally, grimly absurd about about the Haitian revolution, and it's because of the absurdity of trying to run a civilized country, with pretentions to ideas of rights and obligations and laws, on top of just a giant machine of human misery, right there, not, not somewhere else, not baffled through chambers of law and language and geography, right in your... fucking face, you have these people uh, you know uh, fighting for their civil rights, their their universally recognized uh human rights to be equal to the other slave owners, to be able to vote together with the other slave owners on what to do about the slaves. and all for a sweet sweet delicious treat that you put in your tea or coffee, something that rotted the teeth out of your gums uh, kept you up late, and that's it, that's all did, it wasn't necessary. It wasn't it wasn't a needed element of the uh European diet. So at the end of the third chapter uh an assembly has been called to replace an assembly that had broken up during this tumultuous battle uh where all the while the uh colonial authorities were the other group of white people i didn't mention earlier, the... actual uh military leaders and and the the governor and the intendant and all that uh and the bureaucrats, this thin sheen of of of legality on top of this whole process, they were unable to uh control events, there weren't enough of them, there weren't enough troops there or enough bureaucrats, and they were there was an attempt by uh the colonial authorities to uh allie with the colors uh to uh check the uh rebellious uh coalition of the big and small whites and it was in the as this uh battle was uh heating up and as uh the uh color population started making moves towards insurrection, one had already happened uh and been brutally repressed, the one by OJ, uh, as this was happening out of nowhere, some the people that these people have been... talking in front of and mobilizing in front of the whole time and just with not even thinking about what they might be seeing what they might be thinking because of the screen of dehumanization. that they had to put up to keep themselves where they were, that very thing that allowed that line that allowed them to gain all that power, to gain all that luxury and all those beautiful homes and fine silks became the very thing that meant that it would be all go up in a fucking blaze of fire in a fucking inferno as their plantations were burned as they were hacked to death with meettes because in the middle of all this strikes a strikes the the first mass uprising of the Haetian Revolution and uh fourth chapter will no doubt uh uh set the scene for that whole thing and step us through it uh so yeah three three next three chapters for uh Tuesday Tuesday. but i i would say that that that the sugar uh industry is a good illustration of just how the colonial project provided the necessary uh raw materials uh trade establishment of trade networks uh and all most of and and importantly um uh surplus uh production of uh of luxury food stuffs helped capitalism in Europe not collapse. on itself, because capitalism is wildly destabilizing and it creates social uh, it creates massive social dislocation as it occurs, it is, it is, it bores everything into oblivion, and that means that it creates unstable political situations, and it creates conflicts within societies and between societies as the resources are ground into the maw and as people are pulled away from their uh their established connections to the world around them and people around them and turn. into individuals and they resist, everybody resists, the old ruling class resists because they were they didn't really sign up for this when they unleash these forces, but and now they're going to try to fight, and then of course the peasants resist because they don't want to be made into whatever the hell this thing is has in mind for them, which they can't even imagine, and what gets them off of their fucking tractors and what gets them into the cities and what soods the b and soos the anxious minds of the aristocrats and the landowners, sweet sugar, sweet delicious sugar, gigs, gimcracks, stuff that is all the product of a uh trade of uh raw resources processed by uh slave labor on excorporated land. and honestly I would say that that's the one thing that marks under emphasizes and I think that under emphasis is the biggest explanation for why he uh wasn't wrong Marx wasn't wrong about anything why he underestimated the timeline the time scales that he was operating off of and that was because not only did colonization jumpstart capitalism in the... like a stabilizing as this thing was rocketing through European societies, and then the crucial moment came in the early 20th century when capitalism's headquarters moved from Europe to North America, and in that case and once that happens the inherent. in European capitalism can kind of blow itself up without destroying the whole system and then can be rebuilt creative destruction baby we love it don't we that's world war two world war one and two the second 30 years war that's i like to think of it as Yes, the cold war was world war 3, that is correct, and we lost, I mean we won, but we won then, but we are gonna lose eventually. I might do a book on the 30 years war after this if I find a good one. I don't know, maybe wedgewood again, there's this like thousand page behem that I've always wanted to read and never got around to it though, anyone has another one uh, me now yeah, world war 4 is not climate change annihilating us all, it's uh technology plus it's human uh, technology plus it's human trader minions uh destroying the rest of us. the climate change is just the context of them liquidating us uh as needed and when i say us, i mean all humans, i don't mean us as an Americans, not right away, we will be the last to feel the blade, but what will make the blade send faster is how much we're going to be fixated on making sure that our enemies pay hit the take the blade first, that is what's going to, if anything does, crack it all up is is our politically invested populist being so committed to uh seeing somebody else suffer before them uh that if things get distabled to stabilized uh they're going to want they're going to reach for the acts of destruction not for solidarity. Yeah, I mean, we're they're going, they're at war with us right now, and of course for right now, we are also the ones that are on war on behalf of, because right now they're fighting war on behalf of the American standard of living, basically, because the American standard of living is what powers the world economy, it is the thing, it's the reason we have stuff, is the... American standard of living, and economic development is extending the American standard of living as far to the world as possible. now of course, that's impossible, you get to a point where you start having enough people living the American standard of living, and the uh fucking biome starts to collapse, which is what we're in, and so everybody. 'who enjoys an American standard of living anywhere in the world is uh on one side of a war with the rest of us, and a lot of us are really struggling with the implications of that, how do I live knowing that I am on the wrong side, not because I do, I use plastic straws, not because of any specific actions I do, but just because uh where i am situated in the global chain of supply chain, you can't not be uh in there, because it's not you standing it up, it's the uh, it's the structures that you are emeshed in that stand it up, your individual participation is beside the point, and i think that is one reason people like to think of climate apocalypse in in very... uh mid-century, mid- mid-20th century terms, they want to think of it as another uh Dr. Strange Love ending because they love the idea of uh of you know extinguishment rather that they certainly find more pleasurable to imagine about apocalyptic extinguishment than they do of just slowly over time becoming more innerd to the misery dished out on our behalf and more uh in need of a uh shape, a mental justification for why, what i why i'm not trying to do something more, why i'm not risking anything to stop this, i'm not blaming anybody for that. I can see why why you want to think everyone wants to think that it'll just one day that you're always going to be you can imagine yourself the victim of this thing. All right folks, talk to you soon.
