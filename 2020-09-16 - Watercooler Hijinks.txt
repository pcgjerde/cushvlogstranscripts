 Tell me when you hit tweet. We are building a religion, we are building it bigger, we are widening the corridors and adding more lanes, we are building a religion, a limited edition, we are now accepting callers for these pendant key chains, to resist it is useless, it is useless to resist it, his cigarette is burning, but he never seems to ash, he is grooming his poodle. he is living comfort eagle, you can meet at his location, but you'd better come with cash, now his hat is on backwards, he can show you his tattoos, he is in the music business, he is calling you dude, now today is tomorrow, and tomorrow today, and yesterday is weaving in and out, welcome to kush vlog, strap yourself in because you are now entering the rent zone with your host. It's Matt Chrisman, oh hi, I didn't see you there, we're back in the office, we're uh beta testing a new setup, of course, and I think we're all going to be very happy with it when it all comes together, it's going to be fantastic, but for now I'm just going to talk for a bit, nobody has to get mad, that it's different, it'll be the same for anyway, I'm going to be talking directly to you as I always do from. far distance, but presumably with better fucking uh audio, because Chris is here and he's master audio file, that's the only type of file he is by the way, don't start any rumors, um, today I wanted to start talking, I want to get off on a ran here as Dennis Miller would say, because a piece of media was produced today that was basically designed to annoy me and designed to get a rise out of me, and it did to a small extent, to the extent that it provided me some Gris. for this mill uh and that's of course the Atlantic article about Sean Mckelway about how and uh how he's trying to get the left to uh grow up and stop uh stop doing owns and start getting some real progressive policy passed by hitching their wagon to the winning team known as the Democratic party uh and of course a lot of people got really mad at it as well they should every article about him is infuriating every quote by him is designed to make your fucking skin crawl he is just the worst. sort of clearly vacant eyeed amoral grasping climber who sees an opportunity to weazele himself into a sinicure uh who has never believed in anything uh and now wants to use his ability to mouth the language of of like the burjoning online left whatever the hell that is to uh to secure for himself really more than anything. position uh in the democratic uh patrious network, he is a lot like sort of a left, a liberal Charlie Kirk, because he's offering basically the same thing to the establishment of his party that he prefers. Charlie Kirk's pitch to the nation's ranced grandparents is, I will prevent your uh grandkid from turning gay or getting purple hair uh when they go to college by doing epic mememes at them. Uh, Mckelway's pleed to uh pitch to the... democratic establishment is, i promise that i will get these uh these damn internet uh troll kids to uh get with the program and uh stop posting pig-poot balls at camala harris but instead vote for her uh and in both cases actually accomplishing that goal is meaningless it's secondary the only real goal is getting the gig and keeping it and things like this pieces of PR like this are part of that so that's the main reason the article exists is is self promotion for him and maintaining his position in this party structure uh, but there is a deeper emptiness to it that I think is very uh, is very resonant for me anyway, and it's that article, which I didn't read all of, I just read some exerts, that article is not pitched towards, disaffected online millennial left, whatever the hell, it's pitched towards, I mean it's it's in the Atlantic, it's for Atlantic readers, it's people who already have made the same. uh compromises to themselves that channelwie has have made the same decision to to just go along to get along and to be absorbed into the democratic borg uh because it's bath at least existence and it's the one that allows them to materially benefit the most, and so all the stuff about, hey, listen to me, I know how to win, which you know as the guy who backed Warren is pretty hilarious, because whatever you want to say about anybody in 2016, nobody had a a a a less firm grasp on the electorate than fucking Warren did as as exhibited by her actual performance in the race uh, but he's still around because there is still a need to have people who speak the language of you know... of radicalism, whatever that means and it's largely been, it's it's had meaning part of drained out of it, uh, but on behalf of the establishment, so that article is only for other people who already agree with mckelway, and so he's doing it for self-promotion, but what are they reading it for, what are they getting out of it, and and and what is he getting out of like this self-justification besides self-promotion? uh, and I think a lot part of it is just that old Job quote, the wicked flee when none pursued from the... where these people won, you know, like Shan Michell, obviously picking war wasn't a victory, but considering that he wasn't actually interested in doing anything other than getting himself a job and keeping himself uh like with his tick-like uh position uh within the democratic establishment, it doesn't matter if Warren one or not, he is now selling Biden to to the young people and that and that means that he's got a job, so so he won because he didn't really care what happened unless other than him succeeding. uh we lost because we were actually trying to you know break the power that is behind the democratic party and that might have been a fool's errand, but i i it it felt like it was worth trying at the time, that's for sure uh, but they won and he won and so what is this, like what what are why are you insisting this shit about oh you got to grow up and stop being mean to me? the the only the only enemies that he talks about in the peace that i saw uh the only people pushing back against his argument are un' named trolls, a guy with a Homer Simpson avatar, who calls him a sellout, which is hilarious cuz he had nothing to sell out, he's a hollow eyed fucking uh con artist, i mean the guy went to denish desus's fake evangelical diploma mill in the empire state building and then got a heritage foundation fucking uh uh internship out of it, he just he went to where he thought that there was more opportunity because as as a as a refrigerator wide white guy uh the sort of there's a lot of those guys over at the uh uh at the troughh in the republican party that you could like better leverage his brand on the left uh, but these people know that there's nothing to any of this, they know that this is completely empty, and so they're just going to keep yelling at a phantom, at this phantom opponent, the guy in the Homer Simpson avatar forever, because it's banko's ghost at the feast, it's... It's the it's the remnant of whatever sliver of of of a sense of virtue or or political purpose or idealism you ever had echoing in your ears and nothing will blot it out except for continually reasserting your own virtue and rightness and wisdom because look at me i i have my own polling operation where i ask people who's the most intersectional m&m and they have to they have to keep b that gong just to drown out the sound of their own dying conscience uh, but there is one other element to it, there's one other thing that goes into it, I think, and it is, and this is where it actually is pitched to the people it's supposed to, who obviously are not going to read it and agree with it, they going to read it and get mad about it, or not even read it and just post and own about it, it's to maintain the facade that there still is an argument to be had within the Democratic Party, that there still is a live conflict, and that you should redouble. your efforts along those lines uh and it it masks the the greater truth which is that the war at that point right now for the Democratic Party is over and and and uh and so effort along those lines at at the level of like presidential election electoral politics is basically pointless like this election, the presidential election is one in which there is no left-wing agency, there is no agenda, there is no leverage. point uh and I think a lot of people have decided one way or another that one of the ways they're going to cope with the powerlessness they feel is by convincing themselves that there is some way to vote in this election that will own somebody that they don't like, like we're not going to get anything other than choking on more uh forest uh fire smoke and and boiling in more seawater and and more austerity realistically in the short term that's all we're going to get and that's certainly all we're going to get no matter wh gets elected in this in November, but there's someone who can get owned, and so you've got people who have decided that not voting is going to be their way to own the Democrats. or voting for Trump is going to own the democrats, and the fact is is that since there's no coordination here and every vote is an individual act of of alienation one way or the other, that there can be no ownage, we are all owned, we're own now, we've been owned, we will be owned in the future, that might change, but what's going to change it is not going to have anything to do with the individual choice of an individual person to vote any way in this election, I think that a lot of people regardless of their of their uh ideology are horrified by that, because buse then what, and uh, I don't know, but I do know that the beginning, the the first thing is sitting with that for a wall, sit with the impodence, sit with the inability to exercise influence over this process and then think forward, instead of creating more and more broke fantasies whereby your specific vote will turn the tide and own someone. because you can say, imagine if Trump got reelected, wouldn't that own the libs? yeah, they'd be pretty fucking owned, i mean in the sense that they would feel uh, they'd get very mad and they would they would, but they would just, it wouldn't change anything, and more importantly, your choice to vote for Trump, even in a swim state as one person, because remember, this is all about one person, all these we we get this fantasy when people talk about voting that because it's like being transmitted to an audience, a broad audience that then hypothetically that that that that that transfers into a... a meaningful block, no, it's individual people, individually consuming media and then making an individual choice to vote based off of that and other things, which is uncoordinated, which is uh, which has no of the none of the power of like a class based self-conscious project, and as such cannot own anyone, all you can do is own yourself, which is all we're doing, we're all owning ourselves while thinking we owning other people, and that's the the promise that we have been given in the political sphere is nothing's going to get better, but you can own, you can own people you hate, and the thing is, you can believe you are, but you're not, you really aren't, we're that spite is even the spite is a lusory, everyone's getting owned by the conditions that continue to deteriorate, and our inability to articulate any opposition to them, uh, our individual decision to vote, and then what, like tweet our ballot at someone? uh is just pissing in the wind in terms of ownage. i would like to uh say also that i found some cool uh cards here in the golf war trading set we have that i hadn't seen before. my one of my favorite ones is this one, it's it's from the intelligence file part and it says chemical biological warfare, which if you had to pick any card out of this deck that i've gone through so far and we've opened about six. six decks, so there's like 60 cards out here, this is this is the like when you're playing taro this is the death card or whatever, you know, this is the one that signals a change in the tone, because this is the one that will be, this is the card that that George W. played to get us back into the war, i mean they use the term wmd to create this fantasy of you, a nuclear threat from Iraq, which was never real and never even close to being real, the... the only things they had that were beyond conjecture or outright lies like the the aluminum tubes and the uh Nigerian yellow cake was Saddam's old chemical and biological weapons programs which were real and which were destroyed mostly uh after the Persian Gulf War, but they were those those uh the evidence for those was resurrected, added to the shit about the fake nuclear threat and turned into WMD, so this is the card that starts, this is... if if if George W. Bush getting us to Iraq is like a is is a uh game of Pokemon uh this is the card he throws down to begin the match, but listen to the what it says on the back of this card, but which was published in 1991. Chemical and biological weapons are frightening, but overrated threats to military personnel. Many factors including wind, humidity and temperature have a large impact on the effectiveness of these weapons. The training and equipment of today's fighting forces further reduced the thread of chemical and biological agents. National policy. it's like they're like, don't worry about them, yeah, yeah, they got some mustard gas, but it's mustard gas, then in 2002, mustard gas is no, they're going to put it on a fucking uh, on a cesna and and go over central park during uh, during uh, a Paul mccartney concert and kill everybody, the other one i like here though is uh, from that military skill, moon fases, which i was really hoping would be about the way that they harness, the power of uh of astrology to determine uh our military tactics, but no, apparently it's because moon phases factor heavily in the military. for operation desert storm, coalition forces had a decided advantage in darkness because of their night vision equipment, which I mean they were fight, they were fighting a blind opponent, congratulations, way, way to kick their ass, to capitalized further on this asset, both the air war and the ground war began during times of little moonlight, the phases of the moon from new moon to full moon are caused by the special relationship of the sun, the earth and the moon, I really love it when they give you the little extra. info there at the end, and then another one of my favorites, military asset, bombs, just bombs. bombs are usually categorized as being one of three major types: general purpose bombs typically weigh from 500 to 200 pounds and can penetrate up to 11 feet of concrete. guided bomb units glide towards their targets using laser infrared or electro-optical guidance systems. cluster bomb units are loaded with many small. submunitions that disperse over great distances, exploding immediately or lying dormant as mines. by the way, cluster bombs are a war crime and there's been many attempts to ban them internationally from use and uh uh in warfare uh and we stop it all the time because it's a key component of our military doctrine is no no we need to have the capacity to just drop a big canister over a neighborhood and have a tiny a bunch of tiny plastic brightly colored little widgets just flutter to ground so that anybody can pick one up and blow up, it's key, if we don't have that, if we don't do that, the fucking irakis will be uh crossing the potomic and dinges, we have to do it, we got any questions over there, chris, uh, let's see, good yet, hello everybody, um, I will say that your mention of intersect, which m&m is intersectional, uh, I enjoyed that it spawn. good five minutes of debate among that within the uh within the chat. all right, i'm interested to know what they came down on. uh, there are a lot of different opinions, i wasn't tracking all of them, but i was uh enjoying the conversation there. um, but yeah, if you want to throw some questions in here uh, we can we can, i'll read them out. i mean, is it the lady m&m or is she not intersectional? because well, there are two lady m&m's right? are there? i think the green and the green one is the lady, but i thought she was the only one. um, this is a good question just because... i would notice or a good comment just because i noticed you singing it the other day, which is the best titus andronicas album uh local business, one of the best openings tracks from any album ever. yeah, i got to go local business. uh, etchi echi homo, yeah, love echi homo. um, a little on this, i see somebody maybe because this might also send you off on a rant. i saw somebody posting this several times, did you see the spug turtletech tick turtleneck wearing tik tok lady yelling about voting today? i did see i mean she's been on there for a while, i really enjoy that because it i couldn't even watch the whole thing and... the bit is that she's like yelling at a child right, she's like a fictional child basically, well can we play it? cuz i never actually, i never actually watched it, uh, i could play it for the chat, but i don't think you could hear it, all right, i'm going to put it on my computer, all right, let's see if i can my hand computer as it's called, because i actually like the thing is these kind of things i actually avoid watching because they're upsetting and i don't like them, uh, and her face is very upset. to me and i don't like it so her voice sounded very unpleasant and i didn't like that either so let me see if i can find it uh i don't want to go searching on twitter uh that much but if you uh if you can if somebody can dm me the link to it uh i could probably play it off off this pretty quickly oh here it is i found her oh great and it feels like voting for republican. going to do it, you want to know why? because the alternative is a fucking fascist a fascist is a fascist, maybe we can have the conversation about a fascist is running, maybe we can do that later, maybe we can talk about it later, awesome, that's like i thought it was, she was yelling at them like their children, and the thing that really hit me about that is, "i don't have children, but isn't it universally understood that when you say that to your kids, like, hey, you know what, uh, maybe, we'll see, maybe later, that you're just, you're just stringiing them along, and you don't actually ever plan on doing the thing, you just want them to shut up long enough to like get out of the arbies or something, yes, like that's, that's why you say that to your kids, right, you say, hey, maybe later we'll talk about it, like it's, so she's already like embedded in it, contempt for even the objection, in like, I am pretending that I'm taking this seriously, but I'm actually not taking it seriously, and I think that it is, it is the demand of a child, it's the demand of demand of a child to go to McDonald's. instead of go eating the food we have at home uh which you know you can think that but it it seems pretty short sited cuz if you really think that things would be any different really if we had a republic democrat and power you don't you don't think the west coast would be on fire you don't think we'd have coronavirus everywhere then i really don't know what to tell you it's like fine you're living in a fantasy world but we don't have to the thing the main thing is this is where the grill pilling come is is that the beauty part of like understanding how limited your power over this situation is is that you don't have to get as crazy as she is, you don't have to get as insane as she is screaming about fascism, as if we really had a fascist in power, you could vote against him, like if Trump was run, like a fascist is president in this cosmology, and yet we're also having an election whose outcome is in doubt that we could potentially win against fascism, how is that what has fascism ever been uh everceded to being removed from? so it's like you don't have to take this shit seriously, she's convincing herself, and that's the main thing about liberals, and that's why they're panicking, and this is all all this shit is panic because they think Biden might lose, they think they backed the the strong steady horse, oh no, he had demential the whole time, could have told you, is that they they can only talk to each other, they can only speak in the language that has convinced them of where they are, and that's is the language of of duty, that's the language of you have to vote, because voting is a personal, moral act of virtue, that's the liberal conception of it, and so you are morally obligated to vote against the fascists, but if you don't accept that premise, or even if you do, but you it leads you to another uh conclusion, they cannot speak, all they could do is what she did, scream at people like their children, turn into a... Karen, because there is no uh, that they can't even get out of their own head that much, because because to get out of that headspace would require questioning foundational like structures of their uh of their mental architecture that cannot be questioned, that that are load bearing, and and if because if voting isn't a moral virtuous, you know, personal sacred act that that like codifies your... uh political identity and your personal virtue, then what the hell is it, and what the hell are you doing, and those are questions they have no answer for, so they can't even speak beyond their own bubble, all they can do is yell, and then I think the proper response is to be like, okay, that's that's nice, you clearly are having a tough day, uh, I hope you have a better one, and then just paying it no mind, uh, the the the invocation of fascists also. as some kind of like magic word or spell that like buse i've seen other like more liberal friends of mine do this is like as it's as if it's a trump card or as we were talking about earlier in yu-go games a trap card uh that like by by labeling something fascious it's you know it's that that classic internet rule that you can't you know once you call something Hitler there's nothing further that you can go if you just make it clear that he is the magic word fascist then there's no argument against it uh and I think it's it's it's often. deployed in this this kind of um panicked way that you're talking about you know yeah no that's all they have is they can just they just press the button and and go crazy with it which is why i think on the left people should be careful of the fascism it's a same like i it's amazing like a lot of people understood instinctively that even if like there's a kernel of truth to rushea gate like the colonel of truth being that donald trump was making most of his money by the end of his uh time before running for president as a front man for money laundering from like Russian oligarchs and mob figures, through Deutsche Bank, like that's pretty clear, and so that there is a question of you know of corrupt compromise there, uh, which is a real thing, but considering the context and the way that it was used, there's no use talking about it, it was a non-starter and it was not something to be engaged with, but a lot of those people are, they think, yes, but this fascism stuff, this is different, this is real, and I think it's because it gets a more basal like emotive uh, point, and it gets them, it gets them riled up, which people. want out of politics, because it is mostly a spectacle for everybody, even people on the left, but these are the people who are really grabbing that with both hands, the fascist notion, because it it more than anything right now drowns out any other considerations but getting him out of office, which you know it doesn't matter either way from an individual perspective, but if that's what you're focusing on, it clouds your ability to to direct your own actions, and it makes you a hostage to people like this. with her awful glasses and stupid turtle neck yelling at you, well you know i was thinking about this lately that you know in in by the is that berto echo who has the like the definition yes or fascism i was thinking about that? in regards to uh you know the very clownish way that Trump talks about antifa is both these these like brusers who are going to break into your house and literally murder you, but also these weak of feet little arms, little cigarette arms, i could that i could smoke your arms dude, um and how how classic that is that the enemy both has to be overwhelming and uh you know completely beatable, but in its own smug way, the the fastest thing around the... the the liberal revoltion to Trump is kind of similar because he both has to be the most dangerous person who has ever occupied in in American history the most dangerous figure in American history who is also a ridiculous clown who is not to be taken seriously yeah you could vote out of office and he has to leave um yeah and i i don't know i'm not saying that there there's a kind of liberal fascism there i'm not you know uh the dead kennedy's talking about jerry brown but i don't know it's interesting that it goes both is that that both sides have to see, well i mean the thing is is it's it's it's in both cases it is in fascism it's more it's endemic because fascism is essentially irrational and it's appeal to people in in it in its electoral like and it's in it's mass appeal it is it is like a it is organized irrationality uh but with liberals too like there's an irrationality to the heart because there is buse these people love facts they love being scientific they fucking love science they love the... impirical observation, they're not mystics like like the fascists are, but they live in a world that does not comport in any way to what it should according to their analytical framework, so they still have to create fantasies, they still have to create this unreason at the center of their political thinking, and that means you have to have this constantly shifting enemy who is both overwhelmingly terrifying, but beatable, because if they are, if they're one and not the other, then they cannot be the focal point of your... anxiety and your political energies, they have to be both, but realistically no things are, you know uh, because these are just like these are antifa, which is just a bunch of people, they are, it's not even an organization, it's just a bunch of people acting independently for the most part, and he is just a a figure head for you, this cabal of of of of like multi-level marketing crooks and ponzi schemers and and like uh supplement salesman who are like looting the government uh neither of them are actually responsible for any of the real horror that we're trying to deal with right now, but what is cannot be conceived of, cannot be seen through the lacuna at the center of the site of either the liberal or the fascist or the protofascist or whatever you want to call them? uh, thank you those in chat who got my hundred gecks joke, um, you're what, uh, i made a hundred gecks joke a while back, what is that? uh, they're banned, uh, they have a song that refers to people being little piss babies with arms are like cigarettes, um, by the way, was complaining, he was making fun of the antif guys for their thin arms, the man there no one in human has history is at less like muscle tone than this person. i believe it was David Roth, said that after one of his, he tweeted after one of his uh physicals, he's like the doctor says i've never seen anything like it before, he he's he's all he's made entirely morang, the boy is all egg, i still cont that Trump has well-developed calf muscles from supporting 100% of his way leaning have definition the calves have definition because he does have to do the smooth criminal thing every time he's standing in front of a crowd yes but his arms they've got to just be he's got to have the windshield wiper of like flab right like just the wattlely wet cray papery skind thing wafting fucking like puffs of baby powder rising from it. every time that slaps against his body, um, i bet the insides of his suits are entirely from, oh god, just powdered, just powdered, just like you, the picture of him coming back from uh, oklahoma with the fucking makeup on the neck, oh yeah, like just the inside of the jack, the inside of the shirts and jacket are just white with baby powder, um, folks, i don't have any way to play music out loud here, next time we do one of these, i'll bring a portable speaker so i can irritate Matt with music, i also saw somebody else, i love being irritated. music, that sounds good, i i want to after you guys were talking about music videos and the the top of the last episode, i want to have you guys on one of me and molly's music video streams, we'll just watch November rain and stuff, i would love that, but uh, i know you were talking about Travis Scott, your last few things, one thing that i do legitimately would love to show Matt on a stream and i think people would get a lot out of is i would love to show you the travis Scott documentary uh because it is one of the most insane things about over fan enthusiasm, like these people are literally ripping themselves apart at uh travis travis. shows, it's it's like a um, you know, it's like a it looks like a fucking white knight uh or something uh, the moshing is out of control, and then you listen to travis Scott song and it's like, i just will go kind of late. "I don't know what I'm going to do today, it's like, it's it's bizarre and I think that you would get a get a kick out of it, his name is Jock, yeah, it's a cool name, right, Travis is not a cool name, and apologies to Travis's maybe in the chat, but I'm sorry, I only knew one Travis in elementary school, and he uh, he was one of those like grubby ginger kids, the ones that just kind of seemed dirty all the time, and he literally did eat out of the garbage can." That's Travis in my mind to be clear, I would you pick that name? Uh, I do like Travis Scott and Sicco mode is a true banger, especially the scrillix remix of a sico mode, that song wips, is he the only guy, you can tell me this as a non-boomer, is he the only hip-hopist rapper with just a guy's name as his rap name, or is that a new common thing? no, there there are other guys like that, I'm not going to be able to think of one off the top of my head, but certainly a lot of guys go just with with their uh real name now, but that's not his real name is. like that would be one thing, if they wanted the real name, that'd be one thing, yeah, is he the only guy who's got a real guy's name that isn't his as his rap name? uh, there are a lot of suggestions in here, uh, it depends, do you consider Frank ocean a real name? that's not his real name, i i don't know, i don't believe so. i think we're going to get in a little weeds in this uh, jones, somebody suggesting, danny brown, i don't know if these are these guys real names, uh, anyway, all i know is i don't understand these kids today, uh, let's unless there are any um Virgil Texas, yes, that is real name. Um, any other like actual questions other than just names of recording artists uh in the chat. Otherwise, I would kind of let it want to talk about the thing that we um, that we uh uh, that we were talking about right before we started, which is the the the what it means, what's suburbs mean now? Yeah, yeah, buse we were talking a little bit before we started. about how you know we were just talking about the the Trump Antifa stuff and how it's pitched at this suburban panic um over you know like poor people moving into the suburbs but the suburbs are already depopulated in that way there uh I mean the inner ring suburbs are now where poverty uh is is moving into and it's not because of uh you know uh deep state bureaucrats moving affordable housing to the... suburbs, it's it's just it's title gravity uh, as as as uh the white children of the suburbs moved into the inner cities of our of our nation's uh you know urban areas, it drove up costs significantly, which meant people who live there had to move, and they move to the uh the inner ring suburbs, which are being emptied out by the movement of younger like uh, cognitive, you know, college educated white... people whatever to the cities, us uh, and then the parents to these uh edge cities, the the the even further like megamansion uh uh suburbs that are even farther away from urban areas, and the inner rig suburbs are now where poverty exists and is as being being replicated uh, and Trump has no idea, and the funny thing is is most of his voters aren't even aware of this, like the real hardcore ones, the ones that are paying attention, because this is all... happening outside of anyone's notice, because because we're still like we're still living with a conception of like the American electorate and the american and the like the geographic and demographic distribution of Americans that is pre 2008 you know yeah like like there was a significant and and sharp and massive collapse that happened uh around housing that has never really... been that changed the face of America in a way that is only deepening with time but has not been reckoned with in any real way because neither party wants to act like it happened yeah we were talking about it also in the fact that like how much of politics is basically based around protecting people's like property values yeah and that's like again where the antifat thing comes from or just like how people respond to like taxes and like wealth management through visa v the state but the funny thing is as people collect themselves in these giant expensive houses that they bought for cheap, and now there' been all these slew of articles about how nobody can actually buy them from them, if nobody can buy your property then your property value is zero dude. yeah, seriously, like these people have totally fixated their politics around protecting their property values at all costs, and what that has ended up doing is contributing to a political economy where no young people have any fucking money and they're all still convinced that it's because the... spending too much money frivously on you know like uh chocolate multeds at the soda shop or whatever or minx stoles to wear to the college football game where you wave a penent that says college on it and drive around in a fucking stand steamer or ride on a bicycle built for four with two of your fourth form chums and uh and cablenet sweaters and and a young sweetie, but in reality uh no, there's no money to be had, everyone is sattled with wild amounts of debt if they went to college, if they avoided college, the job they have likely or the jobs they have more likely uh are not even ever going to come close to providing them with the savings that they could take to even think of uh putting down as down payment and and they're just sitting, these old people are sitting on this housing stock just being like, yep, I'm going to sell this one day and move to a cute little condo and just spend my retirement uh zipping around on my fucking ski dots like you're all in for a massively rude awakening and and it's one that there's no force in American politics that has any ability to uh confront all right this goes this is from a second ago but this goes back to the the previous conversation um uh uh what do liberals even think fascism is and how should we conceive of it differently uh well liberals think of fascism because you know liberalism is now about manners and about affect because it cannot be about material conditions because it's insufficient to the moment and if it ever actually has to confront the moment it will be aware of that insufficiency so it has to maintain this this aesthetic fixation uh, it's it's all the bad stuff that the United States does as a matter of course, but when republicans do it, and specifically now when Trump does it, because he does it in a way that offends their aesthetic sensibilities uh, and I think that like I give credit a lot of the people on the left to focus on fascism, they they don't think of it so much in terms of Trump, they think of it in terms of you, insurgent, of like police violence, uh, authoritarianism uh rising right-wing you know uh mobilization uh among paramilitaries or whatever uh but i think for whatever truth there is to that it it obscures the greater truth that that the political sphere doesn't exist to to necessitate or uh or encourage and acculturate a fascist political culture uh what we getting we're getting what we're getting instead is a depoliticized space where politics is pure spectacle, where politics is not like wrestled over in the streets, it is uh the battle is simulated, simulated everywhere, simulated online, even simulated by people shooting each other in the streets, because even there there is nothing like the sort of mobilized organized violence you saw in Inter War Germany for example between the red front fighters and and the stormtoopers it is, it's atomized political violence, and that's because it's an atomized political culture, and that violence might intensify, and I think it likely will, uh, but it will not intensify, I don't think to some sort of seasure of power by a broad-based fascist movement, it will most likely just accompany a slow and steady dissolution of the uh concept of politics and the... placement of it with a regime of just naked market coersion that using technology and surveillance to replace political uh political participation or coersion? got any other good cards? i'm looking through. all right, i got a schwarz card. the man himself, i think it does his buse, the guy who presided over the uh, the uh, Lindberg baby case was also named schwarz scoff and I always wonder if they were related. I think they were actually someone can confirm that or not. Yeah buse he was from New Jersey and uh and the the Lindbergs lived in New Jersey so I think he was like the son or grandson of the guy who was in charge of the Lindberg case uh somebody in chat says it was his father it was his dad yeah by the way Schwarzcof fantastic german name blackhead his name means blackhead his name means disgusting thing on your face. after graduating Normans after graduation, I like it just says graduation, it doesn't say from, I guess you'd say West Point, I mean pretty pretty clearly here, after graduation, Norman Schwarzcoff was commissioned second lieunant in the infantry, he commanded, he commanded two combat tours in Vietnam and was designated deputy commander of the joint task force in charge of US forces participating in the Grenada rescue operation, oh that's right, that was a we were rescueing those uh fucking med students, all of whom were shit faced and had no idea what was happening, he served his army. operations deputy for the joint chiefs of staff and deputy chief of staff for operations and plans at the US army's headquarters, the kind of guy could have turned that into a into a political career the way that colin did, but he didn't, he didn't seem to have any interest in it, it's interesting, i wonder if it was just like he was, he was, he tried and failed or if he just does something that didn't that didn't trigger him, uh, he was he was too handsome of a general, i mean he's he's he's kind of he just well the he that was enough for him, sometimes that's enough for people, yes uh, he kind of looks like alex jones honestly, he's got the same kind of round face shape and and red coloring and the same balding pattern too, um, i also want while we're o the top of cards, this is from way back uh in the chat, but i want to uh shout out the person who got the chapos by uh magic the gathering colors right in one shot, matt is indeed green, virgil is blue, felix is red, will is white and amber is black, okay, that is, i can confirm that that is the correct magic the gathering alone, i had a my best friend in high school was a huge magic the gathering fan, he had a giant collection of cards uh, but i could never understand it and it made my head hurt, why am i green? uh, it's the... It's the forest color uh, a lot of large, powerful creatures, it's earthy, spells, stuff like that, okay, I get it, a lot of creatures with trample, which I feel like is an atribute that uh, that Matt would have. Well, I mean, I did the, I did that instagram thing where you find out who directed your movie last night, and the first one I got was miazaki, which I was not too happy with, because I am no anime, strictly no anime, and I know, oh, he's not anime, it's Japanese, it's animation, it's anime, uh, but apparently princius moninoki has a lot of forest creatures in it. Yes, so I could be, I could be one of the, I could, I could be like the forest army from Monoki. I feel like you would vibe with uh Miyazaki, uh, I was, I was watching a mini, mini miazaki uh run, I got to wonder, what is, what is the black, I know I, when you said amber is the black deck, of course, but what is that, it's the color of uh, swamps is is their land, it's like all the like evil uh creatures, you know, like draculas, zombies, stuff like that, she would agree completely. yeah um things like that uh Felix uh red mountains fire uh you know yeah like you like a zorostrian yeah yeah and if any anybody was asking my color i am the artifacts what are those - just like a uh non-colorbase like artificial creatures and items little gadgets and doo hickkies what was the virgil one uh blue island swamps i didn't know we would be getting this this into it i'm interested i'm sorry because it's a thing i watched a lot of but could never get my head around, i could never figure out card-based gaming. um, it's it's it's a bad effect to have, um, if you're going to go with the wizard cost property, uh, go, just go with DND, you only have to buy the books once with magic, you have to continually buy all the cards and it's honestly a huge scam for 13-year-olds. no, all the card base games just just seem to be uh like essentially nicotine for children. yes exactly. cardboard crack, that's what they called it when i was like 12 or whatever. uh all right let's get a let's get a real question oh i saw this i i was watching your um your stream with brind from bpp lettuce the other night which i thought was uh nice and you ended up talking a lot about um orgs value of orgs but it started we love orbs don't we f with the conversation around as she called it being CIA pilled yeah which i know that you've been talking about a little on and and the value the values and limitations of believing everything is an op yes so this person's question was matt has how uh and I would add, or even is it possible, can the left harness the power of conspiracy theory, or is it even worth it to try, i i'm back and forth on this question and my my main sticking point with conspiracy theory is that conspiracy theory is is it's seductive because it provides something that traditional politics is difficult often can't and which like left-wing materialist politics specifically has a very difficult time. with, which is creating narratives, which is creating a simple, almost cinematic narrative of why things are bad in the world, uh, who is responsible, and what it suggests is what is to be done with them, and the thing about the conspiracy mindset that that I think is a problem for the left as as a like potential uh, you um, you know, avenue of of uh, of radicalization, is that the narrative of... the conspiracy ends with revelation and then uh justice right? like there's we have a system and it is not the system that produces bad results, it is people embedded within it, and realistically then, the only way to defeat them would be to have them be named publicly, proven responsible and then punished, and i just i don't think there is any effective way of getting across the reality. of our crisis and and the need and and what is needed to defeat it that can comport with that that narrative inertia of the of the conspiracy mindset which which which ends with? with the bad guys getting revealed, and it really isn't about bad guys, at the end of the day, it's about institutions reproducing themselves, it's about an algorithm, it's about an algorithm of capitalist profit extraction that is now, thanks to technology, almost free of human interference, like like the silicon valley, like they operate off of the they have created a mechanism for imbuing every facet of our lives with conditioning to turn us into profit maximizing nodes without our consent or even knowledge and without the need for anybody to be in a room and plan it out, the algorithm is already written into the code and it then writes over our lives and writes over our institutions and writes over our destinies, and it's only by replacing that code that we're going to have any. chance of uh breaking out of of this you know self-defeating uh uh scramble for for dwindling resources uh but it doesn't involve any grand justice there's no there's not going to be any any uh tribunals for the deep state petoes i mean there might be tribunals there might be people going to jail if you had some sort of revolution but but they will never be the point of it and and replacing them will never be uh sufficient to the justice done, you know, I was thinking about that also kind of recently that that might be, in my mind, maybe one of the things that makes people go most insane is the and see conspiratorialy, is the kind of complete breakdown of consequences, yeah, in the highest level of society, yeah, that's why and on is like, no, this is happening behind closed doors, the the chrissy tegan has already been executed, yeah, I mean, that is, that does seem like the major innovation of Q and on is that the... the prophecy is already being fulfilled, has been fulfilled and you don't, you just can't see it, but you can you can divine it from the entrails, yes, and that's the participation is that justice is being done, and if you want to experience the sense of you know of uh catharsis and security that comes with knowing that justice is done, you merely have to correctly scry through the the... signs uh and and and then you will have catharsis and you will have justice, and that's purely illusor, it's all a fantasy, and any anything based on that that level of of, you know, of of political action will always end up in a culdasac of fantasy. uh, what else? let's see, i'm scrolling back here, uh, like the person who posted who are your bad guys? who are my bad guys? uh, well you now Alan Dullas, the originator, we love him, one of the best uh, Dr. Sydney Gottleib, you know, an absolute king, um, Bill Casey, shout out, uh, Lucio Jelly, we love to see him, uh, let's see. uh and let's let's get some questions in chat, let's get some new topics, uh, one of these cards I have is Arabic language, did you, did you explain the Canadian national anthem one on on, I think I did, yes, which I thought was very fun, very fun, I mean, it just seems that they're they're reaching a little bit, I mean, I guess they've got they clearly they they they they're they got. over uh ambitious with with the deck concept clearly because the war really was just this potetempkin, it was basically a a demo, it was just a it was we just said hey the us is going to have a military demo in the in the middle east to show off our capacity and our unchallenged status as world hegemon now that the Soviets are gone uh you want to watch or you want to participate uh come come and check it out. uh and they had to make this huge deck of cards over what inevitably what would boil down to a PR exercise so uh they're going to have to scramble a lot, that's why they have a card for Canadian government uh and Canadian national anthem, i also think they have one for the mounties in here too, i got uh how many mounties were deployed in golf, how many mounties were deployed i would like to know. um, I somebody has been posting a lot about uh reading before the storm on your uh... recommendation? oh yeah, the first pearl steam book. uh, wondered if there's any uh thoughts on before the storm? uh, it's it's really interesting, it's it's it's the one that has the least uh, like personality hook because goldwater is such a boring guy, like regan was boring, but his vacuity was kind of interesting because he was such an empty vessel, goldwater was very uncomplicated, he was just he was a fucking him, he was a... basically he was a he he inherited a department store from his family in Arizona and he was like yeah this is great why can't everyone just uh chill out and have a uh have a family owned business and stop bothering me about it uh and he got dragged into the president he was essentially drafted in 64 by the like the activist right wing of the party he did not really seek the nomination which is very rare by by that point almost the only people who were running for president were absolute ambition psychos wh 'who wanted it more than anything, goldwater kind of had to be pulled uh reluctantly into it uh, and the funniest thing also is that you know he was this huge, you know, he was thought of as this uh fire brand of the new right, you know, and he famously said in his acceptance speech at the convention uh in San Francisco, the at the cow palace, uh, extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, but he was also an incredibly boring uncharismatic speaker and he would go to these rallies filled with young right-wing exeberants and YaF guys and and you people hooting and holler and and and he would show up and he would just start reading off of his prepared remarks and the fucking the energy would just slowly fall out of the room and everyone would just sort of get bored. he just he had no he didn't have it. i just like the phrasing of this question, i don't even know if it's worth. talking about, but uh, could Q create an American Sulla? Actually, that's not a terrible question, because if we're if we accept, and I think this is an accept, this is an unarguable premise that the only institution with any kind of durable legitimacy in America is the U.S. military. now you can argue that the US military isn't as powerful as it seems because they do spend a lot of money on uh just laundering and and and uh and column padding and and graft and like... lot of it is is is potemkin military power uh and it's just sort of we're coasting on our you know our reputation and our like military footprint and just how much money we spend how much of the like global capital goes to our military uh that that's like a dominant position so like if we ever had to use it that's there's that's still a question mark but i think domestically it could absolutely be used it's certainly has more uh you know uh legitimacy uh and and an infrastructure within the country. that it could in a time of crisis be something that is the spearpoint of a, a military uh intervention in and sublimation of the political process, and if that happens, all you need is a few people at the top of the military hierarchy who have absorbed Q, and I don't think that that's that's that's now happening, because the thing about the military officer core is that. they are almost exclusively guys who, say it with me, went to college, they went to college, they absorbed a lot of the nicities and like the the uh, the norms of uh our system, not all of them, like Michael Flynn is a genuine Waco and there plenty like that guy uh boiken, Jerry Boiken was a crazy person, but they are not a majority at the very top of the military archy, but that could absolutely change as the composition of the military changes with time, as people is the only people like the only people who are moving their way through the ranks are people who are motivated by a belief in this transcendent que based millenniary fantasy then they're going to like these people running for office who are going to now be in congress like they they will it's not like go those people who are now going to be in congress they're not going to be disabused from Q being real by their by their coworkers you know what i mean and that's a similar function thing that could happen in the military uh and then if you have enough of a crisis and the right people are in power uh you might have yourself a q-based military dictatorship in this country or at least in some part of this country where like uh the writ could be uh uh enforced but it's certainly it's certainly in the deck of possible outcomes so that's fun it's I know we've commented on it many times but it's very I'm really hoping that in the next Congress somebody. um read some queue shit into congressional records, we're going to have it, we're going to have it for sure cuz we're we have two q people who are basically locked in, and the one in Georgia, her opponent dropped out of the race, so she's... opposed now so she's already in uh and the in Delaware, RIP Jes Scaraine fucking Croocks in Delaware, it's it really is showing bause they had good, they had good in Delaware they had good results at the lower level, but it it's the commanding heights of politics within a state or in the nation are still uh, it's with it's beyond the organizational capacity of the left, I think to really have any hope of influencing these outcomes, which I think I mean we didn't know that for sure, but I think now the evidence. is pretty clear, but her uh coons, Chris Coon's opponent is a queue person, she she won the republican primary, she's also a flat earther, yes, which is so funny because there was so like, I'm sure one of the big reasons Coons was able to hold up that uh, get that majority was scaring people about, oh we don't want a republican in there, and I mean, I don't think in Delaware, they're ready for a queue person and yet, uh, uh, against you, a a bog standard like social democrat, I think that the social democrat would win in Delaware, but we don't have to see it now, uh, and apparently it's because like we've seen in a lot of these primaries, a big surgeon voting amongst rich suburbanites, and there's a lot of people who have kind of convinced themselves that Biden's going to lose because this campaign is terrible and it's very much like Hillary's campaign in 2016, and that's true, but there's another thing happening and that is you've seen it all throughout primaries in the last two years and even since COVID is a big surge in democratic voting and democratic. marries among these wealthier suburbanites who generally either tip republican or are more balanced between the two partiess and if that holds into september if that holds into November Biden's going to win comfortably that that I was also I think weigel was tweeting about that yeah the the other day and that does seem to be the major story of the last two years is that it is a a uh the the electorate is is reactionary old people from both sides you're either like towards the right end of liberal or the righter end of right, fighting about whether woodstock was good, yeah, that's all it is, and they all they have, they do not vote based on material interests because they're either secured, or they believe that they cannot be or shouldn't be interfered with by the government one way or the other, and it's just pure cultural war fight, and there's no, there's no good news about Biden winning with that coalition because it will guarantee the hunger chancellorship that we're afraid of, we're going to guarantee the austerity, depression. off presidency that were that we're dreading uh, but I think a lot of people think Biden will lose because he deserves to lose, but I really think that we should have absorbed by now the reality that as clin eastwood said at unforgiven, deserves got nothing to do with it. You know, like his appeal might seem baffling and horrible to to us, but if it is reassuring to enough suburban whites who make up the majority of voters in this country in places that matter anyway. then he's gonna win. uh, I was realistening to it because I put it in the episode Monday, but his uh, his quote about having no empathy for the young people, that's so awesome, no empathy, fuck them kids, but the real thing, the real thing that was that made me actually fume is the thing that he says after that, the thing about I have no empathy for them complaining, because the thing that he follows it up with is when we were that age, we we went out there and changed things for the better. and I'm like, what, are you, what are you taking, what are you taking credit for here, the civil rights movement? well, that's the boomer thing, that's the boomer slight of hand, is that no matter what they did particularly, and Biden, what he did was as a as a fucking uh, as a 29-year old was uh, go in the senate as a new democrat opposed to uh bussing, that was his actual thing, it was like, channeling demo, he was a democrat who was channeling the the alien. with the republican corruption, but not embracing any of the scary racial stuff that was at the leading edge of like the left movement, like being the being the sensible democrat, that was his pitch, and then being in office and like fighting, fighting integration and uh and becoming wall street's uh best friend from the beginning and and just carrying water for uh for the fire sector, his entire fucking... career, but all this other stuff happened, like civil rights happened also, you know, uh, yeah, the war in Vietnam was ended also, and for a lot of these fucking old people, they've decided, yeah, we did that, yeah, we did that collectively, and I am part of that we, even though I personally was just a a grasping shitty little fucking word healer, looking to pat my own goddamn fucking nest, which is all he's ever been, or taking, taking credit for like what, like great society programs that they've then spent the next 50. years trying to undermine and and and take apart, and by the time he took office, they were already doing that, he wasn't, he was only there for the dismantaling part, he wasn't even there for the building of it part, uh, anyway that really. infuriated me the the second part of that, yeah, that's how they're able to justify their position of just sitting on sitting on this home stock thinking that it's going to turn them in the millionaires because they have a coming because look at all the stuff we did, we went on the moon, no you fucking didn't, you you you smoked ditchweed in a fucking conversion van, fuck off, you didn't go anywhere, you skipped your skipped your college graduation to see the rolling stones, like my mom did, which is actually, that's actually cool, that is very cool, i would have done the same thing, uh, let's see, all right, let's... we're coming up right at an hour, let's do a fun one, you know, something about uh more more questions about tv or food um, oh man, i'm hungry again by the way, last couple, last couple you've seen, the last couple i meat, i'm i'm doing this before dinner and i just start having reveries about food stuffs, i am now, chris, i am now, i am now subscribed to a dipping sauce, oh you are, yes, is it that that that korean sauce? yes, i went to buy more of it, what happened? I went on Amazon to buy more of it and it had the little subscribe, it had the subscribe thing, and I'm like, you know what, uh, yes, this is my thing, this is my sauce now, so uh, I am now subscribed to a dipping sauce, which means that I uh, you could kill me uh, and it would not be a crying, at least not morally, in my opinion, uh, I will say that I um, am, Molly and I were talking last night, and we are um committed to getting the cactus jack meal sometime this weekend, we're going to go do it. Oh man, let me know if you're going, if I'm available, I'd like to go too, are there any cartoons that Matt and Chris recommend, as far as I know, Matt only likes one cartoon, Ricky Morty, Ricky Morty, which is good, I of course recommend the venture brothers, one of the greatest TV series, very, by the way, my condolences that they cancel it, it's it's very bad, but I think I bet it's going to come back somehow, and also oh yeah, no, nothing goes away anymore, now if it's if it's any kind of ip that has any sort of any sort of impression with any even the micro niche, there will be... a place for it, because new stuff is done for it, honestly the venture brothers is also so beloved by its fan base they could start a patreon to just make a new and they would fund it in and like a flip book that the mail in for no just do the it's just like two guys who make it they could just i'm sure that the budget that thing could be raised by its fans yeah but it's not it isn't it hand it's the handmade though it's not like a car it's not like a computer animation it's traditionally animated yeah yeah see that's that's where the money is going to go in cuz you have to hire people to fucking draw those little guys also a long good shows uh i was just watching some future ama episodes uh the other day and um reminded that that show rips that future ama had a peak there where it was really good for a bit uh then it came back and it was pretty much just bad another thing that they should that may can bring back from the dead just turn it into a fucking zombie version no one of the i think one of the movies they made was okay i remember liking one of them i think the first one was the first one was good but i could have just been blinded by my my my soy facing and then the next and then the new show was dreadful, yes, leave things as uh, as as fred Gwinn said in pet cemetery, sometimes dead is better, uh, let's see, um, I have not seen corporate, but I went to college with the guy makes it, shout out pat bishop. he's a good guy um uh i would like to see corporate um the show yeah i heard it was pretty good yeah i really want a tc tugger yeah that's one of those products that i saw and it's like yeah that's a joke but i could go for one of those uh nob right here do you do you now know the name of the sauce that you'd subscribed to it's like cjs cjs is the name of like the brand cj apostrophes and that's like b bimbop sauce or something like that it's very good or it's gojuchan, it's a gojuchan sauce, but it's like it's got ketchup consistency, and the brand is cjs, yeah, all right, let's end on this cuz i know you have uh, you have some thoughts about how hollywood does its business, uh, oh brother, do I ever uh, the the question is phrase is like how does the pandemic can transform the current hollywood model uh can the studios justify huge budget for something that will only be streaming blah blah blah like basically do you see this as an ac do you think this is going to be an actual inflection point? uh, i don't think you can tell yet, because there is a very good chance that like if burn hollywood burn indeed, good reference, if we can get a lit on coronavirus in the next year, that there might be an absolute explosion of movie, like we could have another like uh a mini uh renaissance of film going just buse people are happy to be able to go and like they're just going to be like, yes, i'll go see a movie, i'll go seear movie, it's a movie, it's in a movie theater, i want to have this experience, and that could like keep it going, like like give it a little burst. to keep like the the the the the business model intact uh, but it's it is clearly in a terminal decline, it was in a terminal decline before corona is the thing, and this could be the bullet to the head of old yeller, and i think a lot of it comes down to are they are are these studios, are the movie theater chains able to hold on in the absence of revenue long enough to not just... just abandon the fucking model and find something else. i saw somebody tweeting again something that i thought was very funny uh something that like netflix should open a line of movie theaters and i think that that is like would be so perfect just to go all the way back around to the original hollywood netflix owns movie theaters they do yes they've bought they've bought i think they bought a closed movie theater in la and they bought a movie theater a single mark a single screen theater in New York because until recently this might change now to to get the screening requirements exactly the netflix movie could not be eligible for awards if they were not screened in the theater and so they bought theaters just to show the movies so that they could be eligible for awards uh and that's it's it's all about like legitimizing netflix like as a brand that is on par with cinematic output right uh and so if as long as that rule is intact uh they'll have a motivation at least to to have theaters be existent, but I think that's one of those things that's going to go away, if if the business model changes that those those requirements are going to go away too, um, yeah, I do, yeah, I do just think it would be funny to just go back to the system where the the the studios own the theaters, I do think it's very funny that uh, that Christopher Nolan, they allowed, Warner brothers allowed Christopher Nolen to cost them like a half a billion dollars, because if they had released tenent like two months ago. on VOD for $20, it would have made a billion dollars. I would have bought it. Instead, they like letting it out in drips and drabs, it's it's made like 20 million dollars in the US and like the few theaters where people are deciding to go see them, which baffling to me, uh, but it's and but they might eventually cave and put it on VOD, but by that point it'l up and all of the mystique, like Nolan's all deal is mysteque, like this is the one visionary director who is allowed to make his own stuff with a big budget and he's got all these mind bending twists. and now it's all going to leak out, it's all going to leak out and and and become just some more shit, it's going to get normalized and and and denatured, and if they even if they cave and put it out on VOD, it's not going to make the money it would have, and it's all because they buse he got such a position because of his previous successes that he was able to essentially leverage that to avoid a release uh on streaming that would have actually made money, it's kind of amazing, like he's a one man wrecking crew, he's a he's like michael chamine. all over again uh somebody in chat i'll i'll end with a little uh self congratulations, somebody in chat was reminding me that one of my predictions uh new year's in our new year's episode which would be a hilarious to go back oh god i need to relisten to that holy shit somebody somebody uh we were we were a lot of uh we were we were just one collective bunch of uh of oh what the fuck's his name the guy from uh the edwood movies the mentalist, i i don't, the future is the place where we will all be spending the rest of our lives. Jeffrey Jones played a banned wood anyway, that was us. uh, somebody reminded me that one of my predictions would was this was going to be the year that one of the marvel cinematic universe movies finally failed and we got to start seeing the cracks in their system, and i got to congratulate myself because i was correct, but not for why i thought i would be. yeah, well hey, you know. you didn't say why? that's true, i didn't put any stipulations on it. yeah, um, all right, we're at 1:11 for this. um, i think we're going to sign off today, unless you got anything else, mat? no, i'm good. okay, great. i got to find out who the fuck was that guy? uh, criswell, chriswell, that's it. all right, thank you chat. creation, yes, indeed, creation, gucci gucci, louwi, vendy vendy prada. uh, we'll leave you with that. uh, say goodnight matt. goodnight, matt.
