 I heard why people invented existential anx of other problems, buse the thing about those problems was typically more money would solve them, hello, I'm back, like Joey's world tour, I'm a little sweaty right now, so the hair is looking uh positively uh gordon geccoin right now trying to get the thing here all right i didn't want to talk about this but now i feel like since it's the very first thing i got. in the chat i have to, the goddamn thing in DC. you can point out the fact, the obvious fact that such a trivial encounter should not be something that anybody knows about, and that only the reality of of our fast twitch muscle, social media diet would even make it possible for something that insignificant to become something you would know about, let alone something that you would form very strong opinions around related to your larger like political goals andologies, that's kind of absurd, and of course other stuff's happening, fucking kanosha is on fire, there's a guy was walking from mowakie to dc, got shot by some psycho, but it's all over there, and the thing about it that makes me want to talk about it is the same thing is related to what i said yesterday about ops, someone says was it libs or an op, i thought that's great, that's a perfect, this is as insignificant an episode of it as it is, we can't use it to try to suss out some broader questions, and I talked yesterday about how the compulsion to turn everything into an op, eventually leaves to the point where you can no longer distinguish the mechanisms of propaganda and you know state control and uh intelligence from just the mechanisms of capitalism creating a a cultural uh superstructure out of material relationships, but there's another big part. that i actually forgot to mention that directs ties directly to this, and that is that another big driver, another another big problem with uh the the instinctive desire, the instinctive belief to see something like that and think up, for those of you don't know what i'm talking about, there was a video today of some people who attacked some brunchers or i didn't attack them, but they a bunch of mostly white uh, black lives matter protesters just getting in the faces of of... people who are not giving them the power fist in response and just screaming at this woman for not doing the fist and a lot of people are going ooh ah that is that really helpful and a lot of people are saying like we heard from the first person is this enough and i understand that desire because who wants to take credit for that even like as just at the abstract level of i agree broadly with the sentiment that they're trying to to protest on behalf of uh but the instinct to call it an op is the instinct to sooth your cognitive dissonance. It's to say, oh, this thing, this movement that I I supported, that sometimes I even feel that I may be a part of if I participate in protest or something, is doing something I don't agree with, ah shit, the the it's the authorities, they're doing this, no one who is really true of heart like me, would yell at some random person, uh, that's crazy, that must be the work of of the dead dastardly deep state, and absent any evidence, and all of this happens immediately when nobody has any context at all, let alone evidence, i think that comes more than anything, not from like a recognition of the role of intelligence in propaganda or reality, it comes from a desire to sooth cognitive dissonance, and soothing cognitive dissonance through the creation of narratives of conspiracy is literally how we got Qing on, and I don't think that's necessarily going to happen on the left. because you know the the incents are different, the social structure of the people involved is different, or the social like context of the people involved is different. uh, but what is not different uh is that it? is a soothing bulm that leads you away from confronting reality, and if you're on the left, confronting reality is very, very important, because you don't have the luxury of capital to be buff to buffer your your failures of analysis and your failures of of strategy, you are out there, we're all out here on our on our own, we don't we aren't, we aren't able to uh to be like q and on might come true because eventually the reactionary forces in this country might just come to believe it to justify the actions they were going to do anyway, that's not because they organized, that's not because their delusions were correct, it's because that was the flow of history, and they're going with the flow, they're salmon or no, they're not salmon, they're the other ones, the left is salmon, you're swimming upstream, you don't have the benefit of being able to just soothe yourself with this notion that oh, we're in an incredibly collapsed timeline here, and everyone who is politically active really has to be thinking in terms of what they could do in the here and now to push things in a positive direction to go oh everything that's bad that happens is part of any left project is the is the is the police is an op one that's just you soothing yourself and making you fail and and allowing you to ignore the real problems that this thing creates which i'll talk about in a second but secondly uh Even if it's true, so what? Oh, it's an op. All right, so what? Can you prove it's an op or are you going to go bust the guy who did it and have him confess? No, it's just a way what, when you tell other someone else it's an op, you just want them to read it and then not worry anymore, so your strategy for defeating the deep state is just telling people there's a deep state, I mean, once again, not effective, soothing, coping, and I understand why people want to cope. we're not blaming anybody for this because my god why wouldn't people want to fucking cope when there's so little on the horizon that looks like there's any hope but but compensating for that by indulging in in personally uh personal personally soothing and pleasing and uh exciting exercises at the expensive efficacy is actually counterproductive it's a waste of time and resources that can't be wasted there's no time and and when something like this pops up, you can say it's bullshit that everyone's talking about this, yeah, does that change anything? okay, it's bullshit, it's bullshit people are talking about this, correct, are they still talking about it, oh no, they are, it's an op, okay, it's an op, now what, the same people who believed it was, the exact people thought it was an op at the beginning still think that no one else does because they don't have your epistemic window that makes it look like an op before anything else. now what? the fact is, even if was an op, there would be no way to isolate it, because there's no movement, there's no organized movement that can either like endorse or ratify the actions of any particular outcropping of this, this leaderless kind of passionate outbursting that we're seeing, which is totally predictable and understandable given the horrible conditions and be give given things like monstrous, horrifying police execution. that everybody gets to watch on television, but that desire to cleanse oneself of the feeling of guilt and the feeling of rage cannot overcome our greater uh commitment and duty to stopping it, and seeing something like that and not making you, making it you and not having it make you stop and say, okay, what are we doing here instead to just have an ex excuse a complaint and then to move on, you're not going to get anywhere, you're not wrong in some sort of ideal sense, but that's not the fucking point, the point, as someone once said, is not to describe the world, but to change it, and if your big piece of evidence that it's an op is, I don't think people would do that, people. no, it has to be like dastardly libs or police officers, people i agree with would never do that. you're telling me that in a country of 300 million adult infants who have been indulged their entire lives along uh the the notion that that the sum total of human freedom is their personal happiness, whatever that means, oh here's what it means, we're going to tell you what happiness is, you're telling me that even that if people in that context find themselves horrified by a genuine... effective tranches of behavior, absent that that we're going to go to what feels good, and what could feel better than screaming in someone's fucking face and making them hold up their hand for you, that that isn't a power trip, i i just i find that a plausible motivation, i think that's something the people could do absent the government telling them to, or absent it being a uh a total false flag. the people i encounter in this world, in this country, they're the kind of people who would do that. oh, i to scream in someone's face and be the good guy uh and so you have that and then there's the greater and then there's the other problem that it's not like everybody is saying that this is a terrible thing some people are saying that this is a good this is good or that fuck them it's it's like what's the big you know it's like oh crap boohoo yeah of course it's nothing who cares in terms of like broad but as a as a strategy like if these things are supposed to be examples of actions to create difference there are people who see this and they think that it's a good thing to do and i got a i got a tweet here from someone and i know yeah blah blah you shouldn't go on twitter but this is a person with not no followers and somebody who seems to be somewhere in here and i just i'm going to read this because it seems to be to be exemplary of the mindset of someone would see that and think it was a good idea. the thing about protesting that it's not supposed to cause a crisis of leader is that it's supposed to cause a crisis of leadership. if someone doesn't want to be screamed at by BLM protesters while eating they should call their local pauls and and they rain in the fucking cops. now i would agree with that. the reason i quoted that is not because like look at all these people think that because i think that's actually the thought process. i think that is the correct thought process. if you were to like split open the brains of the people doing this in good faith, i think you would find this is the basic idea, that if you get everybody on your side through either persuasion and if that fails through coversion of social pressure, in in medieval Germany they used to call it cat music. if somebody in the in like a village or a hamlet was a real prick uh because there was no real law enforcement people would gather in front of their house and they bang pots and pans and they wouldn't let them sleep and it would tell them to shape up and a lot of people actually see that as a model for restorative justice absent the carcerial state which i mean once again if you want to have if you're talking if you're assuming a feudal level of social relationship a feudal level of social connectedness and inter wovenness maybe we can start talking but if you don't have that that's not going to be a good idea, but but so then everybody does that. now of course, that's not the only response you can have from someone doing this. the other, the next tweet from this person is, or they can go sign up on racist subreddit because now they want a race war. it's their choice. the protest force them to make one. and i think that gets it another thing that's essential here, is that that kind of action is not designed to change things, so much as it is designed to separate the good people from the bad people, by doing it by banging at yelling at somebody, by demanding they move their hand in public, by bullying someone, by the way, they're not hitting cops anymore, at least in DC, and it's like, I get that, why would you want to risk that, why would you want to get your split, get your head split open without any hope it's going to lead to anything? uh, I would want to fight with the cops either with a lack, any kind of lack of plan behind it, I could yell at somebody with no plan behind it, because what's that, what's the downside for me, and I get to feel like a big big person, I get to feel like I'm bossing somebody around, which everybody wants, everybody wants to be care. but Karen, people want to be kararen, not just so they can dominate others, but because it is a model for getting things done in a consumer context, yelling at the man, yelling at an employee till he brings a manager, then yelling at the manager is a way to get the discount because you have basically badgered the company into doing doing it to make you go away, that's what they're talking about, they're saying yell at people attack people until they they do what you want to make them go away, and what that assumes always? is that the people in charge are will always be there, there will always be a separate class of political and economic uh elite and that your only way of changing their behavior, the changing the conditions of your life is by getting them to change their actions, even though things like having like our police state, are not optional to capitalism as it's currently exists, these things are not just fun gigigas, this is the core functions of the state, all the stuff that was superfluous has already gone. they sold it off, the stuff that's left is the real steel, it's the exoskeleton of the state, they're not going to give it up, no matter what if you complain too much, if it really becomes a problem, they will make you stop complaining, and this and so the only way to stop that horrible police state we have is to organize to defeat it, replace it, replace the political system and replace the economic system, that's your only way around that, you're not going to get them to change something that is a crucial piece of the architecture of like capitalism, a load bearing structure, they're not going to kick it away cuz you said so because you asked, because you dabbed on some people who are eating. eggs benedict, but they don't even know that what they're talking about is karanism because they're because that's the only thing they've ever known, complaining to the manager is all people know in this country, because we've never had the disciplinary experiential behavior of having a social uh, a social element added to our personal pleasure seeking id through collective. action through working through working together at something like I don't a labor union. We're coming together as individuals, we're marketing together in a big group, but nobody knows each other, and in that in that environment, there's going to be no, there's going to be no strategy, there's only going to be letting up. your frustration, your anger, your your sense of guilt if you're white, and a lot of the people yelling we're white, your sense of complicity, you want to yell it out, and then you can convince yourself, oh, if I yell enough, they're going to do what I want them to do, well, I mean, if the thing is is is optional, if it's if it's something up in the up in the cultural element of culture, like what tv shows are on or you know, whether there's interracial couples in television ads or, if there's a... spider-man, that's negotiable, the police are not negotiable, but nobody has ever had any effect on their lives, on the l oh boy uh effective activism that wasn't just asking, it wasn't just demanding to make other people do something, someone is else, someone in charge is going to do it, but that's not going to work, we have to change it, because at this point the things we're pissed at are not optional. unless you really care about stuff like uh, you know, having LBGTQ uh marvel characters, if you care about things like the viability of the planet uh and the fact that like a democracy is just turning into even even the fucking even the kabukuki of democracy is being replaced by uh just sheer authoritarian uh exertion. I mean we're on the verge of electing a president without who didn't even win the popular vote twice in a row who is going to... to bring upon himself unprecedented power, but any president would do that, and that's why fascism is such a bad thing to be banging on about right now, because if there's going to be camps in the near future for people, if we're going to get rounded up, Biden would do it too, it'll just be a different people, maybe it'll be a different group of people getting rounded up, maybe it'll be a more racially inclusive group of people rather than just minorities to get rounded up, but it will be a rounding up and it will have a neoliberal uh, smiley face gloss on it, but it will be the same thing, because it will be necessitated by the conditions, by the crisis. I'm not saying that will happen, but I'm saying, it's not like Trump's going to snap his fingers and make it happen from a position of carrying out a a a fascist coo, it's going to be a seading to a crisis that cannot be otherwise contained, and that crisis would exist under Biden. There's going to be some some rain, I think, there's some fat boys coming, some fat, fat rainboys coming, uh, but yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, nobody wants to confront the fact that a lot of the a lot of what we think of as as an uprising is really just people getting their jollies in one way or another, including the people online cheering them on, or talking about them, or even us talking about them, me talking about them, all just getting a little bit of pleasure. rather than doing effective action, and that who wants to confront that reality? that sucks, and it's and it is terrible, but I do think that, till you confront it, you can't really break the cycle, oh boy, oh yeah, I might not make it an hour out here guys. We'll see, I might have to start running soon, but the reality is is that you you can argue all you want about whether it's good to burn a building, you can't press a button button and stop them from doing it or press a button and make people do it, you can't vote on it, you can't make it happen or not happen, you can't make or not make, group of people yell at some uh... in dc, it's everyone just operating out of out of i hate lean on a clutch, lean on a verbal crutch, but it's very crucial in this case, labinal political instinct, the desire to, when I mean by that, more than anything, is a individualized, id-based political instinct, that is not to achieve a better world, but is to gain the pleasures associated with feeling that you are on the right side of history, and the thing about that is that's got to motivate everybody to an extent, but it has to connect also to a greater project which will the exercising of which will bleed your need for the... bidnal because you're getting results, or even if you're not getting results, you're feeling comradship, you're feeling effective in a narrow sense, in a way that you never will by going out and hollering at people, but that means that that drive is only going to become more more fixating because over time you need to uh compensate more and more for the lack of effectiveness, lacan's good, lacan is correct on a lot of stuff, come on. Especially since the lot of central shit is just buddhism, it's just buddhism with continental gloss, it's buddhism with a baguette up its ass. Okay, holy macro, woo, I got the, I got the uh, I got the black cherry, all right guys, maybe we can get in and still record, but I got to get out of here, it is gonna come down, guys haven't been inside for a while, i've been not since my neighbor scared me back in by uh telling me to stop hooting and hollering out there, i'm back to hooting and hollering. All right, how's everybody doing? We're back in the house, we're back in the New York groove, indoors, bad as I want to be, someone wants to know what authoritarian uh, neoliberalism is going to. look like, and I would say uh, China, it's a good example, uh, Brazil, uh, letting all the letting boat people drown in the Mediterranean, I mean it's all happening, you know, uh, the apocalypse already has happened, it's just not evenly distributed. Singapore is a very good example, yes, but mostly it's going to be about pairing around the edges, it's about, it's going to be about creating new borders and liminal. bases that can be negotiated violently, because for the length of American history, America was able to export its most like dysfunctional social pathologies onto its border regions and it was always pushing out that way and able to push them out that way, and that's why they never had to confront them, that's why we never had a real like socialist movement in this country, one of the big reasons, but now that we've hit all borders, that we've hit the edge of space, we are now having to reinscribe borders, to find a new liminal space for maximal violence, where people, where where citizens are allowed to carry out the maximum amount of violence uh and the people subject to their violence are not part of the conceived of group of right bearing citizens, it's a gambin stuff, you know what I'm talking about, the homossur and... We have those at the border now and those borders will just be increased, they will become other places, they will probably become distributed within the United States, around cities, probably, specific areas. of of like where where where the cataclysm is hitting most direly, places attacked by global warming uh flooding like consistent wildfires uh desertification uh urban areas that are like where where there we're not where the there's the cycle of like police violence and response is is made uh permanent like right now it's sort of it's uh it waxes aways like we had It's not getting compressed, like the the time from, like think of the time it took to get from uh, you know, uh, so like you got Mike Brown to uh, to uh, Baltimore, and now we've got uh, from George Floyd, three months later, like the violence is going to go up, which means the cycle is going to speed up, which means the intervals are going to get shorter, and eventually it just becomes a permanent. condition and that's a new border, that's a new internal border that where you get to exercise uh, maximal violence, and the the reason that this isn't fascism is because there is still that social continuum within that are with out, I'm sorry, the places beyond those borders, that's still the same atomized social slurry of... consumers basically being free to consume that we have now, it will be functionally identical, there will not be marching jackboots in the streets, there's not going to be a new flag with like a weird symbol a weird rune on it, you know, there's not going to be jack boots, there's not going to be theater, there's not going to be this frision of of apocalypse, of of revelation of of the truth of the whole condition, and for the left is the validation of their worldview, I've always said that America was fascist and now I have been proven correct. That moment, which is I think undergirding a lot of the fantasy projection of American fascism, that won't happen. I highly highly doubt it. What you will have is you will have the border regions within and at the edge where violence is maximally applied, and then you will have America where we're doing ticks or whatever progress goes after tik tock and we're arguing over the problematic content of... uh Aquaman versus uh Bernie Geettz no Gilliant what are you talking about oh my god no it's just like this only more people are dying and there are fewer people uh we are still living our absurdly inflated consumer standard of living at the very end of the global supply chain. do you understand the distinction? i think that the the i guess the what i what i find most visible about the fascist framing is that it seems to me to be at a certain level a a a fantasy, something that deeply at a level, i mean not in terms of their morals, you know, they are they are horrified by fascism and want to defeat it, and in fact the fantasy of fascism is what gives their actions romance and and uh power to them and and give allows them to expend or gone along the axis of politics, it's it's the horribleness of that possibility, and then if you talk about it a lot and say it's coming, it's occurrence is a validation, and i feel like that, that means that you're not looking at reality, that means that you are abstracting, and i just have to like as a general rule as a rubric, i could look at somebody who's fixated on fascism and say this person is they're not their eye isn't on the ball, they're and so they're going to be more likely, and haven't you noticed by the way, the people the most fixated on fascism and calling what we're in fascism, are also the most committed to things like theatrical, demonstrative, non-organized political action to replace real either electoral or labor activism and organization, like spectacular demonstrations of anti-fascist sentiment. and that's because they think we're at a level of social development that we are not. we need to organize way more people. getting people needs to be the only question. sorting people has to come later, these people want to sort. remember that tweet i wrote you, uh, the tweet that said, hey, they'll either tell, they'll either call up the mayor and tell him to get rid of racism, which wow, it's it's so nice that we they could do that. uh, or they'll go and become a storm front editor and uh get a gun and be. militia member, that's not good, you don't want that to happen to somebody who's like not engaged, you want to minimize that, but no, if you're... is sorting people into good and bad, then you're you want that to happen, I'm saying we cannot be sorting, we need to be organizing everybody who has any genuine axis of alienation, that is aware of capitalism, that is aware of their their misery being connected to the system of the economy, the that they have not been captured by fantasys of like racism being the cause of all evil or uh queue people. thinking that it's hollywood hollywood pedophiles or jews or whatever right-wing fantasy you need to to square the reality of living under somebody else's design in a free country. if you ident if you are under if you're aware at all that there is a class component to your emiseration then you have to be engaged with, and of course that's going to make people uncomfortable, but that discomfort gets edged out through actual behavior together, but it will never get etched out in the phantom realm of online, where all disagreement has now defined as or can be defined as abuse, how many people think being disagreed with is abusing someone? now if you really thought that in your day-to-day behavior, you wouldn't be able to... and committed to racism or deeply misoginistic and hostile to women uh, or wildly, wildly reactionary about some group of people, they and and that they can't get rid of that, well they can maintain that all they want online as they duel with the SJWs and in fact the more they believe those things the more they trigger people they hate so they can believe in them more. if they really wanted to alleviate their misery and they can understood it as a result as that class action was the only thing that would do it, they wouldn't fucking... bring that shit up, and even if they still thought it, it wouldn't matter, because they would have to accommodate to organizing into the group, and that would mean that either it would go, or they would alienate everybody else and they get kicked out, they would have to choose between actually trying to fix things and holding on to this bullshit, just like people would have to choose between actually trying to thick things and holding on to the all disagreement is is abuse, all experiences should be totally frictionless, no one should ever have any conflict at all, and that i'm going to that belief to badger everyone else into basically never disagreeing with me, none of those, neither of those are sustainable beliefs in or genuinely effective left-wing organization, at this point everyone now like people like to say, oh look at the UAW, look at the C, look at all the racists and the old crafts unions, history has moved forward, I'm afraid, and a lot of those problems that shattered the labor movement in the 60s, a lot of them, not all of them, for the love of God, not all of them, but of course not all of them have been resolved, we are dealing with... with a fundamentally less instinctively racist population than we'd had to deal with in the 60s, and that means that the people who even are racist can be dealt with as long as they think they can make their lives better through class collaboration. so this desire to separate the sheep from the goats, the fascists from the anti-fascists, all of it does is to serve to guarantee that the feuest people are going to make the step from online to the real world, the feuest people are going to want to talk to other people in the real world about politics and try to figure out how to fix things, and the more of them are going to sink all of their fucking gism, all of their nut, all of their oregon, all of their life essence into battling on the etheric plane, because they get to hold on to their bullshit, they get to hold on to their greasy little... center of of of perverted pleasure, whether it's a racial fixation, sexual inadequacy brought on by being a gross and unfuckable incel, or the trauma associated with with you, being a minority that that manifest itself in such a way that you cannot countenance, you are so distrustful of non-whites or or men if you're a woman that you cannot ever trust their motives in any situation and have to constantly prove to yourself on your side, because you fundamentally do not trust them, and I'm not saying that you don't have a good reason not to trust man if you're a woman or uh white people if you're black, but I am saying that if you cannot. let go of that, make a, say it with me, folks, leap of faith sufficient to meet someone that way, a man or a a white person halfway, then you will leave, and that's fine, that's the kind of person who should not be part of an organization, but guess what, the bet of marxism, the bet of socialism, the bet of the human race is that major, the majority of people, if they properly understand that moment and that choice, will choose to cooperate and will choose? to put the greater good above their own, but they have to see evidence that there's a reason to do it, or else it all comes back to the south and the disgusting little jackoff session in your pants. Oh dear, I'm afraid I went off again. Oh boy, I afraid, I am afraid that I have gone down again. I have gone, I have gone off, sirs and madams that may be watching. but that's fine, that's fine, i am uh sipping not the te but the sales, i'm i hope the uh thing isn't shaking too much, but i don't really have anywhere to put my phone, i have the thing out there, i'm not even sure if it's raining, it just felt like it was going to, k baby, give me some kier guard. he's in the stew, when i think of who's in the gumbo, who's in my mental gumbo, he's in there, spinoza, h guard for sure, witgenstein, i think, nichi definitely, and of course playdo because forms are crucial, someone wants me to talk about the potavian. republic uh, there are other listeners to the age of Napoleon podcast out there, because today, I in fact also just listen to his episode about the end of the uh, the peace that followed the war of the second coalition, but tavian republic just makes me think of uh, it just makes me think of... uh pretzels, i don't know why, but i just think of a pretzel, big hot, a hot pretzel with mustard when i hear batavian, it's it's deeply, it's pavlovian i don't know where it came from, now i really want a big oh god, i want a big oh, big soft pretzel with mustard, not nacho sauce, mustard for sure, oh big bavaria, and i know it's i know it's the potavian republic, not the bavarian republic, but maybe it's the... close enough that they make me think of it, god damn, you guys just make me want a pretzel, but i don't really know much about switzerland, it's very interesting, i mean when you consider how how suis it is in Europe to this day in terms of a country, like it broke off for the holy Roman emperor very early and then i guess you know because of its defensible physical position was able to establish independence from all of the reigning houses uh you know of of the middle. is in the early modern era and uh an institute what uh what Harry lime and the third man called the 500 years of democracy and peace what did it bring us the kuo clock and that's the funny thing about Switzerland they cut themself off they like basically signed off and said we're done with this and you didn't really ever hear from them again they just sat there collecting money they made the smart move it's like Mussolini was half right when he said blood alone moves the wheel of history it's like well blood first. but then gold and the swiss knew, why fight these wars when you can make money? they were the first really effective mercenaries in the in the medieval era where were the swiss uh the swiss pikem your lange connects, and now they get to just sit there in their mountain castle in the hall of the mountain king counting their duckets, it's uh... It's it's sinister, oh fuck, that was the helvetica republic, you're right, octavian Republic were the Dutch, yeah, uh, the dutch one, I like that they ate a guy, dutch rebels one time ate a dude, they ate a governor, they were mad at, that's amazing, god damn i know lanch. for german, i thought they were supposed to, they added a dude uh when uh, i like the fact that they'... got a 90 years war, which people don't know, normally know about, or 80 years war, rather, the 80, they got an 80 years war, but yeah, all those sister republics were failures, as as I think Everet does a good job of talking about on the episode today, because they were not organic. "you know, they did not, they did not adhere to the social soil because they were imposed from without. contradictions have to be worked from within, worked out from within a social order, which is why honestly a lot of the soviet fantasies of like of of revolutionary war, like the guys like bukaren who wanted to continue the war uh under the flag of the you know of class revolution, stuff imposed from without even if it's like even if you are representing like the correct." force of history or the progressive side of history, you still have to contend with local conditions, and that's why the idea that you can like invade and impose betterness, I mean, it never worked, it didn't work for the French, and it it didn't work really for any of the uh, any of the marxist or you know what, so-called marxist states of the 20th century. It it's sort of a macro version of how you can't scream at someone's face to raise their fist and expect that to work, like who are you, you're just some asshole, like they don't, they they haven't bought your, they haven't gotten your assumptions, they aren't sharing a lot of your assumptions to so that they're gonna there's going to be a lot of cultural and and uh symbolic screens between your understanding of the reality and all you can do is stoke the fires for internal resolution of of contradiction, which is why the wrong as shit, they want world revolution so much that they think we can make it happen, because it has to happen soon if we're going to get world socialism or any kind of socialism, like we're going to have to they believe we're going to the real thing is they believe you can't get rid of capitalism with until you have a world system and might actually have a point with that, I don't know, I haven't thought about it that much honestly, but like the reasoning is when you look at what happened with the Soviet Union, if you're in a world market system, you will suborn yourself to it, that's why they became deformed mark marks, deformed worker states like they called them, and they talked about the rise of the bureaucratic class that had to manage the state capitalism, that's because they were part of this global system uh, and they were in competition, and that need for competition made them capitalists and you know that that's i think that's an accurate description of like the... structure of the uh soviet economy, but what do you do about it is the question, and and and I don't think thatskiism resolves that question. Traskism offloads the question by saying, well, you export it, you revolt everybody else, and then you can have a system where that state capitalism turns into real communism. It has to emerge independ, it has to emerge from the ground up everywhere, and that doesn't mean we can't cooperate, we have to. like things like solidarity, strikes and shit, like that historially has been the kind of thing we're talking about, i mean if in World War One, when all the countries had declared war on each other, if class consciousness had been developed enough in the advanced countries for all of their work, all of their labor class, all of their socialist parties and all of their labor unions to just declares general strikes, that would have really created world revolution right there, or could have, or it would have been the start of I think an unstoppable tide. uh or at least a highly highly uh effective the best chance we could have had basically and there's an argument to be made that World War One was basically a false flag to get the working classes of Europe to kill each other instead of unite, but the thing is once you're in that state sector and it's another country's flag coming over the uh the the wall with guns and uh and a different vocabulary. then conflict will arise, they will not accept it uh, Robespier who warned against the the the republic declaring war, and that's one of those things you can use if you want to defend Robespier is that the conditions that led to the the great terror were exacerbated wildly by the early years of the war with the first with the the Austrians uh and how badly it went and how terrified everybody was that the fucking king was going to come and uh or that uh the king was to come back to power and everybody killed, but that war was uh, that war was opposed by the Jacobns, that war was opposed by the mountain, because Robespear said the only thing people hate more than missionaries are armed missionaries and what happened was is that that frenzied war condition is what led to people fleeing to the you know the the safety of the jacabans to like carry them through the conflict and all the sister republics that were left in the wake of uh French revolutionary success were never able to take root even with national organic political movements. Think about the uh the the Italian peasontry who rose up against the French because the local priests told them to, your your your peasontry has to get alienated against the priest themselves, you cannot alienate a peasantry from their own priesthood from outside, because why the hell would they listen to you over their fucking priest? because I mean maybe maybe the crown heads of Europe looked around and said, oh in a few years these guys at any d, at any moment, forget having to stop a war, at any moment can just put down their tools and we're done, what, what if we fight each other, and these guys all writing letters to each other because they were all literally related, kaiser Wilhelm writing during the war to Nicholas and calling him uh dearest Nikki, he was fucking he was, he was, I believe, Wilhelm was also uh Queen Victoria's... grandson and king uh, king George the 5th looked exactly like Nicholas the II, exactly uh, you know, you look think of it, and the thing is is that I don't think that that's the thing that they thought to do, they weren't like, hey, let's do a big false flag war to kill off the working class, I think that one of the drivers of... of the military mobilization around late imperialism was the effective agitation of the working class, it drove, it exacerbated the need the the perceived need for militaristic and imperial advancement among the leadership of the of the countries and also militated against deescalation because from the perspective of a country dealing with a rising and more effective working class, the idea of conscripting millions of them into the military is a contributing variable towards making the decision to go to war. well, I hope I hope I made sense today, I kind of went off there, time stopped moving. Cuba is more based than Vietnam because Vietnam is basically China Junior and that they let in western capital, they've managed it relatively well, I mean their covid response shows that they have not sacrificed social cohesion uh and like a social welfare completely, which I think wouldn't have happened if they hadn't won the war, like if you're vietnamese, I think if you're if you're if you're a guy fought in that war, I think you can look back at all that sacrifice, and I don't think you can look at the McDonald's across the street and go, you know what, it was all for nothing, because if the south had won, certainly if they had been able to, take over the whole country, or but if they had been able to like dominate lower, the lower half of that peninsula, they would have become a bangladeshi, like a place of hyper exploitation of labor, whereas they have capitalism now, but it's one that still has a degree of control. but at the same time you look at that compared to Cuba holding out against the world market for fucking 70 years surviving the fall of the Soviet Union and then surviving the death of Castro which nobody really thought was going to happen. It's astounding. It really does bring a tear to the eye. I don't want to choose. Solidarity with both of them. I do wonder if like the people who are really pro chi'. like the campus dang people if they know how little the vietnamese communists like China or the most in India for that for that matter. He has striking's illegal in Vietnam that's... so funny, yeah, I mean, the person you really have to ask if it was worth Vietnam was us, for us, it was like not worth it for any kind of perspective, cuz we got in there anyway. on terms that even if they weren't ideal were better than nothing and have been wildly helpful to uh facilitating global capital flows, which of course is all of this matters, the flow, if there's one word, when you think about the economy, all this shit, just think of the word flow, they are not discrete economies in this world, it is one holistic system of systems and it is described, its actions are described as a flow in my mind, it is a circulation, it is circular system and they're in the flow, I think that they are at a better position as a country than they would have been uh if they hadn't fought and hadn't kicked us out uh, but certainly when you consider what the stakes were for America and how psychially damaging that war was for us and how it deformed our politics for the rest of its existence, it's kind of breathtaking, but of course. an example had to be made like it was in Indonesia, like it was in Iran, like it was in Guatemala, like it was in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Greece, Italy, France, uh, Ireland, if you count all the the aid to the fucking uh, the SAS against the anti-imperial movements, it's uh, it was a... like you could say you could call it the third world war, i think they said that on and sorry, i think i think mike judge said that on true and on that it's that the third world war already happened and it was the battle between capitalism and the whole world like not just the soviet union but like array differently like all of the world and like you could consider the soviets and like the chinese is big factions within a broader uncoordinated coalition against one massive enemy, which is global capitalism, and that the battlefields were not in Russia or the United States, but in Korea, Vietnam, uh, uh, the DRC, South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique, Algeria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, all all the for all the Europe itself through the gladio program, Algeria. uh the entire the entire western hemisphere, the entire American sphere of influence, and I'm not talking about, and in all those cases, I'm talking about real violence, actual battlefields, deaths in the millions and the end of which has left a rampant and un and unchallenged global capitalism, with a global capital flow, and so I was say that from the point of view of like American policy makers and American, American stakeholders, specifically American political stakeholders, Vietnam was a mistake, even if it did prevent an example from forging, but I think as stepped away as like one chess move in a global chess game uh in the in the in the in the interest of the creation of those flow networks, like if you don't have. what like it's a reverse domino theory, if you don't go in in vietnam, where else don't you go in, and what battles maybe do you lose, and then how much does that change the uh conditions? Hussites uh bad timing, you got to wait man, you got to wait for that printing press, what are you doing, all right guys, maybe one more question, I'm gonna. I'm going to wrap it up, I'm a little, I'm a little smoked, oh man, Twilight struggle, okay, I will leave on this, thank you for reminding of that, I tried to play Twilight struggle once, and it seems to me to be a very, very complicated game, but that's exactly the kind of game that Chris could walk me through. so lot, i would love to do twilight struggle, that's a great idea, we'll do that, and i hope, i hope the stream is going to start in september, fingers crossed, i think we're going to do it, and like i said, there'll still be an hour whenever we do it, there will be an hour of me doing this, that's not going anywhere, maybe Chris will help with fielding the question so I'm not staring into the screen so much, but I will basically be doing this, then we'll do games and other stuff, but this is not going anywhere, it's being added to, bengazi ain't going away. All right guys, good night.
