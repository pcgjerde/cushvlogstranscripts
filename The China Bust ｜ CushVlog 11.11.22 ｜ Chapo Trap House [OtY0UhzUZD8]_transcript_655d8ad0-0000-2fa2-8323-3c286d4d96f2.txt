 Busted flat and batting ruge, waiting for a train, I was feeling just as faded as my jeans, bobby thumb the diesel down, just before it rain, road us all the way. I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana, I was playing softwaby saying the blue, yeah, windshield wiper, slapping Thomas holding Bobby's hand in mine, we sang every song that driving new, bream's just another word for another left to lose, nothing, that mean nothing honey. it ain't free, yeah, yeah, our feeling good was easy, when he sang the blues, yeah, feeling good was good enough for me, it was good enough for me, my bob and agall, from the contact to the california son, bob is saying the secrets of my soul. for all kinds of weather, there everything that we done, your bobby baby, he check me from the co-old, one day out near selenas now, i let him slip away, but he was looking for that home and i hope he finds it, cuz i trade up my tomorrow's for one single yesterday to beholding baby's body next to mine, how do i sound? is it roboty again or is it normal? please tell me, i mean i'm not going to be able to do anything up for it, i guess it doesn't matter. okay, good, i'm glad, i apologize for the robot sound last night, i hope it made sense anyway. all right, cool, i'm glad everyone could listen to it. so We're starting our China book, a tiny little China book, little China guy, little bitty China guy today, a little fun little tiny china, China man, a little Marzapan called uh, the China boom, honestly it should be the China boom question mark, because uh, they're not too down with, he's not too down, the author Huafen Wang not down with the thesis that the chinese uh are representing some... alternative to the global capitalist order or some inheritor of it, he lays out in the intro that the thesis of the book will be that China is one capitalist state among the other capitalist states in the world uh system and that it is dependent upon the United States and it's uh and the American headquartered global order for its coherence and and statement so we'll see, we'll see if he's right and we can talk about it, I might, if anybody has a book that like wants to make the argument, the China is something different and like does uh represent a a a phase shift to change, I'd be willing to hear it, but that's not what we're getting out of this book, and I have to say, having read the first half, you know, it's obviously very breezy and uh and uh general, but it does pain. strong picture uh and part of the reason he does that he do that is because one thing that won me over to the book very early so in chapter one a mark a market without capitalism 1650 to 1850 where he talks about basically the uh the ching dynasty the king dynasty is ching dynasty the ching dynasty the the manchoes the last dynasty of China uh the one that was in power during that big uh the great diversions uh between Europe and uh the rest of the world but als so specifically China and right off the bat uh hang is asking the question, why did uh capitalism not emerge in China? and to answer that question, he brings to brings to bear a lot of the uh tools, thinkers that I have been really influenced by in the last few years, so I was like, okay, he's uh correct, he knows. talking about uh carry on uh because the first chapter is uh basically answers that question why does do we find China having to become a capitalist country in the late? 20th century and not you know the same time that England was becoming one and uh the answer that is sketched out in this chapter is that while you still you had thriving markets and you had a thriving uh uh trade and merchant economy with manufacturing too with like workers like you had all the stuff that you saw in Europe the stuff that got turned into in Europe capitalism but it was not ever coordinated into a... is is that there was a interventionist paternalist imperial over sovereign a there was you had localized like commercial networks. uh that could never uh take over the regulatory power of the state, the way that the capitalist could do it Europe because there was this overarching authority, the empire, which was able to, for one thing, was able to intervene in conflicts between workers and employers in favor of workers, which increased the cost of uh investing in capitalist industry, which disincentizes investment in capitalist. industry, now the reason they're able to do that is because of their robust bureaucratic capacity, the imperial uh bureaucracy, which is a centrally administered uh uh system to administer the state, which has tendrals everywhere and is made up of people who passed the famous imperial exams, we know that it was a failure to pass those exams that led uh to the typing heavenly kingdom to be uh established when somebody got a bad grade on one. so now but not but there's a there's a two sides to this bureaucratic power: one, it intervens and undermines uh capitalist interests in the in the regions where capitalism is kind of coming into being, and two, it provides somewhere for people who acquire wealth in merchants, in merchants that uh, in merchant investments, uh, it it gives them a better. option to send their kids and to spend their money, because there was so much money associated, so many uh, so much advancement, so much socials uh, social credit, social distinction and so much like actual cash in the imperial bureaucracy, that merchant families instead of becoming you know long-term, dynamic like banking families, like your... fucking medichis and your roth childs in in the in the in Europe, within a few generations a lot of that merchant uh wealth gets dissipated, people spend it educating their kids so that they can become high-ranking civil servants, which is a different, this sort of phenomenon is another reason that France is is a reason that France relative to England uh has a later capitalist development, because the the French practice of selling offices and making the selling of those offices uh inheritable uh gave the uh the cap the people had money in early modern France a incentive not to risk it on a speculative colonial ventures or or risky finance schemes or or or capital intensive and therefore dangerous uh industrial schemes just by offices you get a return, so this means that there is no autonomous, organized capitalist class emerging amongst all this capitalist action that's happening in the early modern period when China gets a wash in silver, basically uh the commercial economies of China and Europe were supercharged by the infusion of new world, American silver, and why is that? pure old fashion exploitation, it's all at the end of the day, it is brinding money, gold out of blood, and and it was doing that that that created this commercial revolution, but in China, there were all these things militating against the organization of autonomous merchant, merchant uh groups, but if you were, but the thing is Chinese society, just like European society, created people buy inclination and interest and ability, wanted to be capitalist, wanted to do merchant stuff. but what did they do in China? now in Europe they took over, they literally coordinated to take over control of their smaller and therefore more easily conquered medium-sized uh states as opposed to... the untouchable chinese imperial state which has so many interests within it that go beyond and contradict the interests of the merchants in the cities, they have to fucking worry about the peasants having a fucking revolt every 300 years an chinese empire uh people start starving, they do a revolution and then they put in a new fucking uh emperor, that's that's how you lose the mandate of heaven is getting the fucking peasants pissed off of you, what the fuck cares what some fucking merchants have to say, their influence is nothing, but the so they couldn't fight the state, some of them stayed and you know kept kept grinding and out in China, but a lot of them left and they created uh Chinese diasporic merchant colonies all through Asia uh from Taiwan to macao to uh southeast Asia and Indonesia and Manila, Philippines where they were trading with Europeans and trading with locals and it's very interesting, you see in Asia uh... a recapitulation of the sort of cycles of pagromes that happened to Jews in Europe, but against Chinese uh colonies in the rest of Asia, because the Chinese in those cities stood for what Jews stood for in the European uh context, um, the merchant class, the people who held your fucking uh bank note, the pawn brokers, the people who in a burgening merchant society uh are on the top, have the have the upper hand in these in this new marketized world that peasants and recent peasant arrivals to cities can't compete with and they get pissed when things go bad and they go and they beat people up and of course they think it's fucking they think it's buse they're chinese just like Europeans thought it's buse they're Jewish but no it is an expression it's a folk expression of alienation and fear at being imiserated in this new way in a way that you can't fight against but there's nowhere to fight it's a mystery it's a phantom it is not it's it's a it's It's a ghost, so you can only take it out on people, but anyway, this means that China just kind of stagnates there, and it doesn't really get forced to try to do modernity until the European gun ships show up uh and basically force them into the new trade economy. so that's the first chapter that going through that history and I really like it because it echoes a lot of the stuff I've been saying so I love being affirmed yes I'm correct thank you but I I this is why I love the shidle book so much by the way I keep talking about the wolf the Walter Shedle book and of Rome because the thing that gets you as a kid is the fact that when you do the Y thing with an adult you get to the point where everybody just kind of puts their hands up and that's true of so many at to explain historical phenomena and sociological phenomena, you just sort of have to shrug at a certain point, but with the shidle thesis, you get to answer a question that has a definitive answer and that does not beg another question, because with with description here of the Chinese imperial state intervening to prevent capitalism from emerging, why would they do that? the answer he gives is because of the paternalistic ethics that mass the material interest. in maintaining stability, the emperor wants to maintain stability, and capitalism, capitalist action, capitalist uh, behavior is destabilizing inherently, so of course he wants to stop it, the reason Europe got capitalism is because no sovereign existed who could impose that will from that from that position, you had these small to medium size statements, which could be: taken over effectively by their bourgeois, because everybody was trying to get money to fight wars with each other, they had wars to fight with each other, if they lost the wars they would lose their dynasty, and so they empowered these merchants and these financieers in order to fuel their war machines, and that means they give over their own sovereignty, because the the buse that long-term sacrifice uh in their minds is better than in the short. term being dispossessed by losing an existential war with one of your other European rivals and of course all of that is you know being fueled by class conflict at the base like you have to fight and conquer because you have no stable center in a class society but shidle goes further because you can say well why did they have a why did they have a fucking empire and the Europeans have a bunch of warring statelets a bunch of people have had explanations about culture about language about religion but shedl says because cannot do because of the necessity, necessity of a division of labor and will roll over you if you do not fully mobilize against that uh threat and there's and then you say, well why did they have to worry about that, and the Europeans didn't? the answer to that, because that is where the step is, and you're done, there's no ways the step there, right? the step's there, because that's where the step is, we're done. That's why I love the shitle thesis because it gets you to literal bedrock. So you got this dying Ching dynasty that's being racked by internal conflict. There's they have this balancing act between the the the the rural land owning gentry, the uh imperial. uh uh bureaucracy, the uh local authorities and local magnates of the various uh traders and industries and then the fucking peasantry who were for the most part free tenants, they pay they had they owed money to a landlord but that's it, the feudal arrangements had been smashed uh uh thousands of years ago uh but what that meant of course is over time uh there's a... session at the bottom, you get people shaken out of ownership, and specifically the people who moved from northern China to southern China, the hakka, they move from northern China, desolate, prone to attack by step nomads, to the more uh rich lands of the south where they have no stake, where they have no uh property, and because they're starting from the bottom have a difficult time acquiring any, so you've got this. restive population fight uh, you got this constant class conflict in the countryside caused by this sort of friction between the landless uh uh farm laborers, peasants and uh and land owners, and now you've got the west showing up, hey you guys got to buy our opium or else we're going to blow you up buse you otherwise you have you've been taking all the silver we have we need to rebalance the third trade we need to make you buy this opium because we know people will smoke it uh and right after that you have the fucking taiping rebellion it's this collapse and so there's this frantic effort after the tienger are put down uh to like china like Japan did at the same time modernize but all you're really doing is empowering these regional military powers these warlords who had been empowered to defeat the taiping and then after the war become centers of regional power that are able to grab all that surplus that's being organized now that's being rationalized and put it towards their little military feefdom which is not creating the dynamic commercial economy that you would need to compete with the west. like it's interesting so when the uh when the Ming dynasty collapses in the mid 1600s during the same little ice age uhological crisis that caused 30 years more in Europe uh and um uh several ottoman sultans being uh overthrown in a very short period of time uh they lost the mandate of heaven for the same reason that all those other forces did uh and there was as it happened historically a bandit king a disaffected postman uh who got fired and then went the hills and became a a bandit king let a huge host at their way to the capital, that it happened historically, that was how that was the cycle of Chinese history, but this time uh one of the generals of the of the Ming, who's guarding the gate of the fucking uh great wall, to keep out one specific step nomatic group, the man the manchoes, convites them through the gate with the provisor that they would help him, restore the main, so that last dynast to overthrous. gets about a year in power before the manchos roll up and then once they get in there they realize oh this machine has completely rotted away we can just take it over and then so there's this violent bloody uh uh prolonged war uh between the remnants of the Ming and the the Manchu and they eventually take over through their military basically the contractors they hired and at the end of the manchou when the Typing have taken over the most productive lands between the yellow and yang see re like they take it over the heart the middle of the middle kingdom uh the the uh manchoes held on because of western military intervention on behalf of them because they wanted somebody that they knew that they could deal with, rather than rather than some weird millenniary freak white decide to you know do communism or something uh and also the empowerment of these local military leaders who are given a ability to uh grab surplus to create a machine that can take down the typing and once it does these are new nodes of power that was so that by the time the republican revolution happens 1911 believe uh they're basically uh Sanya Sen and his buddies are just taking over an empty there they're they're storming an empty palace the power is out in these warlord areas and so that leads to this slow steady consolidation as the nationalists and the communists alied largely because of Stalin's insistence uh roll up through these these warlord feiefdoms and uh suborn them to a central authority. This is the second chapter primitive accumulation that we're on now uh and of course eventually the uh the nationalist betray the communist the uh this they're destroyed in the cities uh and part because of a very uh ill-advised strike, general strike attempted in Shanghai, once again the insistance of Stalin that gets massacred and leads to the the party sort of rearranging itself where among what social base, the base that has historically overthrown uh uh empires that had lost the mandate of heaven, the dispossessed land, the dispossessed landless hocker peasantry of the south. but the nationalists can't hold power, they the chinese, the Japanese invade, Japanese are defeated, the Chinese nationalists are kicked off of the mainland, and you have now finally, sort of, I would I can sort of considered the completion of the Tiping rebellion, which is the victory of the Chinese communist party, because what it is, is it is the it is the modern challenge to the... just the the the specific regime of the ching dynasty, but of the notion of dynastic politics as it had as it had been understood and the assertion of a nationalist, a national, a modern national concept that of course because it's reacting to sort of a staltified social order has to involve a a ideological um structure that is from that is imported from ab of abroad, it has to be imported from abroad, because capitalism is being imported from abroad, the fucking opium, those the the cape the trunks of opium getting unloaded in in Shanghai and fucking Hong Kong, uh, that was capitalism was showing up and so a new China had to respond to this, and that that had to be a Chinese response, and so first it's the guys of Christianity uh, and then uh marxism, which of course. one is the continuation of the other, the attempt to find a human heart in the social and economic machine that we're living in. so when the when the chinese or the communist take power, they are now locked in a new world created by the the the world, the the the internationalization of capitalism. we have now reproduced the medium state competitive framework that had dominated Europe and it led to the uh rise of capitalism, we have exported it to the world, now everybody is a fucking medium sized state, fighting with every other state for existential survival, which is the survival of the specific regime of power, and so what do you do, you have to build your productive forces, and how do you do that, the same way everyone does it, there's only one way to do it, there's no weird trick to defeat this. It is mass exploitation and domination of peasantry, it is taking people who work the land and making them work harder, as we said, as I've said before, like farmers only work as hard as I have to, because it sucks to do, it's it's it's it's tiring work, you wouldn't work harder than you had to, so you work to sustain yourself, that's not enough to create the surpluses that you can direct to investment and make. modern technological capitalism possible, allow you to compete with the other states, so that is why the Russians had did what they did, that's why the the famins and then activization, the Chinese did the same thing, the great leap forward, first they tried to export industry to and make it a small scale in the countryside, because that's where people lived, they tried to not uproot them, they're going to have people smelting pig iron in their backyards, like next to the barn, and of course that was absurd, because the whole reason the that that industrial capitalism works is that it brings together capital that it concentrates, just like it concentrates surplus. it does not distribute it, it's job is to bring it into a center, like you're doing the opposite, and that helped lead to 30 million people dying, which is exactly what they needed, they needed to to free up that goddamn land, you cannot have a change in a mode of production without some drastic change in the relationship between the people and the land. uh, feudalism was in terminal decline, or is in terminal. stagnation uh when the first flag ships showed up from uh in Venice or whatever um there was too many people on too little land it had lost there was no longer the the land was losing its facundity it was producing less with more work it's it's the downward spiral and there is no way to break it up then the black death comes people start being able to move people can negotiate different deals with land owners and specifically they can move with the cities and then that urbanization that starts that sets off the cascade of reactions by different elites that lead to the specific bring together of different innovations in a specific place that is then exported elsewhere and here's of course the real joke, all the horrors that are put a communism's doorstep, the millions killed by communism, so that is the price not of communism but of... sophistication of your machinery. now the reason that capitalism gets off the hook is because all of their... famins, all of their repressions happened to people who don't count to be part of the polity, like uh, i was listening to one of the wrap-up uh episodes of Mike Duncan's revolutions podcast about revolutions and he's or no, it was one of the last ones about the Soviet Union and he's looking back at collectivization and he says like the Soviets did this amazing thing of creating out of a medieval backwater a modern industrial economy in like 20 years that is revolutionary and wild. and then he says, but when you look at uh, the horror that that required, and then you look at like the way that England, for example, industrialized uh, there's so much less violence and horror, you know, there's other ways to do it, no, he has forgetting that that violence and horror all happened, it just all happened in India, it happened to Indians, and not just this, and by the way, not just the deaths from uh, from famin, but also all the deaths from repression, all the all the goolog shit, all the all the uh arbitrary detentions and executions, that is the reality of colonial administration, but because it happened to this other, the process at the center gets off the hook, i mean that's how it say allowed to go that long, because it displaces the horror, we would not countenance the horror, what allows us to count since the horror, in this case was distance, but in the 20th century is the... creation of an actual living faith, communism that can activate behavior, we have to do this, and by many measures they all did, the soviets were in a situation where they had no other option, the reason that a fucking thug, the reason a gang leader, a criminal, and not some sort of soviet like worker, intellectual took power, is because the thug was the only one who had the stomach to do, to the stomach to embody what was going to have to happen if the Soviet Union was going to... survive now there were people who said maybe don't let the soviet union survive uh like bukaren buy off the peasants and uh and and get us off the train to uh modernity and I got to say that might have been the right move, I kind of think it was the right move, but that would have meant the dispossession of the soviet uh ruling class, the the party, and they didn't want to do that, who wants to give up their power, and it not even because of selfish reasons, because you don't trust anybody else to have the vision or faith uh to... do it right, so like the horrors of crick, the black book of communism is: just one chapter in the black book of modernity, the black book of cap, the greater black book of capitalism, because everybody is forced once capitalism is capitalism is established to adapt, and that is why the bolsheviks all banked on a world revolution, so that they wouldn't everyone wouldn't have to fucking do what had already been done in terms of horrible brutal exploitation, that you could slow the pace at the center, slow the pace of accumulation and then redistribute. uh uh power to modernize at like a retail speed rather than at the wholesale butchery demanded by capitalism, but if you're one state among many, whether you the Soviet Union or miles China, you are a capitalist state, because you have to respond to capitalist incentives in the world market. I don't how you can argue against that honestly. So they had, so they industrialized on the back of the peasantry. 30 million died in the 50s, but then what's this in the 60's? thanks to a huge program of rural development and the and uh, a uh rural healthcare and literacy system, all of a sudden education rates, literacy rates, uh, uh, life expectancy. quality of life in the pesant in the rural, excuse me, in the rural areas goes up, they were able to actually direct that surplus, yes it killed 30 million people, but it didn't just go into capitalist pockets, willy the way it does when it happened in India, that's the difference between India and China at the end of the day, is the had Leninn or they had ma just like Russia had Lenin and they had Gandhi. so what this gave them is this ability to invest infrastructure, ports, factories, like uh uh uh power capacity that gives them the ability to to do the things you need you know to offspin economic activity from from a center of dynamism. and even extend some of that to the rural communes uh, because they did do full collectivization in the countryside as they had in Russia, because that's what you got to do, you don't think they did that in India, it wasn't collectivization, they didn't put them on, but what they did is they said, hey your old system of handicraft uh uh uh like production uh and your system of like cyclical uh provision of like cyclical storage of surplus for future use to mitigate against changing conditions becuse those those those famines in India are cyclical, there is cyclical drought everywhere, but historical uh peasant life, peasant subsistance lifestyles of the Indians had allowed for the creation of like surplus to be reserved, so when there was... the the raj forced Indians into a market relationship that meant that there was no more fucking place to put any uh surplus but on the market and so you say oh my god they're horrible that's horrible they did it on on the backs of the peasantry well you know what that means though they didn't have to borrow money to do it they didn't have to borrow a bunch of fucking foreign money to do it which is what everybody else was doing during this 60s and 70s and including in the fucking like the eastern block uh uh Poland had something like 44% of their GDP was debt uh by the time of the uh the uh the Volker shock because you had first the petro dollar flush of the 70s when all of a sudden the oil boom means there's all this petrol money that it's not staying in the saudi the saudis aren't keeping it they're putting it back out there so it goes into bank accounts and it gets lent back out. at a certain rate of interest and it got lent back out to all these countries that were trying to borrow their way to a development rather than do the do to their pasentry and either because their structures well one way or another because their structures wouldn't allow them to do it, so they borrowed a ton of money, but what that means is that when Volker shot comes in and these economies start collapsing and and uh pressure on the Soviet block becomes unbearable, China has largely avoided that trap. They don't have to do the shock therapy. And so that starts in 1980. they have this capacity that they don't have to give away, they don't have to give off to, they don't have to sell off, which is essentially what happens everywhere else, all those state assets get sold off in the soviet union and in all those formerly developmentalist states uh, those those former inst import substitution regimes in Latin America and in Africa, boom, overnight that stuff becomes property of international finance capital, all that all that capacity that they built up during the cold war, except China, China gets to keep theirs. and that means that they now have a chance to direct their own response to this new uh economic conditions as a and this new their news uh status as like a competitor on the global stage and you could argue that all those deaths were worth it and you could also say that that's monstrous and that nothing can be thought of in those terms but the reality is nobody was doing it with the goal of killing all those people, they were doing it with the goal of trying to build communism, and you could say no, you're just building capitalism, but everybody was doing that, there is the there is the uh wiring that were like there is the incentive structure that's that determines our behavior, and then there is our imagined story we tell ourselves about why we're doing things, and those things are not the same and there is conflict between them, and if the conflict between those things is politics, is us working. through like, oh, like, what do we have to do, and then how do we go about doing it, because we think we are, and that's always being done, and the tragedy of the com capitalist system is that it allows people to act out of real, earnest desire to do the good thing, but end up reinscribing the worst thing you could do. all right, so the last chapter. is the capitalist boom, 1980 to 2008, so this is when they do the the Deng Xiaoping, who lo had his number at first, like he was, he was denounced and fell from power during the cultural revolution, he was purged as a rightist, but he was allowed to uh, he was rehabilitated because uh, once the the uh culture revolution ends, once that energy is uh sputters out the legitimate. of the regime is completely thread bear, the only thing that's going to keep people uh on board is rising living conditions, not the iron rice ball, which was the guaranteed social welfare contract that had characterized mowas china, the iron rice ball, it was guarantee of uh of uh housing, education, healthcare, food, now it wasn't always going to be good or a lot of food or... or uh good housing, but it was guaranteed, but that's in this in the new world, in the new commercialized world, in the new collected wired world with televisions and blue jeans, you can't run on, you can't run an regime on revolutionary austerity, you took that as far as it could go, the thing cracked and then you had to rebuild, so you have to give people a consumer horizon to replace that extinguished political one, and that is what they started doing. in the 80s, first thing they did was they break up the peasant communes, but but very importantly what they don't do is they don't change the system, the household registration system that China uses to uh arbitrage uh labor cost basically, because in China you are, your access to social goods is predicated on your place of birth, that is can be waved, like right now there's tons of landless workers who moved to... cities, but because they moved, they don't have those access to those rights, basically, and that makes them more vulnerable, makes you makes them uh more willing to work for less money, so you get the rise of these state-owned enterprises which become these regional centers of power, because the center sort of disintegrates during this period, the power at the center of the the PMC, is prc is replaced by these regional parties, and they're getting more and more uh discretion over what to do with the money because it's an experimental time, the the local regions are, it's it's it's it's the it's it is the the degree of which guys like shumpider and hayak are correct is really shown in the way that they did this, the way this came about, there was a florescence of state money from state banks going to uh uh state-owned enterprises in regions which were controlled by local party elites and bureaucrats, and and they become these local power centers that are taking on all of this uh cheap loans that they never pay back and this causes a uh a problem in the 90s uh and eventually the rise of mega companies, so out of these sort of regional boom bus cyclers, these you know, you could you could compare them to uh, Andrew Jackson's pet banks in the United States, like if you can imagine them building capitalism in in in the 1980s and 90s the way that capitalism was built in our early American period, like the 1820s, 1830s, you have these these pet banks, that are eventually consolidated, and one of the examples that he uses in the book is that there were this, there was for a long time in China a patchwork of telephone companies and mobile companies that provided uh, the provided uh telecommunications and what happened is they all got brought together and under one name, Chinamobile, which sold a portion of its uh ownership on the stock market, became a stock that is owned by private companies and it becomes funded by uh foreign money, the majority shares held, that's that's the key to this entire structures that all these industies, the majority share of ownership is held by the state, but there is a minority share of the state of the of these companies that is owned by a private company corporation. which is how privatization happened in the rest of the world, but here it is managed and sort of uh controlled by a sovereign party, as opposed to the way that the firesale destruction of communism in the the east, eastern eastern Europe uh was met with just the collapse of any ability to prevent anything from getting privatized. see some more of this stuff, so when they get rid of the iron rice bowl, they increase the ab, your ability to to make money in these private enterprises or these these public enterprises that are paying out like money to people within it and become you know patriages networks uh, so people are making more money, but whenever you get rid of that floor, people start falling through it, and so you have an increase in unemploy. and increase of uh uh uh of social dislocation. a lot of these state of enterprises because they aren't making money for uh start shedding employers or employees start firing people uh and this all leads to a a anti-government movement that culminates at TNMN that gets misunderstood uh in the west, but it's described square is described as the student uprising. of young people who wanted democracy, and there were plenty of young people in uh, from the better families of the party who were in the universities uh, and who wanted greater democratic uh accountability, because in their mind, they they buse like buse, the liberalization process is this double edge sword, right? it's it's providing more opportunity, it's providing more uh a race standard of living for one group of people, well it is, there's another group of people who are falling. through the cracks, they're getting fired, they're losing access to healthcare, uh, housing, and they are represented in different social circles, there are fewer of those second group of people in colleges, so for uh, when they saw the the China around them in distress, the students said, oh, this liberalization of the economy is good, it's working, we need a concomminant liberalization of our political system, but they weren't the only people at Tentamen. there were people from the working class who were trying to fight on behalf of that iron rice b and on behalf of Chinese socialism and meanwhile array against them you had a divided what had been a divided uh politic bur and a divided Chinese communist party he was divided between the reformists like Zhang who were pushing heavy for economic reform. and then the hardliners hated that, but it turn, but the thing about those hardliners is there are a lot of them were in the army, and what they really want, the reason that they wanted uh, they didn't want to get rid of the old state managed economy, the didn't have anything to do with like liberating the people, it's buse they it's part of their power, their conception of control and power, these are the military figures of the regime, they want to run people over, they want to dominate, and power, not because they think it's going to do anything, they can imagine it's for the national purpose, but again that's just conflated with their best interest as the people in charge, and it's self-interested in both ways, it's self-interested, because the a ruling class is always self-interested, and so they were in conflict over the uh over the over liberalization, but ping and the reforms like, okay, crush these people, because what if we do get, the the the dumb ass libs think, if we get more democracy in China, then we're going to get more liberalization, the implicat, the real implication of more democracy in China in the conditions of neoliberal reform is you might get people insisting on actual communism, might get people insisting on doing socialism for once, of course the the students, some of them understood that and agreed with it, other ones just couldn't conceive of that because they'd only seen the... side of uh of the economic liberalization, but both sides of the ruling elite could agree, crush these fucking kids, because it would give them control, and so the deal that was made after Tiana Man was, the hardliners get keep control of the the uh political structure and the party, and the uh liberalization continues and this goes in the face of everything the dumb ass liberals it. the western liberals who insisted, no, no, no, when you give them a little bit of democracy, or you give them some liberalization, they will do democracy, they eastern Europe did fake democracy, fake boujo, democracy after they collapsed, China never collapsed, it's able to do something that the other post-colonial powers countries couldn't do, we were enforced first at the barrel of gun and then IMF loans and american interest rate. to privatize their economies, so now you have a situation where the party leader, the party middle class, they don't want fucking liberalization of of the of politics because they these fucking people might vote themselves socialism and we can't have that. so the economy, so the Chinese economy in the 90s becomes this uh collection of little feudal fiftoms of little patriages networks around families, which is how feudalism worked, and that is how the uh state enterprise economy of China worked in the 90s and auts. you can argue that chairman J has tried. to break that up or whatever, i don't know, i don't think you really talk, i think this book's a little old, so i might not talk about that, but uh, we can talk about it, whoever has more information, i don't know that much about which zg is up to, but that has been like the conditions of of what's happened is that these local regional state-owned enterprises that have foreign capital but are still controlled by boards, are able to dispense profits, are able to dispense surplus, but the thing that really energized the chinese economy as we of course know is they're exporting. and that was made by a couple things coming together, one the Chinese devaluing of their currency, so that it would be have a favorable trade status in the uh on the global market, and then taking all of these healthy, educated sort of uh uh or - i don't want to use the word civilized, but i guess in some way like uh urbanized through media or whatever, this new integrated peasant. working uh a pesant labor force and then byg and this isn't anything you probably had to plan, because they're sending so much money to the cities, they're putting so much money into investing in this infrastructure for these industries, they are by definition putting relatively less money in the countryside, so there's rural underdevelopment in the 80s and 90s, so you have deteriorating conditions in the countryside, harder to make money out there. you have this new concentration of foreign and domestic capital in the cities and it pulls people into them, but because of the household registration system, they're put into a legal limbo by moving to cities, which makes them gives them the same uh uh precarious negotiating position that uh immigrants do in the United States and the US Mexico border is the same thing as the household registration thing is in China. It is an artificial fantasy. line put somewhere by capital by the states that are administering capital and are administered by it in term uh to arbitrage labor costs, to make it so that instead of having to spend more money on more uh mechanization, like that's the the the capitalist death spiral that marks and visioned is that it gets so it costs too much over time or competition gets you to the point where you're investing so much in your capital that you get to a technological tipping point when there's no more labor going into it and the whole thing breaks down but what stops that from happening is keeping wages lower in the center so that you can uh use that that exploitation that surplus you're getting from that labor that which is all surplus as opposed to the labor you get out of the machine which is just the labor really you put into the machine actually less than the amount you put into the machine because of fucking thermodynamics that live human labor that's surplus you get to fucking you get to live off it but only if there's an permanent uh external flatterner on wages and that is the state saying oh you should be here, so that's this big pool of educated, civilized uh rural labor, the new concentrations of capital, the special enterprise zones on the coast, boom, it explodes, uh, and it gets interconnected to the global economy so that it becomes this new... uh, not even manufacturer, it becomes the assembler of the world, because there'd been a while China was in the process of restructuring its economy, there is the Asian tigers that merged, all of whom were the beneficiaries of cold war us, larges and support while they created sort of protected local uh uh uh wig style domestic industries, because that's the thing. "if capitalist shows up with a fire hose and you are an undeveloped country, they will prevent you from developing, because it will always be more be more profitable for them to just extract your cheap roll commodities, it will never be more profitable compared to that in terms of return on investment for them, as opposed to people in the country who actually get the benefits, to industrialize it, you have to have during the cold war, you had to have uncle Sam's hand on your shoulder saying, it's okay, you can, you can industrialize. we even did that for the British to an extent, we we we fucking floated their currency way above what it deserved to be, because they were England, you know, and we didn't want their feelings were hurt or whatever, and because of the the the the achison's freeecrescent theory of of of uh containing communism through Asia and into the middle east among producers and extraction, extractors, like organs of this greater American. uh industrial machine, china, China develops industries, those industries get more developed, before you get to the tipping point where you've overproduced, the uh less intensive, less uh capital intensive industries get exported, so you had something they called the the the flying geese formation of europe of of asian economies, so you had Japan, south korea, Taiwan, uh, Saigan, and uh, Hong Kong. and production of different stuff for American consumption was spread amongst them, the highest tech stuff in Japan, second highest in Korea and Taiwan, and then the uh the the the least developed, but the lowest capital uh production in uh the Singapore, in Thailand. What China does, at the turn of the century, once it's phenled most favored nation status. and entry into the WTO uh is to break all that up and to do all that manufacturing in China, taking every one of those steps and doing it in China. You can't do that in those countries under those capitalist conditions because they cannot organize enough to prevent over accumulation and crisis. China can do that and it even stable buse that could have led to a collapse of the Asian economy because what are these countries supposed to do now that they can't manufacture this stuff if China's going to produce it all, but instead what happens to stabilize it and reorient the uh the manufacturing economy of uh Asia away from Japan as American proxy to China is by having China be the place where stuff produced and all those other Asian uh industrial economies is assembled, brought together and then finally shipped to the United States. so that's the economy that we are now talking about, that's the economy that is being posited as an alternative to global capitalism a challenge uh something else and uh the second half of the book is his uh answer to the question like is China gonna going to take this boom and turn it into agemoneny and uh I think from reading the preface his answer is going to be no uh and we'll see exactly why he well he lays it out next week. Oh that was almost an hour perfectly wow nice nice and uh disciplined. so the title of the book is the china boom by fuck's his name, i always forget his name, uh, hofung hung, that's it, so part two is global effects, coming demise, so that might be a spoiler alert there, it's been very nice, it was raining like crazy here in la for a while, which is was very weird uh, but now it's nice and sunny again, it's crisp, it's fall, I didn't think I could get that anymore, I thought I was done, I thought I never had never, I'd never have another crisp fall again. I might if somebody has one if somebody has a book that like is saying hey China China's fresh and it's and they're doing something different I'd like to hear it because I I mean I like I said I'm new to it and I haven't studied that much but I mean from what from what China looks to be doing from the outside, it appears to be a country that adapted to become a modern capitalist state and is now adapting as we're all doing, it's not, it's not doing anything other than reacting, which is all we can ever do, we're always only reacting, billiard balls being knocked around, and the revolutionary fantacy is that we will break through, and I think we will, and we have the phenomenon that occurs. the question is, is China that? is it is it eruption? and uh, it doesn't seem to be. seems to be pretty content to just be a state among states uh and to see the advancement of its influence being you know the same as the uh as the as the drive of any one of these states, competing within a framework, but dependent, here's the crucial part, dependent upon that framework. So we'll see, we'll talk about it next week. All right, folks, have a good day, peace and chicken grease.
