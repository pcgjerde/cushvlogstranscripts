 look out to the chat room, we got fun and games, we got all the memes you want, but you better come here today, we got the posters that you find, whatever you may need, and if you've got your peppes, we got your disease, welcome to the chat room, welcome to the chat room, won't you bring me to you, in the memes, memes uh, so I don't want to, I'm sorry that I felt I started the stream so uh, irreverently considering the the day it is, it is after all 9:11, which is a very important date, and of course very important day for the city that I live in, my adopted home of New York. It was on this day that Hillary Clinton puked shit her pants and fell into ASUV and the world was never the same, the day of outdoor summer hoops, man, that was a moment, wasn't it, when Hillary fell over, I watched that, we we interviewed the guys that made the Pepe documentary, and I watched that. segment where they talk about how this felt like they'd memed it into reality and i got to say that's certainly how it felt at the moment, it felt like everyone, i know of course those freaks like to take things proprietarily because they suffer so much for being online as in you know their lives are so miserable outside of it that they they essentially deserve credit for creating all concepts because they spend the most time on here but sorry doesn't mean you're good at it just means your life sucks. anyway, i really feel like that was a group off group project, not even on our part uh willingly, just the idea that she was wildly ill and hiding it was just very funny, and turns out, she probably wasn't even sick because i mean honestly if you would have would you have asked yourself back then 9/11 2016, do you think Hillary will be alive in 2020? i think most people would be like, no, unless they find her. robot body, she's going to fucking conk out, but here she is, buse these people can't die, it's one of the many evocative like mythological elements of kuenon that like rings true, why are these evil people essentially immortal, and adridachrome stands in for the excess, the excess, the surplus value that they keep on to themselves, it allows them essentially. to stave off death by the uh intervention of technology, and you know it doesn't even necessarily need you, you don't even necessarily to have to have that much more than other people to live unnaturally longer than them, because you're not affected by the things that kill tons of Americans, like you have the time and money to avoid the costs of of um unhealthy eating habits or alcohol or anything else. you can offload those, you can pay to have them dealt with, instead of having the problem create more problem and more problem and and bring you into an earlier grave, and of course they don't expose themselves to the hazards of life that kill so many Americans, and they're never going to have to worry about having their lifespan shortened by excessive use of drugs, because they don't need drugs, power is their drug, and adrenachrome, the idea that there's a chemical in brains that is committed during fear and pain that can be consumed ritually and that will extend life, that speaks to the reality of life lived in the very sight of these people doing this while we're all suffering. Wood Wilson said that he was terrified of the automobile when it was introduced cuz he thought that the fact that now poor people would get to see rich people driving around in these vehicles would cause them all to spontaneously declare. themselves bolshevics and overthrow capitalism, he was genuinely afraid that the ostentatiousness of of this iron chariot whipping around and running over poor kids was going to make people so sharply aware of class distinctions that they would have overthrown the capitalism. now there we've we've seen that this country has particular uh bafflers built into it to withstand any overflow of radical radical activism. it's got it's got so many bafflers and chambers and venting ports that it's been able to disarm popular misery no matter where or how much it emerges basically since World War II. I got the sun of my eyes here, I got to move. I know it's I know I look very oh fuck, this is what I do for you people, man, I got this post here is the only thing that's stopping me from getting sun on my face, this is annoying uh... Hold on a minute, yeah, I'm sure this is a lot of fun for everybody watching me do this, I might have to go back to the gross wall that everybody hates because there's no sun here, so sorry if it looks like I'm in uh, sorry if it looks like I'm waiting to get executed with Nick Berg or something, but All right, here we go, this sort to be all right, this is fine, you get to see the freaking uh, the the what do they call those, transmission boxes, I don't, I don't understand math or engineering, cable box, transformer, I think it might be a transformer, fuse box, whatever it is, I don't know, it's... some sort of technology that keeps me from dying of exposure, so was the even talking about 9-11 something? oh, hillary falling over, yeah, that was really funny, wasn't it? she comes out wearing those glasses, it goes, i feel great, never really got better than that, there was never a funnier day than that, never more enalloyedly funny day of this whole thing than that. It's funny now that the left has gone around to thinking 9/11 was an inside job right because right after right after 911 911 truthorism was a sole province of the radical left that was it like alex and then that's why seeing Alex Jones's trajectory is interesting because he started off and the national consciousness anyway after being a an Austin goofup before that on 9:11 and becoming a conduit for left-wing uh disillusionment with the status quo channed into the narrative of Trump Bush doing 911 uh and then I feel like there was a pushback led by people like Matt taibi where they say who got called left gatekeers uh who they said look you're ignoring all the realities of power and the and the... tours of power in this country to create a passion play about these evil uh Bush people when the real the reality of American politics and geopolitics and geogrategic strategies that things like 911 are the inevitable outgrowth of American policy and are then incorporated back into American foreign policy as in our burrows it doesn't require intervention from the state and now it feels like we're back to the smart opinion being that 911 was an inside job as an expression of like a deeper awareness of the absurdly uh basically as a way to explain the failure of the left to generate any anything, like there was no real left in in 2001 in America, it had basically turned into nothing, like the the last you had um, you know, people can point to something like the battle in Seattle, but I honestly think minus 911 that would have and uh turned into a... uh, like a last gasp of something, it it didn't really build to anything, it was like that anti-globalization movement, it reached the point of like highest conflict with the state, and then because there's no higher way to go, there was more uh, there was no higher level of conflict with the state that they were capable of or willing to carry out, it dissipated uh, and so 9:11 kind of like helped build like even a self-conscious left in this country, first around being anti-war, but then within that, there was the hardcore who used 911 as a narrative to like construct a story of American malevolence that explain the horror of this thing that had happened to us, saying, no, no, I know this is awful, and it should, and it should make you mad, but don't be mad at them, be mad at the people in charge, and that's that was in the context of the Bush administration, a left-wing position, the right pretty much loved Bush, especially right after. stuff like that obama wasn't born in America, but left us believe that 911 was an inside job, and it was considered like a siniquin for that like left position uh, but it was left coming into its own, now the left has failed to achieve liftoff at a time of maximum crisis, a crisis that makes 9/11, that dwarfs 9/11, that is in the aftermath of 911, and it has like renders mine 11 in a day-to-day basis smaller and smaller in the minds of people who at one time had it. their entire identity, and so an answer has to come to why hasn't the left succeeded? why hasn't the left succeeded? considering how bad things have gone, and if things getting bad don't make people act better, then what hope do we have? that was what got us out of the depression essentially, without becoming a barbar is a total fascist country. was that was the was the effort of people uh who experienced the great depression and wanted to take control of their economic destinies and funnel that into things like sitdown strikes, wild cat strikes, massive labor organizing of the UAW and the and the CIO, the radical CIO, communist movement, the communist party, which was that its zeneth of influence and membership, organizing and and and creating locus of of of of radical power within every note of government up to including the democratic party, and now we're in a similar crisis or the beginnings of one, and there is no nothing even on the horizon of of even the ghost of those ideas, and I think people have a desire to want to explain that, and I think the idea of of inside jobbery, now of being persuasive as an as a thing that could happen hypothetically, a thing that could... realistically happen in this country, like a cadre of people within the within the government carrying off a massive attack on some citizens, staging elements of it, and in order to carry out this agenda in the middle east, if you think it's possible to do that, then the failure of the left to make any kind of inroads makes sense, it's explained within the greater umbrella of that meta explanation. now this is not me saying one way or the other what i believe anything about 911, i don't really no, I'm agnostic about it like I am with the Kennedy assassination uh, but I just think that the reason that that that that I have noticed anyway, and people could say I'm wrong about this. I feel like there's been a kind of a shift towards more credulity towards truerism than used to be considered on the left, and I think it's because it's not necessarily any evidence buse the evidence has always really been there, and I think some of it is very eyebrowsing and brow raising and incredibly persuasive, not stuff like Tower Seven, that doesn't get me, but you know the... connections between Saudi Arabia and uh and the hijackers, you know, stuff like that, and uh, the uh, like the the the the uh airline shorts, the the the the fucking amount of money that was made by people shorting airline stock that right before 911, uh, but anyway, like I'm saying, it's it's an interesting case, there's the... stuff that's very eyebrow raising about all of it uh we know that a lot of the stuff that they say is lies like they lied about I mean according to their own version of events they lied up for a long time about whether or not there had been an order to shoot down uh flight 93 or not and whether Dick Chane had issued it without any authorization from the president to do so so like that we know they lied about shit and obviously there's there's like the degree of Saudi Arabian government involvement is is at the minimal funding without with by some elements within. like how far it goes up, whether it was directed from the top of the of the Saudi family, royal family, that is not proven, but minimal, minimal, but much more likely to the point of handling, as if they were intelligence assets, and when you consider the American relationship to Saudi Arabia in terms of uh uh creating uh radical Islamic terror groups in order to subvert the first the Soviets and also secular leftist movements in inside the middle east, it raises eyebrows, like I said, but I think what changes, what shifts over time is what people's are looking for, and I think for a while people wanted to appear smart, they wanted to realize no, I i understand that this isn't about the Bushes, like after Obama gets in there and just wrecks everything and just destroys any momentum that left might have accumulated by by by by hijacking it and then and then dispersing it to the winds, they're like, no, this... just it's bigger than Bush and since it's bigger than Bush he couldn't have been the guy did 911 like he's he's just another araron boy for this this systematic uh despoilation of the planet. but now this farther into the shit and now with another crisis looming, i think people need an explanation for well why if we see this every day, why is nothing being done about it, why are we not getting farther, why are we not doing better? but like i said, i don't really spend a lot of time on, i don't spend a lot of time on it, because honestly my assessment of the situation is not much much. if it happened any way that people say or not, you know, I guess I do resist the idea that Bush was like, we're doing 911, I guess, I always am resist to that level of conspiracy conception, but I could definitely see, I could, I could accept as plausible, any number of things from it being allowed to go forward. after being discovered by the government to government making another step towards like paving the way and allowing to go at the operational level as part of a broader strategy, but it doesn't really change the way mustard tastes either way, we still know our enemies are, and we still know what mechanisms they use to control and maintain this, this illusion of consent. so I don't know, I am uh, I'm hesitant also to investigate it too much because I know I could definitely go down a rabbit hole, there's so many fascinating elements to that thing. I think there was doesn't wasn't there just recently declassified information that made explicit the degree to which there was high level knowledge of the 911 plot in the Saudi. government, oh man, the anthrax attacks, that stuff will make you screw your head on the other way around. Anthrax sent right after 911 to major media figures and politicians with this weird block lettering saying we have anthrax, death to america, allah, whatever. And it's discovered that the anthrax was 100% milled in a US government. uh biological weapons facility, specifically the one in Fort detrick Maryland, which is the the headquarters of America's chemical and biological warfare division, it's the unit 739, 731 for the contemporary America, and they never fucking found who did it, they accused a number of people, one guy they eventually kind of had to half admit that they pulled the richer jewel, but the other guy the... accused last, he kills himself, and then they essentially close the case, they go, well, this guy probably did it, I mean that's, I mean, but at the same time you're like, okay, the US government used US government anthrax to make that looks like Muslims did it, why would they do that? exactly, I don't understand it, it doesn't even make sense that's its own terms, they couldn't find some anthrax that couldn't be directly traced back to the US government. They did paperclip Japanese scientists, Japanese scientists who conducted monstrous medical experiments, not on foreign Jews like in Europe, on American Serviceman, on gi jo got brought to the United States and had their criminal records exponged in order to get the secrets of their tortures. but I have no idea about any of it, I try to, I try to spend more time thinking about the current situation, the current, the current crisis, just because there was a rabbit holes that if you're doing a greater project, I think are worth investigating, like if it's part of a greater project by know for me. I think it would end up me just burrowing farther away from legibility. Yeah, I want to uh, I want to take this opportunity now with a little lot to uh, to make a little miakolpa here uh on something that I've been saying for a while pretty confidently and then was proven wrong on recently. And that is when I said of course they're going to unxtend, they're going to extend unemployment. uh and stimulus at the end of august, at the beginning of august, of course they're going to do it, they're not crazy, and people said, look, what they they didn't do it, and yeah, you're right, but thinking about... on it, I think my error came because that question never came by itself or like my my somebody asking me about that never came as a as a question of like, hey, what do you think about unemployment when unemployment goes out in august? it was always framed as hey, what about when the shit goes down in august? what about when the wheels come off in august? and i think i subconsciously took too seriously the assumption that just because this thread bear system and this man. teatering economy got the fucking uh legs kicked out of it would result in some sort of generalized social crisis and I think because I assumed that I said well then of course they're going to uh do it because they would have to fail to recognize the necessity of it to the maintenance of the system that they were provided presiding over. It turns out they had better they're either more cut off to even not even be registering these questions and I think some of them are others of them I guess had better data than me. and knowing that there is no limit to our debasement at this point, they have nothing to worry about. Tom Tillis is running for re-election right now in North Carolina, which well a southern state is at the presidential level kind of a swing state, and it has a democratic governor, it's certainly not Alabama or Mississippi. One of his chief fucking uh advisors when told asked by a woman who had cancer about what was going to be what she could do about getting insurance so that she could treat it. uh said, well you know when I got want a fancy dress shirt and I can't afford it, I just don't buy it, and then she says, but I need insurance, and he goes, or I'll die, and he goes, well you better get it then, I mean, you said that to a constituent, anybody see ghostbusters too, you know, I'm a voter, aren't you supposed to lie to me and kiss my butt, I mean that's the minimum we're asking of these people to even look like it, remember when John, John Kennedy, that fucking... Yahoo from Louisiana when asked about more UI said about people want more money in the in the pandemic said people in hell need ice water, so maybe I think a lot of it is just they are detached from the question, but I think either because people higher above them with more influence are aware of it, or they're just soaking in reality in a way that people who are paying attention to this meta conversation aren't, and they just at a basic level understand things. they know it doesn't matter, they know that they have this thing rigged, they know that that that there's nothing we can do or will do, they it doesn't matter if they lose an election, and honestly a lot of them have rigged where they'll never lose elections now, they they they have picked their voter pool basically, they've winnowed themselves down to the ideal voter, and now they're going to be able to decide basically when or when when they or if they ever lose a fucking race, and they might lose a race one or there and it's fine, they still have their position. of power and they can keep it keep and hey, maybe even if they lose this time they can come back stronger, well watching the democrats fail to do anything, so the fact, and i'd say that right now it's happening here where with a election in November and neither party stepping up to offer any kind of broad uh uh redistributed demand or some sort of insistence on massive stimulus at the demand level, in the form of money to people, the fact that neither party has wrapped themselves around that, like obviously they both say they're in favor of it, but then it's all just this procedural shit, nobody is out there, bidenshure shit isn't out there, and Trump isn't out there with any kind of demand or insistence or even like a stunt to get people more money in an election year, that means I think partially that they know there's nothing we will do, but honestly I feel like they don't think that they could do it if they were. wanted to in the sense sure they could sign the legislation and they could like let that money out, but in so doing they would be destabilizing the relationship between employer and employee in this service economy in a way that is not sustainable to the system, it would be, it would be like we have starved the roots, we have starved people of money and made them replace it with debt, it to effectively control them so deeply that that's that uh mechanism is now the main way that we manufacture consent for this system beyond any bullshit with uh pageantry of elections or even protests, it's that we have turned debt into a fucking cattle prod up everyone's ass, and if you give more people more money, you are literally reducing the wattage that you can blast up into their fucking a taint, and that mean that's and in a moment now when when when when when it's asset stripping time, when there is no, the time table right now is strip. the assets, sell the copper, get the pipes out of the ground, we are not distributing shit to anybody, the government doesn't do anything, the government doesn't do anything for you, just get that. your mind, the government exists for you to own your enemies with it by getting people you don't like, either shot killed, it's suffering in some way, triggered, whatever, afflicting, scouring somebody else, that's the promise of our elected officials and if we give this money then we are breaking that promise, and we are changing the elect, we're changing the game and capital flatly in this situation will not allow it to happen, now because they need that liquid. at the top now, i think the main thing to draw from this is that the idea that there's going to be a republican realignment where where the republicans become a heranvulk democracy like Tucker Carlson leads us into this uh sort of populist he long thing like from where he long is the like the national tradition. president or whatever the fuck, there's no money in the till for this, not in the sense that they couldn't do it, but in the sense that it would be too destabilizing to the system to let it be done, so that means that nobody's going to be able to run on a I'm actually going to do what Trump promised to do, platform, it can only be culture war. now that doesn't mean that the democrats are going to become more uh more populist, and the other opposite, they're going to be stuck in the same. think because these parties are still controlled by the things they're controlled by, like trumpism could have broken into become a third force in politics the way Hitlerism did under, it hypothetically could have, if things have gone differently, and most importantly if Trump wasn't who he is, if he was somebody who had the actual desire to do that, he could have, because his control over the base of that party is absolutely larger and more unified than the control, the pitly control of the party. machinery itself, but because Trump didn't care to do that and was too lazy and stupid and uncreative to even think of it, it meant that the party took him, and so what that means is there's nobody in the pipe, there's nobody with Trump's hand laid upon it who is articulated a more robust version of national socialism or or ethnonationalism or heronvolke democracy, whatever you want to call it, there's nobody who's been uh ordained and you can say Tucker Carlson. but he does not have, he will, I don't think he will have Trump's ability to be independent of the political process when he runs, because yes Star Carlson is very very famous and very popular on on the right wing of the republican party, but does he have the name recognition to run totally independently of a party machinery that like I am telling you right now, will not allow for this Haron Volk's uh populist turn. will not allow it, it means like if Josh Halley runs, it's going to be on nuke China, that's it, none of nothing else, it's going to be, we're going to get all of our all of our onks out about how bad things are and about how we refuse to help you by smashing the shit out of the chinese, that's going to be the heronvoke democracy, it's say we're going to have world war 2, but just in the terms of a massive land war in Asia, and like I think Tucker will be able to run, but like will he have the entire. united Trump base behind him, no, not unless Trump were to anoint him, and Trump doesn't care to do that. You would have to have a coherent, organized, principled, ideologically driven core at the top of a Trump uh movement that would then be able to sease control of this mechanism through the body of Trump and Trump's personal relationship to his voters. That is not happened. He is still in control of the same globalist that always was. Steve Bannon was the one guy could admit made this project happen and they kicked him to the curve five minutes later, why? not because he was like too smart for the room or too much of a danger, because he was a dumb fuck, because he over, he over emphasized his own ability to do something, he was overconfident because he was a coked up old self-important blarny stoning irish shit head, and his fucking reach was exceeded his grasp, the fucking his his his uh, his mouth was bigger than his stomach, his nostril was bigger than his bag of coke or whatever. and he of course got instantly turfed out by the united like the entire um uh immune system of the Republican Party kicked in at the institutional bureaucratic level which filled in all the spots that bannen couldn't fill because and was filled by because Trump just signed whatever right gave him like bannan lost the fight as soon as Rance Prebis was made chief of staff it was game over and banning got iced out because what the project he was doing needed somebody smarter than him. do it, so the fact that he noticed the moment doesn't make him a genius, genius would have been able to actually make something of the moment, but because Trump is the guy we got, like this deformed, short sightted, uh, slow-witted, distracted, cripplingly vain buffoon who could not seize the moment and like redirect the ship, similarly, bannon is just too thin, just some fucking coked up dipshit who like a red who like uh, like smoked a douby with uh with Brian Wilson and then read turner diaries and like it turned him into a fucking political genius. That's the people we produce in this country, just mediocrities or worse. Everybody in Washington, I realized this reading uh, this absolutely insipid review of uh of Henry Kissinger's latest book that Hillary Clinton wrote where she says, it goes from Sunsue to Tacitus to Twitter, and I just think these people are so fucking stupid, they're so dull, and what they've done is that they, they all of them confuse and with intelligence, they think that because people are driven to the top in the battle of wills against other mediocrities in a bureaucratic stew, they're the ones throthing their legs the hardest, it makes them the smartest or the best at it, no, it just means they're the ones the most pathological, because none of these people have anything other than fucking tomato bisk between their ears. and of course yes they also uh they also uh confuse ambition with virtue like do I believe good things well I want it really bad so they must be good things to want if I want them that bad so this is why I don't think unless things break in a very unpredictable way like I said like black swans you have to account for them the trajectory right now I don't think they could get it off the ground even with Tucker Carlson as the as the pilot or as the as the spruce goose or whatever um but hey, i've been wrong before, i have no idea, i still put my money on the my pillow guy, and it'll just be pure like hey, wasn't wasn't it uh, wasn't cakoon a good movie, that'll it'll just be pure last stage Alzheimer's like just a return to a soothing pass, where of course also all demon petile democrats are being executed uh on tvs at all times. but I mean if you can see three months from an election, neither party stepping forward, it either means that neither of them really want it, neither one of them want to win, they're throwing the ball back and have, it's hot potato, uh, or they just can't do it, it's outside the realm of the possibility, either because capital is explicitly vetoing it, or because the effect of capital on the political process has has so transformed I think this actually might be the explanation, I think this thinking it through, I think this is why it is, it's because this is why things aren't working, it's not even the capital saying, no we can't do this, stop it, it's because so Marks described the like a government is the executive committee of the bourgeois, and the idea here is is that there is a general thrust to capitalism, there is a capitalist social order that that has to be maintained through like structures of coersion and consent to create a market that can then be used to transmit goods back and forth that accumulate capital, and that needs to be maintained, but the thing is is that individual capitalists are not acting according to the best interest of. capital as a system, they are acting in what their perceived short-term best interest is, because that's all they can afford to pay attention, that's why these are this, that's why this is a terrible way to organize society and has to be done away with because of the massive waste, the energy just destroyed in these blind clashings of organisms that think they're separate, but are actually one part of one thing, like working this out of the system is what gets you to a point where you can actually apportion surplus. rationally and morally, which are the same thing when you have a a a a uh a consciousness that expands to the to the to the level of like a a soc a a a society or a species or something, but anyway individual capitalist firms act like individual capitalist subjects in their own short-term interests, and what that means is that they will often end up in situations where they competition is in. superior to cooperation, but they're not aware of that, like this is game theory stuff, and then they mutually destroy one another, like John Nash one Nobel Prize for talking about this stuff, and this is the state of the market without. some force that is outside of the market to coordinate it, to do traffic signs, the same way we do with what the liberals think is the necessary state, like the police and infrastructure, like government, like the government, the political class is the infrastructure of the like the the mechanism of that regulates the market, it has the same function, it is, it's the police, it's the roads, it's all the minarcast stuff, and and that... organizes and synthesizes the will of the collective will, the collective best interest of capital away from the individual interest of actors within capitalism, and that means that some are going to fail and some are going to be hurt, like the last 40 years has been huge, hugely beneficial to certain seg segments of this economy and has made them hugely wealthy, but it has destroyed others and those decisions about which winners, like that's why it's so funny when republicans talk about we don't want to pick winners and that's literally what government does, like in the 70s, the volker shock and everything else that went along with it essentially chose the winners were going to be shareholders and the losers were going to be workers, and there's some overlap there, because these are not all uh, absolute categories, so but what has happened in the last four years is as economic, the hegemony of neoliberalism destroyed the the the even the zone of action for economic policy, like it was off the table, economic policy is determined by the fed basically, it's like the the interest rate determines everything, that is the only real involvement the government can have in the economy, it does regulation at the level that the that is acceptable to industry, and then it uh does minimal oversight of everything else, and it collects some taxes. is to circulate money in the system really more than anything else uh and in return what that means though is that the zone of actual politics gets smaller and smaller, which means the people who decide to become politicians are less and less aware of what they even doing, they're less, they did, they weren't there when the the conditions were set, they've lived in the conditions, and so they think the only thing that matters is the... is the cultural bullshit that they've been arguing about for the past 40 years and so that means that they then become like and then also party the party system dissolves in favor of uh uh people rising and falling based on you know their ability to uh be a spectacle of themselves you know you either get a nice jerrymandered seat through the party system or you become a political entrepreneur like the tea party clowns and donald trump and fucking... instagram thoughts like Dan Krenshaw and Alexandria Casio Cartes, like they're all part of this new celebrity structure, and what that means is that you've rep, you've turned, you've turned politics into culture as you've turned culture into politics and that means now everyone is just only fansing their way and instagramming their way uh through the politics, which means you've recreated the market in the political area when it's supposed to be the one that's outside the market. so it's operating by the same me first rules, so they're so nearsited they can't even see the election three months ahead of them, i think there might be something to that, there's a siren, oh yes i remember this, i forgot you could hear it from here, that's the uh, that's the uh friday night. uh shabas uh siren to let the uh khasids know and the orthodox know that it's time to get indoors yeah or maybe it's the 911 siren i was uh with Chris today and we were walking on the street and there was and he noticed that there was some cops standing around he said is there are there more cops on the streets on 9/11 do you think and i think yeah they probably do it as a show of force thing but maybe they would say to stop a copy cat attack but it's amazing when you consider that the the amount of real estate that was kept that was occupied in the average American's brain by anxiety about terrorism and how that's completely gone like it's not of course the terror zone is bigger now and it contains more things but terror terrorism has gone from this giant lob of fear to this little sliver, i think part of the reason for that is, can you imagine being an al-qaeda guy and bothering blowing up something in the united states, what so that you could get like a trending topic for five minutes and it's and also what are you gonna do like you're going to set fire to a you're going to throw what i mean you're it's like you're going to dump shit on crap like we're fucked this place it sucks what kind of like what are what are you goingna be able to pierce us with like oh you blew up a building first of all we've seen that already it's just Terrorism defined our response to the 21st century, defined our economy, define, doomed us, you could argue in many ways, to not like not necessarily to apocalypse, but to to less than we would have could have had otherwise, and now it's it's a afterthought, what has been spawned out of it has been just this nightmare wirwind that is so much more monsters and and and oppressive that we can't even muster up the energy to concern ourselves with the empty shell. the husk of terrorism that used to fill our minds, yeah, 911, one of the most successful terror attacks in history, depending on who did it, not, I mean it doesn't matter if it was massad or George W. Bush or the Saudi Royal Family, or it was Al-Qaeda, like... that was a thing or it was it was or it was a prank, it was it was a someone was trying to get punked, it was just four really shitty pilots who just happened to have all started work on the same day. Oh, the official story of 911 haccurath zero, 0% chance, official, I mean, the official story is never true, I mean just for epistemological reasons, but you're not even getting closer, any government thing like that, any anything that deeply involving matters of state. is basically never more than half true and that's like at the far far end of the spectrum. i'd say that uh the official 911 story is probably more than 75% false. i'll just say that, but what's in the 25% is a question, and that's what i don't know. and people say the thing about the passport is like that is genuinely wacky, that is passport just floated down out of the thing, that is just kind of comical and in eyebrow raising as I said, but at the same time why would you do that? why would you bother with that? is it like there's they're not going to piece it together? there isn't a name on a manifest? it just seems like it's such a uh on the nose move, i'm scrolling through an article uh in the daily meal, the 101 best pizzas in america, i'm going to see if i've had any of these, and uh, if i have if they were any good, i could go for some pizza, i have to say, i wasn't, i haven't had dinner yet and looking at these pizzas, man, i could go for one, zalis, never, never been to zallies that mind though, best pizza i've ever had was a couple places, one rome, i had, it was just a random place on a corner, was phenomenal, and two, san francisco, uh, there's a there's a neapolitan, i usually don't like. politan pizza, i will admit, i don't like how wet it is in the middle and how poorly like the sauce and cheese it here to the crust and i don't really like the big fluffy crust anyway, but uh that one in San Francisco is definitely the best i've ever had, i forget it was just like a guy's name, oh zafiros from in milaque, zafiros is really good, sefiro's is great, you can get it at a movie theater, it's super super thin crust, oh it's like the best it's It's the best frozen pizza you've ever had, which in my opinion is a huge compliment. does anyone know frank something's it's a name, it's a guy's name, i would like to try comic ping-pong sometime, i can't feel like i'm kicking myself, frank Peppe is in new haven and it's very good, um, it's in the old Italian neighborhood, north beach, Yeah, I think it's Tony's, yes, I think that's it. You know what, the thing is, I'd really like a frozen pizza, I should always get frozen pizza. Oh shit, I just realized I'm talking about pizza here and people are going to think that this is proof that I'm a part of the kabal, I really just enjoy it, and that's one of the reasons that i i kind of try, that's that's one of the ways i pull myself back from falling too far over the brink and the whole you know the whole episten brain thing is yeah people talk about pizza a lot but pizza is like really good and cheap and it's a thing everyone eats it's relatable it's if you start looking for pizza you're going to find it a lot of places it's not like it's flagraw Oh bar and newhaven I had that it was really good. My favorite pizza topping has traditionally been pepper. but i think i'm getting to the point where i really like minced garlic, i do love gelato, oh it might have been, it might have been uh, it might actually have been modern in newhaven, my stomach is literally rumbling right now, no tat, no no caparino, wait a minute somebody. saying mandela effect versus totinos versus tostinos uh, i'm afraid not for me, it was always toutinos and people said tostinos were wrong, it was clearly wrong, yeah, if you thought it was tostinos, that's your fault, i'm not going to validate your uh, your your delusion. I do like anchovy sometimes, I'm not gonna not going to lie, it's uh, defara i've had once and found it very, very mediocre, maybe I just had a bad one, hey Tony's pizza in the palitana is number 29, I mean at least it's high of the west, Robertos is okay, I actually prefer speedy Romeos to Robertas when you're talking. like high-end fancy pizzas, speedy romeo is my favorite of those pats, i have not had, it's right near me though, i should go to patsy, maybe do they deliver, maybe go to patsies today, yeah i might do it. All right, I'm getting to the number one slice, the number one pizza in America, John's on Bleeker, I've had and it's pretty good, I don't know if it's number three, I honestly don't think it's number three, but john's on Bleeker is good, I had it once, it was very good, but I think I'd say the San Francisco one's better, Pquads, that is number two here and that is Felix's favorite. we tried to get peekwads when we were in uh Chicago in 2016, in fact the famous picture of me dressed like a baby in front of a baby who is also dressed like me uh was taken while we were waiting to get into peequads but sadly it was too big of a fucking uh line it was lalala so those fucking jack asses were in there so we had to go next door and have and I'm disappointed because I genuinely not a huge fan of Chicago style pizza he insists it's the best I would give it a shot. and then they got Frank Peppes is number one, pretty good, pretty good, I i'd say those are those are all fine and I would love to try peak one sometime and find out how it is. There is no good pizza in Ireland, that is correct, there are no good tacos in Ireland, they do a few things well, you want a lamb stew, they're your people, you want some muscles, those are pretty good, fish and chips, I know it's English, but they do it good too, uh, some sort of pud puding pie, but they're not, they're not good with pizza. some of the best piets I've ever had actually was in South Paulo Brazil which has a a large Italian population, but apparently Rio pizza, I never had, but apparently pizza in Rio de Janeiro is criminally terrible, like surreally bad. Someone says Pquads is not good at all, shot, fired. I mean, I don't really, I don't credit Felix. too much with with uh gourmand taste, he basically just eats beyond burgers and since he's gone vegetarian, he just eats beyond sausage and burgers on different different like buns and shit, i bet south korean pizza is bad, i would not think of them, i mean they are the dairy asians but i don't think that they could really like get pizza, although i've heard of course very terrible things about Swedish pizza, something involving bananas, is this true? is this are those sick mutants putting bananas on fucking pizza as i am hearing happens and like curry, banana curry pizza, and then they put a bunch of weird uh like vinegar uh cabbage on it, call it pizza salad, mutants, no wonder they decided to just stoically accept corona death, they're eating that kind of shit, they're all praying. of corona, they call a lethal corona of diagnosis winning the lottery in Sweden, because who would want to eat that God forsaken garbage? I like, I like Detroit style, a lot of people were exposed to Detroit style without knowing it, because uh, I think that the the standard like what they called, what uh, hand t what was it hand tos or deep dish? i think deep dish, like not like Chicago style deep dish, but they would they, but the deep dish style pizza hut was essentially a New York style pizza, it did, i don't think it had the the sauce on top, but it had the same crust, so people would get that and not even know it was detroit style, back when back when pizza was the nicest restaurant in many midwestern towns. what i could really go for it and speaking of chicago style pizza is tavern style pizza that's super thin super thin crust with the little slice the edges on the sides oh that's the stuff. I've seen the Trump pizza commercial, he did uh, he did the pizza commercial where he he goes, I made a deal, I eating the pizza, the other way, I mean by the cross, and then he did of course the McDonald's commercial with Grimace where he did a job interview with Grimace, what a country, huh? Best chain pizza, I think it's the extra thin. crust dominos, that is really good, extra thin crust dominos is uh, is a pimply choice for pizza fans anywhere among among nationwide chain places. Yeah, I'm in the testinos universe, you toustinos people meet amongst yourselves to get figure out how you're gonna get back into the rift, because honestly if I if I was thought I was a tostinos person, I might decide, yeah, let's find a rift, maybe in Tustinos world 9/11 never happened, you know, maybe in Tostino's world we didn't get this monstrous trajectory. we we we kind of took a breath in a moment and and recalibrated our our desires, I mean obviously this is highly unlikely, but maybe the Tastinos universe figured things out. out a little bit, not, not perfect, things are still probably pretty bad in a lot of ways and they probably have no idea how good they have it, they think things are critical, but we look at them and we be like, my god, they're so much closer than we are, so yeah, i would try to find the destino's universe if i thought there was one, but if there is it's not mine, this is my universe, i am lashed to the mast of the sinking ship of the totinos. Universe, yeah, Bernie is president of the tostinos universe, but he's been president, he won in 2016 and we we are on our path to a climate uh uh amelioration and every uh massive uh uh superstorm is met with huge. construction projects and green technology all over the place and transfer of green technology to emerging nations to cut down cooperation at the level of governments to mutually draw down the way that we mutually drew down nuclear uh stock piles in the 70s somebody uh somebody asked if i to get Seth Rogan. on the show, i don't know what we would talk about, i would i would, maybe i would tell him that one time i had an idea for a movie with him and james franco, you know, pineapple express style, and the gimmick would be that he would be uh, he would play marks, and james franco would pay lennon, or no, lennon, not uh engels and the only thing i had was a scene where they were at like a meeting and jonah Hill shows up as baccoonen and they start busting. each other's balls like it's a judge apet movie, judge reinhold and judge apatau uh and i had one like joke where rogan mark says hey uh hey michael how's the secret society going you guys got dacota rings yet and then bacuna goes no you're totally right marks yeah you you're going to have revolution by writing a fucking 5,000 page long economics textbook because there's nothing working class people love doing more than fucking long division, but i think that that would uh that's more like a funnier die sketch than an actual movie, it would be way, it would it would it would drill itself into the ground within five minutes, it would wear, it wouldn't even, it would it would get overlong as an S&L's get. All right guys, I i'm up on an hour here and I got to go because I got to get pizza dudes, pizza dudes got 30 seconds, anyone know what that's from, anybody 100 years old, teenage me ninja turtles, correct, well done. Kudo sucer. All right, this uh, this thing's getting wobbly so I better sign off, peace and chicken grease.
