 That was a young man, I carried my pack and I lived the free life of a rover, and the marry's green basin to the dusty outback, I think they're cool, watch my Matilda all over, till in 19. 19:15 my country said son, it's time to stop rambling, for there's work to be done, so they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun, they sent me away to the war, and the band played wall sing matilda, as we said bild away from the cave, but a midst all the cheers and the shouts and the tears, we sailed off for gallipoly, great, great tune, we all love it, don't we folks, we all love it and i'll be anormy, i like the pogue version the most, i like the i like shane mcgowen's voice, not gna lie, i'm uh I'm a plastic patty at heart even though I'm pretty sure I'm basically not any of the I don't have any hated bogman in me according to my pointless uh well the thing is they're all germans anyway everybody's croutts everybody's a fucking crowd even the kelts so I want to start by addressing a question that someone asked yet last week that I think realize on reflection i didn't answer terribly well and it was they asked me about um about idealism versus materialism as like a way to approach life and history and you know everything else reality even and they said well isn't the notion of class consciousness idealist because the idea is it's an idea it's oh there's a class consciousness that we have to operate from and then that changes our behavior by baking us joing uh unions maybe or do strikes or fight a revolution, that's all ideas and i kind of got hung up on the word definition, and i think and i think it's just because you know certain people come at questions from a different like uh understanding of the terms involved, so they're going to like ask you questions and sort of hit you at an angle, but now that i thought about it more, i think the key to understanding the distinction here is to say: we've got a say for example, we've got the constitution, right? uh, yeah, we're going to talk about the book tomorrow, uh, by the way, i'm i'm almost done with my with the section and i'm very very enjoying it, i'm going to go through probably chapter by chapter on that one, because there's a lot of really important stuff, like uh, the shit on the uh, the strike of 1877 is very important, but anyway, we have a constitution in this country, right? we have constitutional order, now why is that? why do we? have a constitution, why is written the way it is? there's one theory that says, well it's because the founding fathers believed x, y and z about natural rights and governance and that that's why it's the way it is. that is an idealist understanding of history. there is another that says these were the richest people in North America at the time, they were fighting essentially a separatist war the same way that like the trade federation was in the prequels to get a better deal in the global uh market for their product. which they saw as a local product because it benefited local ruler uh local uh elites, landowners, large landowners in the south and uh and merchants in the north, and they fought on behalf of their prerogatives to extract money from the earth to turn America into cash, they didn't want to give anymore to... the global trade system or the demands of the crown taxation or more importantly uh reduction in the amount of trade that the US could uh carry off. the Boston t party, people think of as some sort of protest against the tax on tea. that's not the case, there was no tax on tea that led to the boston tea party. what it happened was is that for a number of complicated reasons, the British had decided to unwind or had decided that they needed to recapit is basically the uh the uh the East India company which was producing tea in vast quantities in the Indian uh subcontinent and was then having to you know uh around the world as part of our beloved triangle trade uh and that uh as a way to streamline its operations, the crown said, look, all tea is going to come through uh, not through individual uh uh purveyers that you make deals with as individual merchants in Boston, which allow you to act as a middleman for the global uh trade, we would like you to get all of your tea from the uh East India Company, which you know that's a guarantee revenue stream for them, props them up, essentially a public bailout. the private company, but they are not really, they're the same thing, basically, the state and these these like corporate organs are at at the very root, the same thing, and that was a that's a conflict of interest between the the the uh, like the British economy as a thing in which America's colonies, like colonies are part of, and the new local domestic elite, the large land owners and and merchants in North America to did not see it that way, and and so the Dawston tea party was a rebellion against the uh reduction in the freedom of trade of merchants, not even the tea no, not people got the tea, people who buy the tea and then resell it, and the fact is is that the tea act that was being protested, brought t prices down, it was more efficient, it reduced overhead, what it did is it cut the margins of the fucking Boston merchants, so if you understand? you understand the constitution is the way it is to protect in the interest of power, to protect the people who hold capital, to make sure that we have enough of a fasad of democracy to allow for um, the expression of political demands that are channeled away from real centers of power and towards structural epinomenon like the political system, so that's an idealist, but so so that's that's the actual materialist understanding of why the constitution says what it says, why it values what it values, and the thing about an idea, but the thing is is that whether it's materialist understanding of that historical moment or an idealist one, me saying it is an idea, it's still an abstraction, it's still an idea, adhering to it is adhering to an idea, but it is an idea that is generated by an understanding of reality as a material interaction, not as an idealized place. where ideas are disconnected from the material conditions that uh generate them, and so class consciousness is simply uh, workers going from believing what the superstructure of capitalist society tells them to believe, because that's the beauty of, that's why idealist history is reactionary, that's why idealism is reactionary, because it serves capital by neutralizing descent from it, all of that alienation i feel as a alienated and exploited capitalist subject. gets steamed away because I believe ideas about what what like what the constitution stands for, what good and bad are, how what happened in history, that rip me away from the reality of my daily capital exploitation, when I've come to the realization that oh, it is actually material interest to shape this stuff, that the constitution doesn't have value beyond its ability to assert class rule, and that therefore I am in opposition to the... systems, then that because the content of their ideas is meaningless and you are, you then are uh put in a position where you can banish the ghosts, the spooks of the constitutional order, of democracy, of patriotism, all that stuff, and it's because you have adapted an idea, it's still an idea that you drive through every day and that takes you know individual experience and gives an order and gives turns into an ideology at a praxis, but it is generated by real experience of... oppression, not by being convinced of ideas, that's secondary, that is why liberalism will always be at the a fundamental basis incompatible with, with marxism, with socialism and will have to be defeated, it can be negotiated with and used against itself, because it's ruled by that non-class class that... middle class, that is the party of politics, that's the political party, is the lower middle class, because the super rich, politics is beside the point, they just sign checks, for those poor, it's beside the point, because they have no power, all power, when you have all the power and none of the power to political system, you have no reason to care about it, it's in that middle strata that we convince ourselves that there's meaning in this politics, because we do things like have jobs that are positioned intention between proletariat and and uh and capitalist and pull us in one or another direction and that push and pull is what generate politics as we understand it. so does that make sense? the difference between uh of idealism and materialism? the middle class is is the political class, and they and they are the ones who who assign values to this stuff and then fight over them, because that's what keeps them literally pay, that's why we have uh professional politicians, that's why we have a professional political media. That's why that stuff exists, to keep everybody busy, and also at a certain level you steer the ship, you are able to exert pressure, but it is in a very fast remove, and the more removed, the more it's ruled by idealistic understandings of ideas, and not materialist understanding of ideas and values. but that's uh one thing that's interesting about, i'm not going to talk too much about it because we're going to talk about it tomorrow, but the section of uh the book that we're reading that i'm reading uh the section of the republic for which it stands is in the process of talk he does a very good job of talking about the the the uh the history of the ideological war that's being fought among the you know the middle class throughout that period and he he essentially is able to very very elegantly explained to you how the word liberal went from being in the 19th century uh conservative classical liberal to meaning now progressive whatever we want to call that and he explains the process and it is one whereby the same class of people, not the same individual people, the same class people go from believing in free market, lasai fair. to becoming opposed to in favor of like radical state intervention on behalf of class and race discrimination right? how does that happen? and what happens is is that we went from a time when liberalism was corresponded with the idea of positive change in revolution, when it had revolutionary potential, because remember the first part of the communist manifesto is. and Marx praising capitalism for the way that it uprooted old traditions that prevented humankind from reaching its potential that that like when he talks about all the sil and melting into air you know uh at that time a lot of that uh destruction was truly creative destruction in the chumpertarian sense like that was part of capitalism's potential and it did shape things and it created institutions and ideas that were going to go on to challenge capitalism like marxism couldn't have had it with out capitalism emerging to to to define itself against and like the idea of of taking the unleashed energies of like a more rationalized economy, a more technologically intensive economy, which means a less sacred economy, which means a more exploitative economy, because it it abstracts human potential and human life away and makes it fungable, like it makes slavery something like... the American slavery or not just united states but western hemispheric slavery was uniquely terrible in the in history of most slave societies because it was the most uh it's the one where slaves themselves were these were the most uh fungable where they were turned into an exchange they were like they became capital and that had never really happened before not necessarily because of like an evil of intent but just just a rationality and efficiency of exchange being b into the mechanism, so that's terrible, but it also has, it it's what gives us the technological innovation to store surpluss and and and allow ourselves to build like build culture, which is to say the ability to come into recognition that we are not individuals or parts of clans or something, but part of a human race, the the the coming into itself that that Hegel speaks about and that marx describes as like the the ideal arc of human consciousness, not necessarily one that we will get to, common ruin of the contending classes is the ruler in the clubhouse right now, ladies and gentlemen, get your bets in while you can, but there is still, there is a teleological heart to that, and it requires us to harness these things instead of allowing them to totally over overpower us and overcome us, so in that era liberals were in a sense revolutionary, like during the civil war, they said we must uproot this hory old feudal. concept of buying and and selling people, which was now interacting with capitalism to create something horrifying that was worse than anything ever seen before, because you're taking a feudal concept of power, like a mystified coersive concept of power and electrifying it with the fucking profit motive and with uh with modern uh technological uh facilitations of trade and and monetization and financialization of capital, it it was, it created a monstrosity that it never seen before, but when it was harnessed the right way, you had the yoman fantasy of North America, you have the small holder who is himself free of superstitions, free of old institutions, free of lords, free of government of any kind, able to exert himself freely on the land, sure it required the displayation of the Indians, but hey, eventually, once they got with the program, they would become citizens like us, they'll all become citizens like us, on the long line, everybody becomes a citizen, which means an autonomous being, and that wasn't a an idea of liberty, a liberal idea of liberty that is anglo-american in origin, because that is where capitalism accelerated. off of the plane and created its own thing that it then recapitulated across the land through the ever tightening crank of Wallenstean's world system but it promised liberation but then by the 1870s and 80s after having used the power of the sword to end slavery but then refused to use it to allow uh the former slaves to become integrated into the political system and to the the social system, which could have been possible, but would have required the the subordination of capital to a social end, and the powers at the moment did not align to allow that to happen, instead, the social end was was sacrificed to the creation of a a new leviathan of public and private power that used that power to immiserate, to bash away. the the tendrils of connection socially that it had been allowed to uh build and also hack away at those those freedom tendrals that that that's that the ability to be a yoman sufficient farmer even who would never have to sell his labor that's gone because even the farmers are are fucking working for banks or railroads and what when what was the result uh the return of uh despoilative monstrous coersive labor and racial apart. of the south, the massimiration of peasants uh in in the of former peasants rather pile up as refuse in um the eastern cities, the catholic uh peasantry turned into a hyper-exploited urban laboring class devoid of any ability to to raise themselves up to the idea of like a middle class American standard, and then um out west, the slow but steady massacre of the continents uh... original inhabitants, the the civilized army coming in and literally destroying the people uh, a people who even these liberals could see held virtues in their social order that were not to be found in the in the course soil of this new society they created, and what happened is is that over time the liberals got pissed off and became conservative, but the younger liberals who came up after them, who started believing the... same ideas came from the same social milieu, which is important, and why i say that, i mean the wig social milieu of middle class um polite society in the east coast, boston, philadelphia, new york, that's what we're talking about, the shermer horns of fifth avenue from uh from uh gangs new york, by the mid-1880s and or so the the the the liberal idea had failed so comprehensively that you either became a conservative, you either just decided that you were reactionary, or if you were younger and you were see coming into life, seeing the failure of the ideas as they're being told to you, you accommodate the new reality that okay, there's that has to be a level of state intervention greater than what we think in order to allow capitalism to exist, allow individual freedom, allow contract liberty, the things we worship, we have to have longer uh, we have to have more of a state intervention, or else the whole thing will just collapse and savagery, savage domination, like the kind we banish with the civil war, we thought, and that's when you get progressive, and it isn't, it's the same social group, that's the important thing to notice, and then the changeover is it one of that is the one is the same sort of transition over time through attribution, the one funeral at a time, progress that Thomas Coon talks about in the structure of scientific revolutions, when he says that scientific. change doesn't happen because people are convinced of new by new evidence, the old people die and new scientists show up and they learn the right thing because they're they don't already have the wrong thing in their head, it's the same thing with the social sciences. which is essentially what we're talking about, these these the political groupings around the parties and the uh the institutions of uh like consent manufactury in the mass media, those things are all part of that um, there are part of that same class, that same class that gravitates around the finance capital of the east coast uh cities and so they become progressives and that progressive vision over time then like eventually it has to absorb race because the the crisis becomes too deep along racial lines to for them to imagine civilization that is civilized capitalism to exist, they're the forces within capitalism trying to insist on social uh on a social piece that is short of the naked authoritarianism of the slave owner. they're essentially trying to clothe the slave owners uh steel hand with the velvet mit of democracy and rule of law and all those things, but the thing is is that that habit of mind comes from living in polite, literally polite society, and since the beginning of American history, they have been a battle with local ruling power, that is not as connected, maybe connected in the sense that it needs eastern capital, but not intimately connected in its dealings with eastern capital, local power, first the slave voting south and then the petty barons who made up the uh new deal reactionary core took over the republican party, the beautiful boters, they're the unsheed uh fist, what is this, a theory reaches crisis, then the different new theories emerge to replace the old one, exactly, you get to a point where new shit comes to light because of experimental models because of crisis is within the prevailing ideas, and then the old people. insist it's still uh wrong, but then they die, and the new people who become scientists adapt to the more persuasive model, that's what happens among social scientists, but they can only go so far because they are all committed to capitalism sustaining itself, they are always assuming that this is to keep society functional, and it's because they are civilized, because they're in the drawing rooms of the east and they're connected to global capital flows and they're connect, they're connected to the global system, and they get the... education, they realize that a lot of the stuff that is blood and thunder in politics, racial distinctions, national distinctions are actually meaningless and that capital is the really the only thing, they essentially get inducted into the room in network where Ned Baity gives them the talk, like they get that talk through their genes and their blood and through their social interactions, you don't get that in the frontieer, and the American political contest is basically except for the period from like 1930. 3 until about 1979 uh when the working class asserts itself as an actual force in politics, they are the only two people arguing, those are the polls that politics is argued around, and that is now how we have the alignment that we have, and what we're seeing with the non-college educated people entering into the electorate and voting for Trump and voting for the republicans, regardless of the race to some degree, at least outside of you know the definitional of black America, although even there you're seeing a small trend, it's because for a lot of those working class people, they were never convinced by any of the cultural stuff, any of the cultural shit about the democratic party, they were there for the actual uh working class part, they were there for the work the assertion of working class uh uh interests, but that's gone and it's only the shell of the Democratic party that still has it, and people are essentially losing their brand loyalty. they're seeing like the the fucking the the label is coming off the can and all they're seeing is a fucking can of shit, they're they're seeing a a can of accelerated capitalist exploitation but with a a gloss of social values that they were never inculcated into because they're not the part of the political class, the college going to polite class. and the reason it's confused is because there was a third force here that brove the a lot of people regardless of what? they got their culture uh to the democrats and that was articulated working class influence on the political process which started with the great depression and ended with the crisis of the 70s. you could even argue it it honestly ended with the purging of uh the uh communists from the cio in the early 50s if you want to like get real uh class technical with it. but it's one or the other. it starts in 33 and it's over by... at the latest Regan and maybe even by fucking Isenhower. So There you go, those are the those are the forces that work, those are the fighters, those are those are Moriori and homes going over the falls, it's urban, middle-class, finance capitalized, culturally uh progressives, who used to be in the 1850s, liberal in the classical sense, because that's what constituted revolutionary thought at the time, but the contradictions within liberalism required a new answer. and progressivism emerged from that conflict and then the liberals all died off or their their real inheritors are cranks who turned into conservatives from that position, but those people are perverts, they are not part of the same process. so what you have now is an alliance between the perverted middle. class, the perverted college educated, and then uh, the non-perverse reactionary, both rich and poor, similarly, the left, uh, the democratic party is uh, a few. middle class perverts who are like perverted - no i'm talking about like okay no if i'm talking about like actual no no no no middle class perverts because the thing is is that you think they're perverts because they're against capitalism but that's just it they're not they're the ones trying to keep this thing going they're the ones trying to clothe this thing in enough human skin to keep the fucking villagers from fleeing they are actually working in capitalism interest so they're not perverse they're not perverse at all "the real perverts are the ones who decide that they are actually opposed to capitalism in its entirety and therefore the liberal project of sustaining capitalism, but they still are emotionally invested in the democratic party and people within it and root for them on a visiral emotional level. there is some perversion. so there you go, those are your working middle class." perverts within the democratic party, and of course the groipers and the fucking pepe types are the pervert middle class people among the republicans. And then you've got the people who still think that the Democratic Party means something, but it doesn't anymore. Democratic party does not mean anything. The this was the when the working class se to be a coherent pressure group within it, it was over, oh man that google union, i don't want to, i don't want to talk out a turn too much cuuse i don't actually know the specifics of the thing uh, but so google has announced this union drive and from what i understand and correct me if I'm wrong, it's a minority union that does not have the ability and I think is actually legally enjoined from negotiating over salary right, and like I think also most working condition stuff, what it is, they've said is essentially a way to facilitate activism within Google, and a lot of the people who I've seen interviewed about it are inclusivity directors. and the thing about that is is that those include all those inclusivity jobs that are in corporations that they like to point to like the diversity and inclusivity uh director, the kind of jobs that uh uh people often demand get people who get like a lot of times you'll see protests at universities that they that that uh are about increasing diversity or you know uh minority representation and minority quality of life and they will demand like diversity officers and stuff. Those are HR, that's HR, that's the people whose job it is to find a way to fire you without los without having to pay for it, that's the that's the that's what they are in the hierarchy. HR departments exist to reduce liability of corporations visa with their employees, they're a way to union bust, and uh, reduce liability of the company to uh. employee behavior and they and they are also mostly used to intimidate employees, they are fucking pinkertons, they're white colorlar pinkertons and if there are people who are organizing, if people organizing the google union are fucking HR officers, then it is a company union that will only be used to get people fired for postts that will exist so that if somebody at Google is complaining about something like I don't know working conditions or maybe like hey should we be building panopticons for the ci for the fucking NSA or you know should we should we be uh using weger slave labor for uh our uh you know our fucking phones and hey, maybe we should have more direction over the company's investments, they can, there's something problematic they said, there's something that that could be used to say that they made a hostile work environment, those people's job will be to find it, and then when they get fired for troublemaking, it will be a win for workers power, that's the sickness at it, that's the sickness at the heart of this, this is why this machine is so dastardly and breathtaking in its power, because everything is recuperated within it, every good instant. right to actually negotiate over conditions of work and uh and wages, that is all I really know and therefore I'm skeptical and I feel like when news comes out about this thing, do not just start sallivating like a pavlovian dog because you see the word union, buse it's like capitalism knows that all these things, they know what you guys care about and they can fucking create uh, they are very good at at haven't we seen my god the last few years, the way that all cultural expressions of uh of like um of solidarity and and social uh, you know, the aspirations towards social justice are commodified and recuperated instantly into reinforcings of the status quo? you don't think that that would go towards unions too? i'm not saying it does, but it needs to be considered, just like don't just immediately have to defend something when you don't know the context, when so much of... this stuff is designed to capture and dissipate energy, which is why once again, broken record me, disengaging from the discourse is so vital, because the fucking google union doesn't really concern you, there's nothing you can do about it, they're not going to stop unionizing because you posted that it was cringe, and they're not going to keep doing it cuz you said go girl, it's not really up to you, you don't have to have an opinion on it. What about, what about work, what about where you work, what about what, what about your relationships with other employees in your labor sector, the questions there are going to be closer to the ground and easier to answer and less, less confounding and mystifying by their association with the the this inherently uh distorting um matrix of information dissemination. and money i just wanted to say this to say diversity and inclusivity offices are they don't work for you, they work for the company, they exist as organs of control, they're not your friend, and i think that's something that is unarguable, and if you see anyone defending that, that's suss, because i do believe that you should always under admit good faith, you should always assume good faith in. because otherwise you just get into the cycle of where it's nothing but friend and fo and nothing is learned because you cannot dialogue, which is the only way to generate new understanding and new meaning uh, but man, if you're if you're gonna say that HR departments are not explain to me how they don't, where are they getting their paychecks, I mean how much of their stock is, how much of their fucking uh um, by the way, how much of their fucking salary is literally stock options, how much is their personal? political wealth connected to the ups and downs of the public estimation of the company they work for, and how does that put them in your corner in any dispute with any other employee or with them? oh, it's a bad take okay, never mind, never mind, if you want to explain to me how that's how i'm wrong. Tell me, they're direct employees. and also like if that's your job, if your specialty is HR, then you can't really work in anything else anyway, so it's not like you can go outside of the system to be some sort of editorial HR, some obnan budsman of employment, because there's no one there to fund that, follow the money is usually in bonali the right? thing to say about any of this stuff, the moth man stood at the intersection of idealism and materialism because the moth man, i think can be understood at least in part as a manifestation of human mental energy, literally transsubstantiating ideas into material reality. That's why I think it's such a fascinating case and something that I think is due a much better, much better filmic uh interpretation in that dog shit Richard Gear movie, my god, that was so clearly an attempt to just rip off the x files, let's do the xpiles for a movie, but it's not expiles, going with the very dark, forboding attitude, trying to make it scary, which huge mistake, moth man is a comedy, one... million percent moth man is a goddamn comedy, if it's going to work, it's going to be a comedy, instead it was this like brooding scary like thriller that had like a few scary voice telephone calls, that was about as scary got like a voice going, oh there's going to be a bad saster coming, oh no, they're going to be they're going to follow the river, and then some eyes in the darkness or something, dog shit, terrible. there needs to be a better uh mothman, we deserve a better class of mothman around this joint, buse i like the idea of maybe it was an MK ultra site, you know, and maybe it was at the same time as that, it was a harmonic convergence of like electromagnetic fields or something that could get the human tuning forks ping, get our pineal glands juiced, and maybe they actually created a fucking mathman. maybe they made a real mouth man, pulled it out of the multiverse, oh influencer watch, is that that kind of uh kiwiky thing where it's supposed to be public dossiers of all of the left influencers or making your children uh trans, there are supposed to be for paranoid right-wingers. to like keep an eye on us, it's pretty funny, i'm flattered certainly that they think i'm worth uh keeping track of, i guess that's the podcaster equivalent of 60's radicals uh seeing if they have an FBI file, yes much, much lamer, i know that's the point is that we're much lamer, we're not we're not the men, our fathers were debree, we don't even look like them. like Nixon's enemies list, oh oh boy, somebody asked me about the bronze age pervert, I really honestly I get, I think about it for a second and I just think i'm tired, I can't, I've never been able to will myself to to spend more than a second, going like this at his profile like aspiring nude bodybuilder. what i mean, how do you aspire to be a nude bodybuilder? what's keeping you from bodybuilding nude? is it that like you have to go to planet fitness? are you aspiring to the day that planet fitness drops its clothing necessary uh policies and allows you to go in there nude? like you can't fucking lift in your backyard or something with no pants on and after that i just stop paying attention. I mean anybody who wants talk who's like at valorizing the brand age, it's like get out of here, you're nondialectical, I don't want to redo this shit, I want to fucking advance the ball down the goddamn field, I'm on the team, you're not on the fucking team if you want to just chill in the goddamn bronze age, sorry, you're on the team, you want to advance the ball down the field, you're you're not fucking in it for stats. Will the internet add my? collapse, this is a very interesting question, so i was talking about this with Felix on twitter yesterday, it is obviously a fact i think undisputed by any serious commentator that advertising as such doesn't really work, it never has, it does not have the there's no proof that it has the relationship to production, to purchasing that we think it does, what it does though is it provides a context for purchases, it makes purchases possible. you cannot have a consumer society that buys as much as we do and associates our freedoms as much as we do with our purchases without advertising, not individual ads, but the concept, if we are not being advertised too, we will not be, we will not trade our freedom for purchases, because they will not be emotionally charged, they will not be turned into fetishes by advertising, it literally does magic to our brains. to associate not even specific things, but categories of purchases as connected to pleasure as connected to self uh actualization, they manufacture the um, they manufacture not just the consent, but the self interest that that consent is grounded in, which is i get this stuff, why does this stuff matter? because I'm seeing this art, I'm seeing this culture that produces these values every second, and it defines my brain, my brain wants what it's given to want, so that's what ads do, but specifically ads don't do anything, and what we have with the online ad is a situation where the only thing that drives money through the silicon valley pipe, because we all know that silicon valley is built on forward money, it's all... really quality quantitatively ease money, it's just the Fed just putting numbers on a board and tip uh they they essentially put numbers on a board to create a bunch of money in DC, and then they just tip the board of the United States over and it all oses over into the fucking Bay area in the form of fucking investments in uh the tech industry, most of which are never seen again, but where there is money to be made there it is in companies that are almost entirely predicated on. had dollars, google and Facebook, the only one of these companies that actually make money and make the most money and and companies that sell and the companies that are like that and that do make short-term profits that boost up mid like short-term interest or short-term like returns for hedge funds all come from add revenue based businesses, that's where the money comes from, not from selling a real thing, not from a real product, from selling eyeball space. It doesn't do anything, they just found out that uh of the $150 million dollars that uh uh the that lift or that yeah lift was spending or Uber rather Uber was spending on targeted online ads that they were overpaying by $100 million dollars because the numbers were all just made up by these companies in terms of like look throughs and click through all like the stuff that's supposed to that people are actually watching it, it's all ginned up, it's all made up, it's Arthur Anderson stuff, it's Mark to market accounting, it's Enron, and so they just found out, oh here it is, literally 100, 100% of the money we were spending, no, no, 200% of the money we were spending on ads was wasted, it didn't move the needle at all, but the thing about it is is that it doesn't matter, no even if you knew this, even if this... got out in some way and it became common knowledge, it wouldn't change anything, because the ad dollars are not there to represent value in the forms of actual value for ads anymore than advertisements exist to drive purchases of a specific product, they are there to create the flow of money through the system that capitalism necessitates, they are the capillary action, it's that is what we have, that's the that's is the real value, it is the same as the petro dollar, it is a data dollar, data is the stored value where we hold the exchange thing, but it's just an abstraction of our relationship to the economy, our relationship to America's government, because it's all backed on America's state capacity, that is what backs all exchanges within the dollar denominated system, american state capacity. Now that means that it's incredibly incredibly unstable and rickety and could be blown over by a gust of wind, but also it is so crucial to the maintenance of the system as such, and with no alternative really presenting itself in the moment, means that it's essentially unmovable in the near-term future. No wonder everyone is always on the edge all the time, everything is in this state. where you are reaching a deep crisis within these systems, but they are more than ever crucial load bearing parts of the system. so what happens? who's to say? and the real point of the money going through the silicon value. turn puckle, it creates an actual economy, in like the the physical space, a real estate based economy in California, that is essentially a buyoff to the ruling local classes of California, it's like, yes, yes, sorry, sorry, we're destroying the the country's economy, we're turning it all, we're turning all jobs into techno feudal surf jobs where we've stripped you of all benefits and all uh control over your labor, sorry, in exchange, we will build it here and get your price. values up through the roof so that every fucking asshole like a public school teacher who bought a house in the fucking south bay is now a millionaire bottom off but then what it does for the global system is it creates technology of control and coersion in the form of the penopticon that they're building with our money they're literally building with our money the pinopticon around us they're building the robot the robocop is in our head is being constructed, so that's very important, and then there's another one too, I forgot, there's another thing that it's building, like an actual thing that's being produced and in addition to the Pennopticon technology, oh fuck, I forgot, yeah, of course they've been doing it since the 70s, this is all when this all things started. 70s, of course it did, it's roots are all over California, California is when the reaction began. America was this tide pushing itself towards the ocean, and then when it hit the fucking uh border, it pushed back. American modern reactionary thought its entire superstructure was built in California. Fucking Orange County is is the is the birthplace of the modern Conservative movement just in terms of the political structure, the defense industry that built the southern. California economy is what we where we directed our Kansian spending after World War II and which absorbed all of our social forces away from productive ones and towards war towards a creating a fucking empire as opposed to directing you know our surplus towards democratizing life in America by investing inward no no we had to create weapons and it all started in California buse that was the... of the myth, the real end, we didn't get it, the memo, we haven't got the memo till now, but the body felt it back then, and it reacted instantaneously, the machine app operated to its own advancement, because it is an algorithm, it is skynet, and only unless the humans get together to fight and subdu it, it will consume everything, because that's the difference between capitalism and all previous modes of production, all previous modes of production at the end of the day were for human. benefit, maybe the benefit of a small click of people at the very top, but there was no one outside the human race who had a say. capitalism is able to was able to take over the world because it abstracts away from the person, the violence of coursion and towards systems that let us off the hook for carrying out violence, and that's why we're able to coerse each other through the machinery of turning people into modern subjects, which is a violent destructive thing that killed everybody, machinery killed everybody from the deaths of imperialism to slavery to all the deaths under communism, the fucking great leap forward, every fucking hollow dormore you want to talk about, the fucking pull pot and the goddamn, it's all part of that same process of abstracting away from daily life, literal sacredness, god human spirituality and turning it into an abstraction, and that charged that abstraction with godhood and capital is god in the sense that even if you got everybody in a room together they would and they all wanted to do it's best for everybody they would be compelled not by any person in that room even if they all said what they felt. It's the market and that had we can only by concentrating our fucking energies and and coordinating our activities against it, can we actually fight it? I'm a libra. No, wait a minute, is that the the main one? what's the star sign? Capricorn moon. I think the capricorn moon is what keeps me so grounded. Capitalism kind of sus, not going to lie, I agree, shit's whack, but at the same time, like like ash in aliens, alien, you have to admire its purity, it is, like it is the antagonist to humanity that we literally built to destroy ourselves, it's kind of wild, like our inability to... our inability to trust, let us to create systems that allowed us to allowed our guard down enough about our hostility and our essential zero sum relationship to reality, that allowed us to sleep at night, which is to abstract them away into weapons and then into systems of thought and control that act as weapons or that coordinate the action of weapons and that created something that was greater than the power of any of us and that turns us all into sorcers apprentices, now we it's run away from us, it's captured us, like you cut off a limb and it will go back with this same algorithm unless it's uprooted, it has to be pulled out, and that's only by taking that which it is created and turn it into the best version of itself, which is the most coordinated version, which is the most spiritually charged version, which is the part of humanity that is able to act really as one, not smoothly, not. but socially to have the coordinated power of a single organism. those will be the people have broken free of of their addiction to to catharsis through entertainment, which encompasses everything from pornography to politics to... uh sports to online politics obviously. All right, I'm going to wrap it up here, anybody has a last question, it includes everything, I'm not saying that everybody, anybody can log off completely, that's absurd, it's impossible, it's part of us and it will never be logged off, like you can't imagine that any future that's going to be able to redeem humanity is going to be one where we have a ludite cut a disconnection from one another digitally, it has to be recreated. and refounded, but it's it's it's part of the, it's part of the flesh now, it has to be worked from and through that contradiction, it can't just be ignored. Yes, the solution is that we get all we all getted up, get ketted up and and just all have a giant chill down sesh, I think that's the key. All right, Somebody asks, this is a good last question, somebody asks what was the best movie of 2020? honestly, I don't know if I saw a movie in 2020 because I didn't see any movies in theater. 2020 and honestly without it even as a possibility I just haven't treated any movie I've seen like a movie, I really do think of it as a separate experience in the cinema everything's kind of blended together into one like vaguely disappointing streaming experience 20 joker was last year or 2019. people are saying first cow but i don't know man that seems like kind of a seems a little uh feels a little homeworky maybe crudes too maybe i have to watch that uncheck gems was 2019 too 2019 was a really good year for movie it was kind of a good sendoff year uh caped off of course by uh once upon a time in a hollywood which is fucking brilliant maybe that's fine maybe maybe movies are a different thing now vodville isn't a thing anymore there really isn't a like you cannot if you wanted to you couldn't really go out for a night and see a guy juggle which used to be able to do maybe movie maybe movies will be like the juggling guy or the fat guy getting shot with cannon special occasion things, and if that's the case, fine, but I think we will have lost something, and I will not really take these, I just won't give as much of my attention to these streaming movies, at least I hope not, because I think that that's only fair that I give it less attention and less emotional investment if it's going to be less special. Yeah, streaming is too individualistic, there's no group component, and really art is at its most, I think popular art is that it's most magical when it can be shared collectively, she's why movies are better than tv shows, damn it, they'll always be better, movies were better, we can say that, it's not just being. old men although of course part of it is that part of it is just being grumpy old men dang it get off of my digital lawn how about that get off my digital lawn bye
