 Okay, look at this youngish man, are halfway off with his pants, he's doing something w with his hands, it's got a multitud of outrageous plans and he's still trying to cough up, that what you choked on in the churches, look at him out running and run of a vacant store front, building and bedec an army surplus, why start giving? and a shit when everybody telling you it's full of it and then it gets suppressed obsessed and depressed and which one came first and this crazy mass and then he's taking too much or not enough and which one is the worst one with this sort of stuff and he's so important of being ignored but that's being ignored but I know it's nothing more than just being bored I know it's a lot more. just being bored, hi guys, my phone died yesterday, i didn't think i'd be able to stream, it wasn't charging, it wouldn't take a charge, but today i put it in, i said my prayers and it worked, so i'm able to bring myself to you once again, uh, how is everyone doing, i guess i want to say today rip to David Graybert who died in Venice, i guess, jesus, people are dropping man uh and it's a lot of good people and of course none of the bad um and I just want to say that like I didn't really know him, I never really interacted with him, I know he had a prickly reputation online and being a guy who argued a lot, but uh, but and of course I didn't agree with him on everything because he's an anarchist, but I I did read debt and I thought debt was in aggregate great, you can quibble all you want with some of the historical stuff, but uh, because you know he's not historian, he's an antropologi. but the anthropological work is really really important because I think the central the central element of uh of debt that I carry with me the most is his annihilation of the presiding myth of the rise of uh of currency of money the rise of of of like a denominated debt in social through into society and the Adamsmith neoliberal you know standard model that we all absorb at the level of a fucking DNA by the time we're two uh says that that arose because you had uh a situation where once societies got bigger once social orders became larger you had a situation where some people had stuff that other people needed had more stuff than they needed and there were other people who had stuff that they needed was it uh coinciding uh deficiencies or something I don't remember but it was a... to represent exchange that had previously been barter because that's how you do it if you have like a low level social uh complication is i have five chickens that equals three goats or something and that money came to represent that exchange and i think grab pretty ably dismantles that and says that is a that's a fiction that is that is a story that they tell themselves i mean it's as much of a it's as much a fiction as like the garden of eden it's like a parable that they made up to justify their ideology, their like religious uh, their religious faith, which is capitalism, capitalism is in their minds where religion is, had been in previous generations and it is in most of ours, we replaced God with capital in one way or another, and that's what they worship, and the story, the the the the Adam and Eve story of of that faith is, I got all these chickens, but no, goats and I got all these goats but no chickens. It's not true at all, gaber points outly shows that in tribal social orders, if there is a incongruity of of resources, like somebody has stuff that other people don't, they don't need a medium, they don't need a neutral medium of exchange or even an exchange of any kind, there is a social obligation understanding that is beyond the level of the transaction, that is beyond the level of individual acts, because labor hasn't been a alienated, labor is done for oneself and for others in equal amount, which means there's no alienation, alienation is when you are doing less for you and more for someone else, someone else, and it's usually owners or slave drivers or someone other than you, that's when people become separate from one another, that's when social obligations dissolve in the face of pain in the face of the desire for people to gain some sort of some sort of opiot, some sort of self. for the wounds of having their labor alienated, and and that's where you need to have a market transaction to exchange, because what's in it from? me becomes the only question, and so you have to have a neutral exchange, you can't have barter, you go straight to representation, because representation is all we have, we have the representation of social obligation that's been lost because of alienation, if you don't have that alienation, that social alienation, resource distribution is handled by ritualized, a almost biologically frictionless act of equal. the way that like a cell will equalize across its own membranes in order to maintain integrity and like the actual ritual mechanisms of those are different from society to society, but a lot of them are represented by things like the potlatch, which is the origin of our concept of a pot luck, which is a ritual of of the the distribution and annihilation of of surplus, so that it doesn't build up, because it can only build up if it's not being evenly distributed. and so all this stuff, the homo economicus view of humans as rational economic seekers, that's all that is a myth, that's a religious tradition, and it has a founding, it has a founding mythology, it has it has its own olympian traged, its own olympian tales and epic sagas and and birthing scenes and primal scenes and one of them is that first time that somebody needed to give a goat for a chicken, but if they knew each other, why would they have to have that exchange? one thing that great. points out really eloquently is that in in traditional societies it's actually rude to repay someone's debt entirely, every exchange should leave a little remainder, because that implies that there will be a continuing obligation between you. paying off a debt is closing that door and saying you are a stranger to me, and how could we have started like that? how could any civilization have existed for a fucking any viable amount of time if we really started off treating each other that way? It's impossible, the only thing you can argue is that the uh that that the only way to uh create the complex nodes that allow us to have a technological society that allow us to do things like have language or dang iphones or longer lifeespans that are less animalistic that allow us to develop culture to allow us to create things that give us the chance to reflect on ourselves and make ourselves aware of our moment and our place and time and space and our relationship to other people in a way that that we can't do even within the tribal society, because then there is an outside to fear always, can we not find that? and they say we get that way by by having a market, by by the engine of capitalism, and that's what builds this, that's what we get to live in. uh, no, that's not true at all, capitalism is the last manifestation of different regimes of resource extraction that come about because you have this un distributed sense of social solidarity, people don't see other people as themselves, so they have to find out what to think they are, and that can only be achieved through continued conflict, by continued interaction, and by continued domination of one over the other, because if they are not you, you can do what you want to them, if you want it bad enough, and people wanted things like the pyramids bad enough, and they wanted the southern continent to be a profitable. so they build this market to satisfy, and that's the last representation, you have to build a market after you've destroyed social bonds through exploitation, if you can't exploit people anymore, if the religious, if the religious um world that you have been able to exploit from the top to maintain a social coher. cohesion and social uh asedance to power, if that wears away, which it will over time as as as as social bonds are slowly and steadily and always pushed away from one another by cumulated uh trauma of class conflict. you will eventually snap the social bonds entirely and you have to replace them with something and you replace them with the liberal sense of self. we are individuals, we are equal, which means we can't just dominate and take from each other, we have to negotiate across that equal plane, but we are different and distant. and separate and always will be, and so the only way that we can organize a social intercourse is through a neutral medium of exchange, and that's true if you think that is immutable, if you think that's the only way we can we can relate to one another, and i don't think so, i think there is another turn of the screw, i think there's a turn of the screw where we are able to master enough the the technology that we have at our disposal to connect, and we utilize that to bring about through time, it wouldn't be easy, it wouldn't. of exploitation has bent them towards the same vision of justice broadly enough to allow them to cont to fight on the same side and in so doing overthrow the regime of exploitation, the world system that is that is contently controlled by by the ruling class, and i know that these are all slippery terms and that in the heat of the battle they will break one way or the other, but that's what history is for to grind that fucking pestal into that uh mortar, and then we see the results, the fucking the kernels spilling forth. and I think that through that process we can gain social awareness that is as powerful a self-regulator of behavior as tribal intimacy, but in a context of total uh technological uh uh control of nature, meaning that we would no longer destroy and defile nature, we would enter self-aware homeostasis with nature, and then the work of history, the real work of history could begin, the work of the human race as a conscious consciousness could begin, people have uh dinged me for saying that the dialect ends with the end of capitalism, if i got that, if i said that, i'm wrong, i didn't mean that, what i meant was is that the process of class conflict resolves and that level of a dialectical exchange is abolished over time, but that doesn't mean the dialect'. That's how we are going to figure out what to do once we think we realize we're we're a social organ and we have the ability to communicate off the across the the whole of of the planet through through the technology that we've accued and we were able to distribute the labor inputs necessary to maintain the system as evenly as possible so they fall as lightly on the shoulders of as many as possible then we will we will have to to manage this system, the steady state system and extend and and create things to do with it, what are we going to do with these powers? that's that's, but that process will also be a dialectical resolution, it will just not be through conflict, it will not be through social violence, because it will be one organism, but it's still a dialectical process and that's when we begin to make history, we are able to make history, and the only way a human really could, as part of one. because individually we fight against one another, we clam and bat and so much of our potential is wasted and annihilated in these matter aniner conflicts because we do not see the whole for the some of its parts. does that make sense? Anyway RAP Gravid Graber and his book dat deals very very uh skillfully and persuasively on that topic. uh, people keep uh, people keep asking me to engage sterner may more because they say that that actually i did don't disagree with it, and honestly it's like, well, if sterner is what i think it is, and i don't like it, but if sterner is what you're insisting it is, then i like it, and i guess i don't know why i got to read it, it's not like i can pass verdict on max sterner one way or the other, he is beyond my ability to judge or control, i certainly can't influence. in his reputation, oh what have I been grilling? uh, I grilled a few things, I grilled some burgs recently, uh, did some alotes, got those charred up uh, corn, corn's finally good, august, you get the night, august, early September, the corn's big, earlier this, when I started grilling the summer, corn was mad tiny, now got some thick corn, I'm hoping to do beyond burgers this weekend. going to have small friendly get together and have and not uh the patties, someone told me that the best beyond thing is the ground meat, like the ground beef, so I'm going to pack up some bergs, throw them on the grill, that's the plan, maybe do some seafood if I can find anything good, if sterner i, if sterner makes people and prim, then I'm afraid everything I think of him is correct, because of course i am Prim, if you're abolishing all these'. by resolving them amongst ourselves, there's no one else to answer to, there's no one else to to that's going to have answers but us, everything in the book is dead, everything written in a book is dead, but if the person's not here, it's all dead because we're just reckoning with the shadow of those ideas that we have to deal with, because it emates from the culture we we absorb them into, so we're already dealing with shadows, so we cannot get it from a book, we cannot get it from anyone else, in in singularity, we have to get it from an aggregate, we have to get it. we have to dis to get the thread of of of of of of harmony through through a crashendo of of of clashing notes, and we need structures to accommodate that, which means I'm sorry, we cannot bust all the ghosts, we have to use the ghosts to our uh control so that we can abolish finally our own ghosts, the only ghostworth busting, the ego. Mankind is so smart and stupid at the same time because we can never know what we don't know. It's frustrating to me that the duning crigger effect gets thrown around by reditors so much as like one of those dumb things that's that dumb can say sound smart, oh uh classic duning cruger effected, because i think that and i think that's because people don't really grasp what it means, they think oh yeah those guys they got that done and cruger effect, they don't realize that it is universally applicable, that no one by definition can be exempt from it, everyone doesn't know what they don't know, but somebody else might, and if you stack enough of them along the right questions by facilitating social interaction, by allowing people to to collaborate, which cannot happen in a capitalist framework, that is zero sum, especially now, they might say it's not, but they're lying, someone's labor is being extracted for someone else's benefit, and even if somebody gets to use somebody else's labor because they were able to buy like a cheap product on the market and they contributed to an exploitation, they are still also being exploited, there's there's wrong everywhere, they all reflect off of each other and and and echo'... until they create a social order that is becomes more and more frayed and thread bear and unviable. so the duning cruger effect is universal, no man, no woman, no anyone is spared, and the application, the implication there is clear to me, it means that. No political project, no religious project, no human project, no human social project, forget about politics, but also politics, no project of those kind can can and and and social and political project, culminating in a political project, because that is politics is the culmination of social projects, I would, I would, I would not want to be part of anyone, and I would not want to pursue anyone that took as its principle winning, reducing to... anything less and we will spin off into annihilation inevitably, we will not manage. the the crisis of the moment, it will not be an apocalypse, it will be a slow dying of the ember, it will be heat death until the last camp fire winks out and the people around that campfire, they don't think that they're a campfire at the end of the world, they think it's thursday and that they're they're at the corporate like HR training, they're doing the diversity workshop, they're reading right white frail to each other on the cabfire, and they think it's their job, they don't think it's it's it's a nightmare apocalypse that everyone has always been waiting to happen, because we will... ourselves into annihilation and we will never turn away from self-obliterating hostility to others that will then inevitably destroy us, so it's got to be as big as possible man, and and it's like there's people, and right now one of the really annoying things about and why the online left is not the left and it is, it's actually delaterious to the left. is that these arguments i keep talking about, the arguments that are that exist just to be had online, it's like there's two things, you have fun having the argument, like is luding good, have that argument all day, you have fun having the argument, uh, but then you also... get to split people into good and bad categories, who's on your side for the revolution? and right now, this fundamental reality as i keep hammering at because it's the only thing worth saying to me is that the left needs to actually consider its non-existence and move from that point instead of assuming a structure and a a center of gravity that would necessitate winning towards like the reason everyone seems to think, we need to like know the good for the bad as that go, what if they get in a position of power? they'll never get in a position of power. there is no positions of power to be a crued, and you really are afraid of every like 300 follower dip shit that you disagree with on twitter who's on a fucking subredit, you really think they're going to climb through the fucking corridors of power like stalin, when we're talking about a glacial process, they need we need bodies, warm motherfucking bodies and everything that is, every minute of energy that is expected. diving people up so so they can fill non-existent positions in some future fucking revolutionary vanguard party or or what government agency like you're arguing about like oh is dmchamsky going to be secretary of state i mean who the fuck and i mean and that means and the thing is any one on either side of the questions i'm talking about will there's will stiffen and they say, okay, but if we let anybody in, then I'm going to be kicked out by the other guy, like that's the that's the democratic uh, that's the democratic dilemma, right? it's like, I can't let the other guy win an election, buse then when he's in power, I will just be kicked out of the group, uh, I i will be denied my rights, you know, because I'm the one backing down and they're not, and that's kind of what voting is, and that's a trap of all democracies, is that you're saying, I will a seed to rule. by my enemy on the idea that they will if we if we vote, if I win, I get to be in charge, that's the that's the thing that makes it possible, um, and so they worry, they don't, they won't want to be the first one to back down, and the thing is someone has to be the first, that's the leap of faith, someone has to be first, it doesn't have to be one person on one side, it could be multiple people, but it's going to have to be a drawdown, someone is going to have to risk taking the hit of being the first, going to have to believe enough in the project to have that belief in the project make them willing to risk their own personal comfort by getting canceled by their side, they're going to have to do it, and then the thing is, you don't know what happens next, the other side might not back down, it might just, they might use it as a moment to destroy you, and that might happen, you have to take the risk, that's why it requires faith, but if they draw down two, you have a potential to disengage from this stand. and you have someone has to believe enough, and the reason we're in so much trouble is that nobody believes enough, that's why there's no left, at the end of the day it's because no one believes, and i'm including myself here, because what's to believe in, there's nothing, it's a field of pottage, but we have to build faith, we have to build faith in it so that we can care enough about the project, care enough about the vision we have to be willing to sacrifice, not just our reputations, but even our safety and lives. and of course twitter makes it worse because if the stakes are low it's easy to step down right? like if you're having an argument with a friend even if you really do disagree it's easier to step down than between you and a stranger and then even harder if there's people watching because you're less sure of the other party you can trust them less and that's so if the state are higher, it's harder to trust, and if the stakes are always reputations uh within a subgroup, jobs sometimes when you're talking about real significant like brigading attempts and cancelings, livelihoods like ability to continue, of course people aren't going to be able to back down, so the and people say, well what's going to happen then, what is the solution, and this is what a part of what is tough for me is i have to be honest and say this: solution will come at the precise moment when enough people have had enough of this bullshit to take to to either quit caring or recommit themselves and like grind their their ego against the wheatstone of the of their understanding of the crisis we're we're in and the imperatives of it, all of which is driven by love, love, we're going to have to fucking love enough, god i know that sounds incredibly dorky, that is the cringest thing of ever. said, but motherfucker, it's true, we're going to have to love enough to be willing to take the fucking risk to to be willing to do a thing that we don't know is going to work. because that's the only way we can convince people now to sacrifice is that it'll do something, because that's what then they can satisfy their ego, their libido. the only way they're going to do something that won't work is if they know that in the long run it's something someone has to do first, even if it isn't going to work, like John brown, people fixate on John brown, but no one can be him, even though that is what we need, he loved so much john brown that the enormity of the... crime that he saw in front of him over overwhelmed his sense of propriety because he didn't what he was going to die? what did that mean? what was his life to this? what was his life compared to this? if considering how deeply he loved, how much his love, like i've said is ego directed outward and attached to others and removed from the self, how could he ever value his mortal life for a soul? buse that's what we're talking about is the fucking human. human soul is the degree to which your love reaches out beyond yourself and he had and his and that means it doesn't just reach out, it empties, it empties out, and John brown, he had enough soul that he didn't, he wasn't afraid to die, we're afraid to get dragged for an afternoon, and it's not our fault, ability to have faith has been ground out of us by the alienating brutality of the lives we've been thrust into, but at some point we're all going to take enough and and the old solutions aren't going to work and we're going to have to break through, and I'm saying that the thing I'm saying is how do we make this happen? We don't make this happen, it just it happens because people get to the point where nothing else works, and what I say works, you can keep doing something that doesn't work for. if it's getting you off, and for some people, it'll always get them off, you know the people i'm talking about, perpetual emotion machine people, just live in the internet and they're entirely consumed by the hydonic treadmill of owns and counter owns and they love it and they addicted to it, they are the people who fight you with a fucking fireplace poker if you try to pull them away from the fucking cave uh cave flame shadows, you can't deal with that, i'm saying is that the... will be a time when enough people see the failure of what they're doing to help and seeing the things get worse and seeing their lives get worse and seeing the lives of the people they love getting worse and they will react by instead of pulling inward and a lot of people are going to react by pulling inward and saying well this is this is the doomsday scenario i need to hoard as much pleasure for myself as i can. i cannot afford i have to do self care because it's coming to an end and that thing is that's the rational response if we act like libertarians think humans act, that will be where we end up, crouching into ourselves and then fighting over the last mcnugget in the after spear, but not all of us are going to do that, and the and the hope is is that enough of people exist like that, you will make that choice at the right moment to start reversing this trend, and i don't know if it'l have. that's where we get like and people say, well now where's your dialectic now, where's your historical materialism now, this is essentially the quantum level of politics, this is the quantum level of history, this is where history happens, this is where events are kindled, because in every moment every human being decides to do something, because they don't know why they're doing anything, and they can make a choice in any moment, and if enough of them decide to do something, it happens. the social existence is predicated on that, you see it working and you keep doing it, but it's harder to see things as society gets more complicated, so you have to create symbolic systems to represent that, to represent the sense of security, the sense that advancing the aims of others advances your aims, but that runs against the current of accumulating social structures requiring labor, and labor being distributed down on the on the bottom side of the curve towards control over resources, control over symbols, ability to manipulate symbols, the priestly classes, and you can look at the arc of history and after it happens, you can look back and see in perfect amber why everything happened, but in the moment, anything can happen, it really is true, and that's the quantum moment of history, and we're living in it, and that is the problem with dialectical materialism is that it eventually runs into a quickness of moment. a hugeness of probabilities that are so much more than can be managed by the the equipment of human rationality uh compared to the like shat. fragmented model train version of the past that we look at, like when we examine the past dialectically and materially, we're looking at a little tiny train set, like a fucking lionel guy going around, even the most even our most even our most uh small grained you know like social history at the at the ground level, the grass roots, this kind of stuff that they got into in like the 90s when history turned away from big questions and towards micro history. even if you were able to get that entirely fucking mapped out uh to the ability that you could as a discipline, you're still talking about a linal train, history being lived is being strapped to the top of a fucking bullet train going from the Shanghai airport to downtown with a nuclear weapon at the tip, and so we can only just grab on and pray and see what happens. Once again, I hope that made sense, and somebody says, well, isn't that just accelerationism, isn't that just quietism? No sir, it means you got to throw theory away, it means you got to stop arguing these points. It means you have to stop tending time, tending your opinions, your precious little opinions, building your little ship in a bottle of opinions, oh look at my little opinion bottle, oh it'll go, oh it'll go across the sea to Thomas More's utopia, you got to smash that motherfucker, buse it means shit now, because the speed and size is too much for you to comprehend by yourself, we have to get together, we have to bring together these fucking consciousness to to signal boost our ability to examine the moment and coordinate action, that means we have to throw it. away, we got to throw it all away, and I'm not saying do it right now, because it's impossible, but you have to smash the idol, you could do it while you're on the toilet, you can do it ball of steam, but you have to throw it down and then you have to ask yourself, with this hole now, with my my animale, my orgon hole, my fucking my throbbing libido hole, now empty, what am i going to fill it with? am i going to convince myself that self care is revolutionary, or am i going to try to fill it with action that seems like it's moving me towards some? think because i can see it with other people, i can compare fucking notes. all this stuff feels like black pill if you have completely consigned the idea that you can derive any soul satisfaction, any tending to the garden of love for others politically uh, other than the internet or that the internet can provide even a even a little potted plant, it can't, it's fucking salted earth, and that doesn't mean you can't do it, but it means you have to consign it to the to the realm of recreation, and you'll find you can't do it as much because you're not getting the other out of it, you're not getting the sense of of of, you're you're not satisfying in some part of your mind that the imperative to try to make things better in the world, you know you're not. "you got to just be man, you got to go out there and you got to fucking try something, and and now it breaks down again, because once again we've tunneled beyond my site, we've tunneld to the quantum level, individual level, I don't know what your life is, I don't know what your capacities are, I don't know what your abilities are, and I don't know what your social situation is, I don't know where you are, uh, what your job is, I don't know what your family situation is, I don't know where you are visavy capital or or anything, other questions, you know that." you don't know all about it, but you know more than me, and other people around you know more than me too, and on that quantum question we can only know by asking, and that's scary, and it potentially makes us have a bad time, and when we're self-directed, when we're ego and idirected, we are only going between good and bad times, we're swalloming between good and bad times, because all we have are our moments of pleasure, and we know the and they're going away and they're on the and at some point they're gone, it's going out of business sale, being a human. in every moment, your supermarket sweep, every moment of your life as a human is grabbing as much, pile it up, people say, why do they need so much, because they know it's going away, and so that goils down to even like a nice afternoon, like posting online versus phone banking, which one would be more fun in terms of uh satisfying the the libido? uh, that's an easy fucking question, if you can answer false. to yourself, well posting is just as good, that's where the self-deception at the heart of of sin is, it's not, that's why we're forgiving. for sin because we don't even know we're doing it, our brain is doing it for us, it's below the level of our understanding, that's why we should be able to forgive ourselves, not to like people do anything and have people have to show a track record to be trusted, because trust has to be reinforced, it can't be stripped out, it's the only way to reinforce the the the positive feedback loops that will get someone to this point that will get enough people that will kickstart the fucking motor, so And the thing is, I probably not going to do that, because I can probably convince myself that what I'm doing now matters more than like doing something that is less libidinally satisfying, because I've got a brain capable of that, uh, what's going to bring me down to earth will be my interactions with the world and other people, and that will either allow me to sit there or bring me down, and I don't know where I will end up because I don't know what the answer is, I can't, because I don't know. only interacting with other people would drag me down, and more the reason i say that more than anything is is that if your answer to this is easy for you to say podcast man, my answer is yes easy for me to say literally, i'm sitting here in front of you as part of like a media career being reinforced with constant stream of of uh of of positive reinforcement, but it's like a i might as well be in a fucking matrix vanch sucking in nutrients. and that might be true, but it doesn't mean what I said isn't true, and you got to ask yourself, am I saying, look at him, easy for him to say, because that answers the question that he's posing, or am I doing that instead of really, really asking because I don't want to know the answer, and that's another question, like the question of what to do that I can't know, and so I got to do shruggy emoji man, wo oh man that was wow that's over an hour isn't it shit uh well tomorrow we're gonna try to do an office stream we're gonna see if we can get it to work i'm very excited about it because me and chris are gonna be in the lab in the beat laboratory soon it's going to be a lot of fun and like i said this will still exist i will never enough to stream of consciousness madness into your face, but then afterwards maybe we have some Q&A, maybe we have a guest, maybe we place a video games, so your favorite, your favorite um uh jabbering madness will continue until moral improves, uh, if anybody uh, it's only been 40 minutes, oh I started at five. i lost i i usually start at six and then at the end of that i looked out i forgot i started at 5ive today, never mind, that's why i was kind of like shocked because it didn't feel that long, now i know why. Will I watch the last episode of the Simpsons? Yes, I haven't seen the Simpsons, I haven't seen a new Simpsons episode in years, I think. I generally try to watch the tree house of horror. I honestly think I might be a couple years behind though, I check Hulu. Or I guess it's FX now uh, but I will definitely watch the last one, if I'm alive for it, which is a big if. I mean, I could definitely die before the Simpsons ends for any number of reasons. Yeah, apparently somebody on twitter said that uh, a dude who works like teaches an ivy was stealing my bars to spit at a at a lady, uh, that's i don't know what to think of that, honestly, it does make me imagine a uh, an alternative world where I was a mystery style peek pickup artist, which I think could have been a fun. but no, not for me, not for me that life, COVID is definitely exacerbating the posting issue, uh, but we also see how there is like there's a flip side to that, right? because people get more into posting, but also the more that they are kept away from like what the... used to consider normal cuz things are normalizing but not completely and not evenly uh the longer they feel that way the more tense they feel and the less computer can like satisfy them it it it exacerbates the person stress that leads to the explosion buse like everyone's going to have to come to a point where their personal stress and their perception of social stress are over is larger than the amount of pleasure they can convince themselves they can get out of posting um and obviously that's going to be unevenly distributed and they're going to be people who are going the people are going to be hardest to fucking fight the ones are going to hold on the longest everyone's not me, they're abstractly good, why? because if people are nice to each other, they can cooperate and cooperation is better for human progress than the alternative, that's really what they believe, and it's like they don't think that, they think themselves as having deep moral beliefs, but at a level that they aren't even aware of the, their liberal conception of the self is such that they have no moaring for their conviction that other people believe equally, like that's the heart, that's the true thing that people say about... about liberals of godless liberalism, like the the the notion of a secular society uh, that is a true uh uh indictment uh, and it doesn't mean anything because that you need that for like we live in a liberal world, we need that as a basis, we can't have a religious sectarian in in a world where religion is sectional, we cannot have sectarian ethics, it is not sustainable, it has to be secular, it has to be liberal, because that's everyone is somebody else and we have to negotiate living here, that's the real uh principle it place, those people are living with old ideas, those people are literally in pre-modern notions of of uh of good and evil uh and and of humanity and and we were like if one is not redeemed within one religious tradition one is one is someone that things can be done to that is the condition to be in a pre-modern religion uh when we hadn't had the technological development to create a a exchange, to necessitate exchange across enough uh areas of distrust that we had to put our weapons down to not destroy one another, and you could just take anything you wanted if you were more powerful than the other person and where your social belief, like the intensity of your social belief determined in part your or maybe even in total, i mean relative to your material conditions of course, your strength and your ability to to control things and therefore your ability. to save the world and redeem it against something that is someone that you can do things too, and that's also where you can then offload social tension and pressure by destroying and and conquering another. liberalism when that's not sustainable because we have a global communications and we have a technological level that allows us to destroy one another completely in war, it's not like a uh you know it's not cyclical like old wars, it's cumulative, it's not like the flower wars, it might be bloody and horrible, but they don't wreck the ability of the people there who live with. them to sustain themselves, modern warfare creates even even even early modern warfare is is far too dangerous to human thurishing to be allowed to go unchecked and and the liberal model allows us to do that, but there's no religious foundation to it, there is no, there's no connection from one to the other in it, the connection is severed because now we're in a market and we're separate people and we are not connected, and that has to be replaced, and and it's replaced by our ability to create ourselves through consumption. That's where we build our souls, but at the level of ethics, it really does come down to viewing them as utilitarianism because it's the it is the ideology of capitalism, which means it's the ideology of profit, surplus profit consump or extraction, and so therefore it's guiding moral principle, it's programming is efficiency to get the most off the bone, and the process of capitalizing a society and lising a world market is to create a efficient system for extraction. now it's not going to be fully efficient because society is like the gunk and the filter, and it's and it and it reduces the amount you can do, but you work against that, you grind against that too, to create premium efficiency, and so liberalism is religious, it's religious worship is efficiency, efficiency of exchange between others, because we are all only ourselves, we are not each other, and the end result of that. is an ethic that says um oh is an ethic that says i care about other people but really at heart it's because because it's most efficient to love them, and when that's and that could be good, people can act in sincere good will out of that desire. problem is if it comes under pressure, if it comes under pressure, especially since there's no felt personal discomfort, that their lives are comfortable, that all of their pain associated with the condition is theoretical and felt and imagine in their head and imagine the connection to people aren't them. then it's fragile and it can come crammbling down, crumbling down, crammbling, crumbling down if uh the only thing being served is the self, because you can decide that well, you know, oh well, or you can say, you know what, posting is doing the work, even though you never see it rewarded, or you know what, those guys don't actually deserve it, and these ones don't too, and oh, yep, you know what, and by the way, none of it's ever going to happen anyway, we'll never have socialism, we just need to punish people right now for the crimes they've committed, the only justice we're going to have is like as the ship's going down like shooting the captain for running into the iceberg, that's our only justice is vengeance with just nialistic vengeance, and we can just post, post or uh, you know, refuse to step down, no matter what happens. on the other end, you have people who feel intense personal angst and pressure and pain, whose family conditions are very very bad. now there's fewer of them because people like that generally don't have the ability or time to post as much. so they can't even get anything out of it, but the ones who are, their distress can cause them to privilege their the relief of their own suffering, and there's no way you can blame them for that, because it's their suffering, and everyone else is his imaginary. the way that you coordinate a class awakening into itself is bringing those ideas together, across the casm, bringing, bringing together a felt sense of the right and of good to a social sense of the right and the good that are in a and that flow across one another, because over time that will make suffering, not your own, and and the suffering of others will replace that, because you're suffering less, because your personal suffering has been been relieved to an extent, because you're not fighting your conditions, and it's like that sucks because it's asking people to sacrifice the way other people don't have to, and that's unfair. but sadly that's also unavoidable, what we need, the idea is that there are enough people in the middle, there are enough people who suffer a good deal, but still have a social connection because they have a spirituality, and enough people who don't have much spirituality because it's been eroded away by pleasure, but do have a social sense and connect them, that's the only future, that's the only engine, and basically what I just described, those two sectors of people, the top sector, I'm mostly describing the dreaded PMC, make up pretty much everybody arguing on Twitter, in some way or another, including people who hate them, including people who fight them all day, they're in the top half of that distribution of paint, the bottom half are disengaged from politics for the most part, and the one who aren't are often oriented along reactionary uh uh mindsets because they are. are filled with justified anger at the way that their life is going, and right, and and historically what happens is is that you have enough, you essentially have enough of an elite overproduction, like 1848 is a good example of this, the the 1848 election rebellions were were kicked off because you had an elite overproduction of of college graduates who were just hanging around these cities and just getting ancy because they weren't getting the condition, they weren't their lives weren't what they wanted. to me, but they were not the misery of the lives of you know the the spinners and the weavers and the early proletarians or or is backbreaking and isolated as the wor is working in the peasant uh uh in peasant agriculture in the land and they had enough time to sit around and and talk between themselves and to other people including those workers about what was going on and they formulated an understanding of what was actually happening and they communicated across this narrow social casm cuz remember this is pre pre-modern i mean this is precapitalism really it's still like it's capitalism but it's embedded still within feudalism feudalism has not been annihilated by any stretch yet remnants are still the structure of the thing is a bit and it meaning there's a there's a social basis for interaction that is that is still not been dissolved by the market completely and that means crossing that casm is easier there's less mistrust there's more social comingling we're in a situation now where that conveyor belt but between those two classes has been broken, and I don't know how to mend it, this is where we're at the quantum point, like if the van belt is busted and it's snapped and you can't. get another one, you just got to glue that motherfucker, like everybody has to just close their eyes and turn into a glue and just grab that motherfucker and an active faith and then just hope it holds until you can kickstart the fucking motor, i know that sounds like a bunch of mystical hogwash, and it probably is, and it's not really worth thinking about from day to day, and i'll probably not talk about it more in the future, but um, it's how i think of the question in front of us, that's it's like when i talk about it, i try not to get that wo, about it, but this is the this is the shape of the question, how to repair that belt? oh man, i don't know if we'll do another call of kathu for a while. the the colicula games are a lot of work and i think uh virgil is uh is he's operating at that very high and intense frequency right now i don't he's got a little on his he's got a lot on his plate creatively but i would it might happen there's just nothing planned oh i've never tried to pick anyone up someone but some picking lines, i've never tried to pick anyone up, seems like an incredibly awkward moment, with soup practice, oh yes, certainly eating it is anyway. if you get a nice stone soup going, everybody brings one ingredient and boom, you have a stew, someone's people are really mad at this mug, i think we got it a target, it was just i it's a nice design, i guess this is kind of like for some people this is basically the confederate flag, that's a strong argument, it's i'm not trying to make a message, this is not a spacy message, i'm not trying to indicate that i'm like, i'm i'm an mi68 asset. I'm here from the I'm I'm here on the mission of the queen to sew disinformation uh on American airwaves uh to defend uh to protect the queen against accusations of episten related crimes. We did a reading series uh today, someone asked what happened to reading series uh, I guess there just haven't been a lot, the takes during a presidential election are generally pretty repetitive and and boring, you got to have sort of a slack political environment for people to start just riffing, so you generally have less during a political uh, I think during the during the meet of a political, especially this one since it's such, it's Trump again and it's a lot of the same stuff. It's not the same exact arguments and anxieties, but we have one today and I think it's pretty good, I it's uh, it's Matty G or Matty Y, Matty YG, Mattie iglesius, man, the man is uh, his heart pump coolaid, as they say, for you are neither hot nor cold, but look warm and I should spew you out of my mouth. He is, he is nichi's last man, I don't know what the Beldin program is, uh, brace is not shared it with me yet, but I whole-heartedly endorse it, I'm not kidding, if uh, if Brace is serious about running for president of the left, uh, I have, he has my full support, uh, I will, I would absolut happily betrusky. to his lenin uh or uh maybe i could be uh stalin, we'll see how it goes, but i think maybe Liz is stalling honestly uh, but yes, no, he's, I have never seen a, I've never seen a brace take on politics that I disagreed with, like his he, he, he gets the terms, he gets the problems, he gets the set of issues, he understands the bad actors, he understands the pathologies, he knows where the material intersects with the cultural, he knows which way the flow goes, "if he wants to tell everyone what to do, I would help him, and in fact, I wouldn't even have to help him, I would just happily live under his reign or and help move towards the upholding of Belden thought. Yeah, Liz is Stalin, I'm trotsky, yeah, and Lenin is uh, brace is my boy, he's vi lenin all over the place. I don't know when we're going to do the George W. Bush episode, it might, it might be a bit, there, you got to get warned that we often will say we should do an episode and then it ends up not getting done because you kind of need to have like a hole in your calendar to fill to to go to the back catalog and sometimes you go a while without having one but i think maybe in the next month or two anyone that requires any kind of work is always harder but i think now that Felix is red uh fortunate son i think it was or family of secrets i think we'll uh i think we'll get it done in pretty soon we're also going to me and will felix are also going to do the richard jewel movie episode. which i'm looking forward to because i think that movie, i thought that movie was genius when i saw it, and since i've been thinking in the years since, it's only more on point. i don't think felix finished the canals card guys, i know he left one canals card book on a like a public transit in Europe or something, i don't think he finished. i think he really appreciated the idea of it and then he didn't need to read it if you know what i mean? i said the year since dickhead, someone saying the years since, i saw it said years since, if you heard years, that's a yp, not an mp. i lost my religion there for a second, but these trolls are just so chillish, what? why must you insist on being so disagreeable on such a fine day? it is a fine September day indeed and I do not see the need for being quite so argumentative in the comment section, but I understand it is my responsibility to rise above the frey and provide a bit of elegance and and maturity frankly. So I, I bid you your day sir. people keep talking about a realignment, I don't want to think, this is gonna uh, maybe I shouldn't say it honestly, I don't want to get in trouble, but let me just say this, I won't elaborate, but it feels like if people say that there's going to be there might be, if biden wins especially, a uh a realignment politically uh, I mean, "the last couple of polls have shown that Biden's lead among Hispanics and uh and blacks is reducing, going below historic norms for the party, which of course makes people incredulous, because the one thing they've been attacking Trump on for his entire candidacy has been how racist he is, that's been the number one issue for liberals, the people who dominate the discourse, and this and uh have the the fartest tendral." into the minds of the popular potential voting base in this country, but if Biden wins, it will be because if these trends are real, but it has been a few polls, it's not just one, if he wins this way, it'll be because a big chunk of suburban affluent whites go democrat, which is what they're pitching their whole campaign around, that has been the entire point is to do that, that dynamic under the pressure of a fucking depression presidency that he's going to respond with fucking means tested uh uh horse piss, that's going to be that pressure is going to be exacerbated, and if the pressure of living in in in like under a democrat with this kind of social conditions exacerbates even, not even evenly, but just somewhat near a a a equilibrium of distribution between democratic voters and republican voters. you could see Q swell just in time to like break off from the barnacle like uh holding restraints of the democratic of the republican party machinery and connect blob like to the alienated uh democratic working class base and then coming together leaving the two shards of of ruling class and and like upper middle class comparador class. whatever you want to call it uh uh uh uh separate, that's the dream, i don't think that will happen. I don't think that there's any reason or way honestly to act like that's going to happen and why I'm saying like right now the premise has to be action so that means if it's not actionable it's sort of just forget about it it's interesting to think about but it shouldn't drive your thinking I don't think we're there yet but if it does happen I think that's the only way it happens is if like RFK RFK junior is the synthesis character like if RFK Jr. I know Sean Mccarthy said this uh on Twitter and I think that is dead on. If this were to happen RFK Jr. would be the Napoleon. Napoleon the third of course uh who like brings together this like dis aggregated alienation and becomes the figure head representation of it. But I think as you hear me describe this that doesn't seem terribly plausible. Now that doesn't mean it's not going to happen. We've seen a lot of implausible things happen recently, but I think those are the... conditions that as you work through your life on other things, look out for it and see if that comes come comes more or less likely over time because it'll be interesting to see. i think it's a whole different ball game if Trump wins though, if Trump wins you could see Q become like a hardened almost paramilitary extension of the republican party and like the greater uh like white uh like white lumpion bourgeois that they represent. and like small producers at the top, like not the high levels of capital, but like local levels, the the modern equivalents of the guys wh made up the early uh uh the people who picked taft in 52 and got and got uh and had the nomination stolen by the eastern bankers in Eisenhower uh and then then they become like the... ones that then become, I would think you'd see more organized violence from Q, because they would feel they would have the imperature of state, because the state would turn to them to help help help their power be consolidated in a moment of prolonge crisis, because we're we're talking Trump second term, we're talking siren crisis at every moment, an intensification, a cranking, an upward cranking only, no downward cranking, biden we might see some slack in the line for a little bit, Trump stays in because that's his thing is is is antagonizing the contradictions, he's banging the dinner bell. every single day, so it can only get worse, and that means there will be more dissatisfaction, more discontent, more violence, and then that violence will be organized, along who's in power. now, the question then becomes, will the left in that situation be constrained by the Democratic party, or finally provide, become like the guiding force of a movement, a larger working class movement to shatter and destroy the democratic party and replace it, and send it's it's it's ruling elite scattering back to the de to the scattering to the republicans or more likely to the private sec uh sector and then those those uh connections to global finance being shifted of course over to the conservatives to the republicans to mega and that's the apocalyptic confrontation and that seems more likely in the trump. version of this, of course all of this is assuming that conditions don't change, like a vaccine could radically shit change things or not, like there are market, there are inconceivable market bubbles that could pop and bubble and plorp, there's events, there's fucking there's too many butterflies flapping too many wings to say definitively one way or the other, i'm just sort of gaming it out in my head uh and just once again emphasizing that that that level of abstraction you really don't have to concern yourself when you're asking the question what did i do today? with myself, you can talk about, you can think about it and talk about it as a recreation when you're done doing what you think you needed to do that day, but you got to do that first, and that doesn't really connect to that, that's still mostly a question, an argument you have just to have an argument, which is what i said is the driving force for all this stuff that we turn into real meaningful points of discussion and and difference and separation. it's very fun. so Trump's clearly going to lie about the vaccine thing, but they're not going to get a vaccine, like what's he going to do, is he going to do like some pilot program, like a photo op with somebody getting a salline vaccine and in in uh like in in a in like dallas somewhere, like that uh the vodoo, like the the demon seed lady is is injecting some guy with a like a hydrochloriquine vaccinated cock cocktail that's actually diet fanta, would be diabolical, because there's no way they would actually be able to get it out to people to actually have in time, and honestly i feel like Trump at this point, who's going to buy that, who's going to go, who's going to be on the fence, i guess? this is my question, who is going to be on the fence in late October who's going to hear Trump saying, there's going to be a vaccine and go, well, I think he might have a vaccine, I'm not sure, but I think he will, and then voting for him because, oh, we might have a vaccied, if at that point, if you've by late October, you've probably decided Trump was full of shit, even if you are still thinking you might vote for him because he's less full of shit than the democrats, which... hey, when you have Biden as your opponent, when you have Nancy Pelosi, when you have Nancy Pelosi going getting fucking lucile Blooted, getting caught going to a salon indoor so she can get her fucking hair done for $500, and then she says, I'm sorry I got set up by those bitch ass motherfuckers at the salon, come on, it's it's plausible, but you still don't believe him, you don't think he's got a fucking vaccine, come on, and so it's not going to be why you pick is what I'm saying. so no one's going to pick on that, but they don't know that, they're just bitting every button they can, carnival barker style, trying to get the last money out of the rubes before they fucking realize that the uh that the spinning wheel is rigged, i will end with this uh i said something that seem might maybe might feel find a spiritual blah blah blah about how everyone it's going to come down to whether enough people do a thing, well it ends with them like snapping too, but the first step is an action, it's action always comes first, because the unmoved moving action is the one that is induced by you convincing yourself of something of you having enough faith to move forward, and that comes before, but that's not. real, it can't be analyzed, it's gossimer, so the action has to come first, always, so enough people are going to act enough to start the snowballing effect, where they're not, not saying the process will stop, it'll just there won't be enough in time as conditions as the conditions of social deterioration uh render impossible any unity. and i don't think that's going to happen guys, i really don't, i'm not going to get into why now, but i really, i really don't think so, so i think if we all over it to ourselves to push, to push forward in any way we can. bye guys.
