 Oh shit, don't you care anymore what you say buse is my life, go ahead with your own life, leave me alone, don't forget that you're a victim of circumstance, I never met to be the victim of your romance, I so go on, don't get me wrong, but you can speak your mind, but not on my time, I don't care anymore what you see cuz it's my life, go ahead with your own life, leave me alone. William Joel, sir William Joel, I believe he's been nited, one of the best to ever do it, and by it, I mean right, incredibly cheesy and insanely hostile and uh, um, narcissistic songs, uh, that weirdly over-rely on cheezy uh, sound effects, uh, William Joel, Billy Joel is about the only contemporary like uh, songwriter of any note popular. in popular culture to you know before hip-hop i guess to consistently put little sound effects in his songs like little making literal the fucking content of the song like uh moving out with the room room at the end or there's one with the tv starts like dude come on man people it's a song people know what's happening it's so funny because you'd think it would make his work specifically and exclusively or i mean uh suitable to the uh what do you call it uh the god damn it uh to the jukebox musical that's what i was thinking and there was a bbox musical called moving out uh twarp did the choreography and i believe it was a one season flop which is like i said amazing buse his songs are many of them are stories uh he loves peopling them with that kind of you know uh theater uh uh theater style elements, theatrical elements, i kind of wonder, i mean i never saw it obviously, but i kind of wonder if it flopped in part because any protagonist like imagine the main character in a play where he's got to sing Billy Joel songs like every 10 minutes, imagine what an absolute fucking douche bag that character would be, every song by Billy Joel is somebody saying fuck you, I'm cool, you suck or trying to excalculate or demand something of someone else, don't go changing to try to save me, oh if that's what you call moving on, well I'm moving on, hey, good luck in the suburbs, uh, here I am in the piano and they're asking me, man, what are you doing here, it's like, god damn, this guy is a fucking smug and hostile prick, and I'm assuming the characters uh, the main character in the show was as well, I don't know, probably never going to see it, but whatever, some of the songs are still pretty goddamn catchy. Okay, have I talked to you guys about the white noise thing yet? because I really think this is really interesting, so if you guys know anything about the movie bizs, right now, one of the hottest uh, power couples in in creative end of hollywood is no bamba uh uh uh Felix's least favorite director uh and uh uh gretta gerwig his uh younger female uh paramor uh it's funny Noah Bomback is is like the dark Alexander Paine for Felix because Felix loves Alexander Paine and he hates Bomback and I honestly think part of the reason comes down to the fact that Bomback is actually Jewish and uh Alexander Paine is a mid-western Greek guy which means he's... kind basically Jewish in that his relationship to like uh mid Midamerican milleu is like similarly alienated but it's not quite the same thing which means for you know someone who's inmerstian jewishness their whole life less maybe annoying uh so anyway he hates bomback but so Bomback has been making these Netflix movies for a while now he's he's he's on the creative end of the lost leader ledger for Netflix we've got bomback the guy you made you know movies like uh like Marco. the wedding and the squid and the whale, middle brow, middle brow classics at the very tail end of uh independent theater as a concept and in those early days was married to uh celebrated and talented actress Jennifer Jason uh Lee uh but they had affair I believe in part because he cheated on her with Gretta Gerway if not he cheated on her with somebody for sure uh and then he ended up making a movie about it marriage story uh and hooking up with Gretta Gerwick and together they've collaborated on a couple of movies she's like his younger protege uh and also uh wife I guess or girlfriend, i don't know, but so they both uh indie people, you came out of those those moderate budgeted movies that uh existed on the margins of the big big uh studios and we're meant to you know gobble up make enough money for investors but we're not supposed to be huge ledger items, but of course that whole economy has been swamped by quantitative easing more than anything, i mean we talked about it at the end of last week about how uh the the final uh time fix to the crisis of capitalism now is in quantitative easing from the federal reserve and what that means is now there's so much money circulating that profits have to be massive to justify investments and because investments are massive because there's nowhere else to put it so it's just molandering through the system so these guys all get squashed out but so he got to enjoy sort of the apagy of that like i said squiding the way on mark at the at the wedding these movies played in theaters i went and saw them in theaters uh they were talked about by uh cogningency and literati. younger of course comes in a little later, she gets a few of those before she ends up getting swallowed by the same economy he does, and so I honestly, I think because gender plays a role, but also the generational thing, Bolmback had longer to establish his name as like a brand, they are now both at the two ends of the stick of like uh, the creative in Hollywood now, the the the filmmaker at least, uh, film runner, show runner, whatever or uh, so if you're a filmmaker with any kind of cloud in the industry, your choices are, you can make shit on Netflix that will never get seen by or talked about, seen by anyone or talked about by anyone, some people will watch it while they're on their phones or folding laundry, they might tweet about it a little bit, it might get a little bit of meme rubbige, but that conversational, the thing you went into it for basically to be someone that people talk about, you know, what are the thing that that? fuels the egos of filmmakers, that's gone, but they'll give you creative freedom, because they're just signing checks, they're just an algorithm that's making decisions, you don't have studio executives and people thinking that they actually have a role, and of course creatives hate those people, but we know now from the netflix example that some pushback requires filmers to get more ingenious and to like look at their film and address it critically in a way that they wouldn't otherwise and makes in general for b movie, not always when you got a fucking harvey winesteen chopping up movies left and right uh, but just something, some friction is good, when we we see instead is now bomback is over there like fucking colonel Kurts having spent $140 million dollars on a adaptation of white noise, which is a movie that takes place entirely uh in and around a fucking college campus in the midwest. so that is where you end up, you end up in the creative weeds. trying to hack something out of just this big blob of money on a streaming service, or if you're a little late to the game and maybe a woman, uh, you are, if you're great gerwig, uh, you get to make a smart, thoughtful, uh, you know, subversive, actually version of Barbie, you get to do ip for a studio, those are your two options. That's that's where you get to go, there's no other place, like the best case scenario now is not that you get to make a movie and then you get people see it and have every step of that process part of a careful deliberative uh winning into you know the heightest the heightest amount of clarity of purpose and meaning instead it's people just browning in a sea of money or it's you being... creatively strangled by the ip shackles that are required to get anything else made for any significant outside of the streaming economy, and of course the bomb deal is running out, he's probably going to be one of the last guys to get that deal, the barn, they're closing, they're piss, they're calling in the fucking dogs for this shit and um, because they're finally cranking down on the money supply, they're finally applying some fucking uh, they're applying. some uh friction to the market, they're they're tapping the brakes a little bit, and so the first things they're going to get stress tested are these things where there is not even any theoretical money where it's just a... build the technology uh and capacity play where where profit is out the window, which is only the possible because of q quantitative easing and applies to things like Netflix and fucking um Netflix more than anything, but also like lift and stuff, those guys are in trouble. Tesla, they had to sell their bitcoin and loss to show uh positive cash flow for the quarter, which is a big eyebrow razer uh... but the most vulnerable of all is Netflix because it doesn't really have anything all that's it's it's value add now hey we're going to create this like streaming capacity has now been absorbed by people who have ip like Disney or Warners uh tech like uh amazon or uh a just basically a domination of the personal computing space in such a way that their profit flows elsewhere are such that they could throw money down that hole forever because uh, I don't know how many people know this, but for the last decade or so, uh, Apple has just been sitting on a trillion of trillions of dollars if they can't settle anywhere, because there's nowhere that it'll be worth it to put in an investment versus what they're going to cost in taxes and so they're just looking for places to write off money and apple plus is part of that and so they're going to be able to hang around forever, but netflix has nothing, they frantically spent zillions of dollars to build a catalog, but they're just so far behind the appal compared to the other ip holders that they were never going to do it, but part of the strategy was get quality names and give them all the money they want, which is just like letting kids eat fucking sugar for every meal, their teeth rot out, there's a couple of people who use the maximalist format in the indulgence well, like there's a reason is one of the greatest, obviously, and it is that they could be like, oh these insane idiots will give me all the money i want, all right, i'm going to use it to uh to utilize special. effects technology in such a way to intentionally alienate the myself from the audience of this picture, to make them be pulled out of space and time to be intentionally alienated in a brechian sense from what is being watched and that is astounding is that you have $160 million dollar exercise in brachthian alienation, that's what the Irishman was. That's becuse he is the king. Uh, he's very, very talented, he's a genius, even in his late uh... he's almost 80 years old uh now a lot of people say scorsezy he's a middle brow choice for best uh picture or best director and that's what i say hey well first of all he's in the conversation for me but the reason he's in the conversation for me is hey idiot film is a middle brown genre the more capital it takes to make a piece of art the less art is in it you can put it on a fucking trackboard and anomaly of Netflix throwing money around where it doesn't have to relate to profits is what allows him to go in there and go, yeah, I'm going to poke the audience in the eye for three hours and basically do an old man look back at his life's work only for like it's Frank Shean looking back at his life's work of being in the mafia and it's scorsezy look at looking back at his life's work of chronicling the mafia. and really what i think that movie is about is gorsezi who grew up around gangsters in little Italy, but who is a fucking nerd with asthma who had to stay home is he looks through the mirror darkly at at at sheran and all of his protagonistts, all of his criminal uh bad his criminal antiheroes and he and he says like and he points out like their end is this uh this misery, it is this and of total alienation from everyone uh, and I don't have to worry about that, I'm not suffering that because I get to do art, because I get to tell stories about them, instead of do that stuff, I mean, I'm benefiting from the same capitalist machinery that they're all part of, buse organized crime is a is like a load-bearing member of the capitalist political economy. it cannot not exist, in fact, it must exist, and it must be directed towards capitalism's ends, which is very easy, because organized crime accumulates people who care about money, and therefore they could be socially organized along a class interest that is basically orthogal to you know uh the legal classes, and they'll do what you need to do, they'll do the stuff that can't be done in a democracy, and that's a big part. of the Irishman is is the relationship with the teamsters and the way that they worked the labor movement and maybe killed Kennedy. We are live, why are people saying we're not live? I'm talking, why do you think uh, all right, I will, let me go to twitter.com and tweet, I'm gonna do it right now, you're gonna hear, here I'm live, dummies, are you, even if you're gas like. I don't care, all right, so that's the kind of gold you occasionally get from this model, but what you're mostly going to get is people who are at the end of their creative uh rope, probably who aren't getting challenged anymore, uh, and now are just being indulged to their extremity, and they may going to be able to you, it'll be interesting, it'll be better than you know the great. man or whatever the fuck, but it will, it will not be a movie, which is what they used to make, the the the uh, the challenge won't be there, so the effort won't rise to it, and that's why streaming is just a new and lower form of art, the problem with talking that way is that people get defensive because they think, they think that if you say that... a form of art is like less uh meaningful than another one like you know in terms of conveying the human spirit all that stuff you want all the abstraction all the abstract pleasures of art that are like the the apolonian elements of art that are that are rested right on top of our dionysian desire for uh just distraction and indulgence which make up that's why we look at art also because it feels good but it doesn't just feel good it also connects those feelings, the good feelings to something that is eternally good, i'd say that's what art is, but doesn't mean that you're bad for consuming it, it's what's on offer, and we all need something, even if it's grul. the problem comes when we decide that no, the grul is all there is, and that actually uh, all that other stuff is worse, inferior, at least the same thing, and i don't need to engage with it at all, there is fucking tweet from like a a British newspaper or something that said, uh, people say that there's a less literate culture, but that doesn't uh agnowledge all the words that people consume in the television and films they watch, like yes, because that's not fucking literacy, that's not reading for Christ sake. so that's why you can be, that's why I try to indulge the middle position as I do in everything where I am, I just sort of try to suspend myself eternally, dialectically between the adorno critique of popular mass culture, which I think is is a correct sketch of like social function, and the fact that that's what I got, you know, I'm not on a mountaintop, I'm in a house, I have time to spend, what do I want to spend it on? but I acknowledge it as that what I don't do and what I I try not to do anyway is try to infuse that consumption with uh political meaning that is the most important thing because I I earnestly believe that the the cultural turn uh is really just response to the the death of politics, it's not the result of people making a choice to betray the revolution, sell out, it is that the grounds that they lived on, that fought on had shifted underneath them, and they had to adjust themselves to this new reality, in which the the halls of power were closed, real political action had been foreclosed, the CIA had gotten up to its business, assassinating everybody it needed to, but that's really just uh up operation, the real war is fought in the late 40s and early 50s, and and but by the time you know uh we come up uh we've seen the ground laid by you know this machinery of death that just this clipped our democracy such that it existed into this form, but you know that's because the the uh the social engines that built class power from the ground up were sabotaged, we're broken up, we're blown up. dropped into the machine, boom, you've lost your fucking uh, you've lost one of your uh, fan belts, there you go. red scared, boom, there go, there go all the carburators or whatever the fuck, i don't anything about cars, but it takes a while for the machine to you, it's still coasting on its own momentum, and and we were there for a while, but it was since the 70s we've known, even if we can't see it, say it that there's no more horizon for political action, and so where else to go with culture, hoping that maybe we can push the culture collectively through a willing it in a direction that might get people to act differently and to reclaim. the political uh uh destinies, that's of course what we're all going to want to think, buse what's the alternative, what's the real alternative, smashing yourself to a pieces against the state, defining yourself against the order until it destroys you, but we saw the people tried to do that, and that ended up just being its own form of indulgence as much as people going uh corporate or whatever the fuck or making the cultural turn and deciding to go to the academy and tell everybody about you the semiotics of elf in order to get them to become marxists. my head is tic-tack shaped. i think that's true. it's pretty much a square. they called they called scando's square heads for anybody who's seen deadwood. because they have this headshade, minion, maybe, maybe a minion also, but we're at this point now where people can no longer hope that that their consumption of politics uh can stand in for action because action is becoming imperative. people feel a sense that oh, there's this thing coming towards me, there's this train coming towards me, what am i going to do, where am i going to go? and there's no guy, because we've we burned the map, and so there's a huge uh, incentive built into our social rituals, the ones that technology has bent us around to seek to escape the question of... of of action uh by creating pseudo action and and consuming art is part of that and again uh I'd say that basically 100% of the of what passes for a political uh conflict online like what those what people are talking about like at the... very sharp and like not even democrats or republicans, but like you know the the the left and the right as as groups is people shouting into a mirror and that they are both beholden to their paralysis, both addicted to their uh participation in the orgon cycle of online politics, uh, both made sick by that, because they feel the anxiety deepen and can't do anything about it, they feel the misery deepen, alienation deep and can't do anything about it and load their own inaction, but they cannot confront it, so they have to recognize it in a mirror, in a mirrored twisted image where their participation in it is laundered basically, like you get to look, if you're a uh a lib, you get to look at your if you're a socialist, you get to look at at the at the right, the groipers as these death obsessed, uh psychopaths basically who want to see the world burn, well by their actions, by our by your actions and their actions are basically the same, your actual things you do in your life, the stuff you do, the stuff they do, it's the same thing, and if that's bringing about the end of the world, well then you're doing it too, you just are thinking differently about it, and it's the thinking differently about... it that makes them bad and you good, but that is superfluous, you have to pick a side for the thing to work, you have to get on one side or the other of the seasaw for the thing to go, or like you're you're the two hands on the on the uh, on the the pump car, the old cartoons, pump car going on the railroad track, you need two hands for that, some of them can use one, but a lot of them have too. because like that is that is the thing that all of this is meant to uh overlook is: We feel this anxiety, which manifests as loathing of theself, but also loathing of others, loathing of who we feel as responsible for the moment, who we feel as responsible for while we're here, now remember, we feel some responsibility of ourselves, and I would argue that for the most part that is a neurosis, if you're not amongst the actual like architecture of power, if you don't have capital that you are actively managing, uh, I think you can't even be said to really be responsible in anything other in any way that is real, like your day-to-day actions are the same as in their intent and interaction with others as most other people in the in the dispossessed class are, but we feel responsible because we're putative political subjects in a putative democracy, and it's our commitment to that belief of uh, that belief in ourselves as that. that makes us feel this degree of guilt, and it's the guilt that has to be turned into hatred of others and punishment, someone has to be responsible, now if we could look at it as a system and eliminate, the judgment, the need to judge ourselves or others for their participation, then we can notice, oh the people responsible for this, i don't, i've never seen one of them in my life, probably you have. the people i interact with on a day-to-day basis, regardless of their political opinions are in the same boat as me. and then you can say, okay, well what do we have to do to survive this coming, this thing that's coming towards us, this train on these tracks that we're locked to, what do we do? and we have two choices, we can get on try to get on the pump, pump train, or we can find someone to put in front of us. now here's the difference between those two actions, the pump thing, that's not a political choice in the way that we think of it, it's not voting for somebody, it is actually doing something on a daily basis cumulatively with other people towards. goal pumping it out there, because that is all you can do to engage with a capitalism that has been fully abstracted to servers, to algorithms that are inaccessible spatially and conceptually to the average person that you might think you represent, somebody says do I do any rituals, this is basically my ritual right here, the biggest one I do anyway. but if the question is it, what are we what am i going to do to get there to avoid this from happening? if instead it's, well it's not going to not happen, it has to happen because i'm addicted to the things that it gives me and i can't move because i'm scared to be in a situation that's less pleasurable in the moment than the one i'm in now because i can only imagine things getting worse, but there still is politics, well then i can vote for somebody to get put in front of me so that i can watch them. get hit by the fucking train before it hits me so that i can get some joy out of living, some joy out of being a political subject participating in seeing somebody who is fault this is to take the fucking the cowcutcher in the face before we get it and i would say that those that that desire is what stitches together the... higher corpus of the American political body. now you can say on the left, that's not fair, what about people who want socialism? yes, socialism would be uh, would be a way out of that, but socialism cannot be built politically right now, what can be built politically right now is machines of retribution, at the national level, i'm saying at the local level, local politics could be. to a defiant relationship to all that is, there's plenty of people like that. now there are a lot more people who have been beaten into aquiescence or terrified into it, but there are a bunch of people who are just sick of this shit, but they can only be meaningfully politically aligned by the right through the mechanisms of spectacular politics that were all fixed within, because on the right you have. vastly larger group of people who are willing to conceive of conflict, why? because they would not be going against the state, they imagined that they would be claiming the mandate of the state, police, high-ranking military officers, suburban dipshits who wear camo and and like hang out with cops and police officers, they have. private firearms, now within the this bipartisan structure, plenty of people who vote democrat are like, fuck this system, i would go down and i would throw down against it, many of them have, they vote for democrats out of the compulsion that they're better than republicans, but they are not organized, they do not have that kind of uh relationship to the security institutions of America, and so they have no, they conceive of a rupture as confronting state power, and that's terrifying, and that means and and it's exacerbated by the fact that the higher you are within this structure, that's in you're not voting for democrats, you are a democrat, or you demographically are among the group of democrats who actually determine who gets to run for democratic offices, you have absolutely no desire to see. because you're still sitting in your fucking suburban home, that is a calf, because your side won the culture war of the 60s, which was a necessary victory, because capitalism has to be in a global, global capitalism must be cosmopolitan in culture, it is necessary, and that's why a bunch of dipshits think that defending national reactionary social formations is some path to conflict with capital, but that is organized around this land-based uh capital that is essentially a residue of feudal social order and is grounded in a way that your participation as just a voter or rooter for the right isn't and which means that in a rupture it will reassert itself using the technology of capitalism, it will not advance. away from, it will not advance from capitalism to uh uh socialism, it will regress to the sort of uh of techno, technologically uh infused feudal land-based regime of domination, because that is what's getting the backup of organized resistance on the rights to capitalism, it is not exploitation through class, it is alienation from culture. because no matter what this actual class position of someone who is uh in a sense of personal identity consider themselves a rightest, it is a belief in the hierarchy, the vestigial hierarchy of pre-capitalist social formations. and we are left with the task to infuse the relatively few decisions we get to make in a day with meaning and and remove them from the realm of the automatic. and that sucks because you can't talk about it, you can only really honestly, you can only be poetic about it, and and this is not a poetic age, this is a place where if you want people to hear you, if you want people to hear your voice, it has to be uh, it has to speak in like a a very concrete prose, because we've robbed, i mean it sounds kind, it sounds you know uh cheesy to say, but it is true, we've robbed as like as we've robbed the public square of spirituality, we rob it of poetry, because we robbed of that if the the recognition that there is something unspeakable, unobservable, describable about experience, we labor under these cultural delusion that that is not the case, and we are being driven insane, in fact by that, by by the inability to to communicate poetically, we can only communicate literally, which that's for machines, that's for robots, which capitalism is trying to turn us into. so you got to put poetry into your life, that sounds super fruity, i know i'm sorry, but it is true, that's all i got over here, and the way that i feel better about that is like, yeah, that sucks, that's not very good, but i'm one shmuck, i'm not, this is not my job, this is not my job, this is not any, getting to aha, is not any of our specific jobs, our specific job is to be there for it. to be there for history as it occurs and stealing ourselves and and directing our minds towards that goal and then playing a part that will be determined by uh time and space and chance in a way that cannot be anticipated and would be foolish to try to, because if you anticipate it, you are basically locking yourself into a uh doomed relationship with it, because guess what, however, whatever you tell yourself it uh how it's going to go, that's what your se think about what's going to happen in my life until I really get understand what's going to happen in the next five years globally nationally nope that that thing you're going to build out of that that's that ship in a bottle and it's a ship that is your design to go your design to go on to with the other uh the other opium addicts. and i am at the end of the day fucking optimist because like what what is the what is the what is the moral political what is what is the animating morality of socialism, it is the creation of uh heaven on earth, not heaven as as as community. union with God, which we cannot have, but heaven as we imagine it in a folk sense, as a place where people live through time, through perception, through sensation, but without alienation, and of course, like it is a cornerstone of liberal understanding of the world, the one that they've been trying to drill under our heads for 150 years, is that that's impossible and that any politics that has that at its base? uh cannot be successful, it's going to kill everybody, if you think you're, but the reality is is that anything that is not driven by that, anything that is in fact driven by the end sage capitalist concept of man as essentially at war with itself, can only be directing itself subconsciously towards annihilation. like congratulations, by avoiding utopian thinking, you have guaranteed a dystopian actual ending. and now what that look like given our understanding of what humans are capable of? look back in history and see what humans acting in concert can do in terms of extending their consciousness to each other beyond one another using technology. we've seen enough examples. just in the actual history we've lived, we don't even have to fucking imagine an extrapolate into the future like the si-fi folks have been doing for the last couple hundred years uh you can just look at what we've done every element for a global Sweden basically you know a place where maybe people do kill themselves buse there's nothing buse it's kind of boring but there's like a basic uh uh dignity to life and therefore resultant relatively low level of social pathology. uh, just that is absolutely achievable given what we develop technology, technologically as a species over the last 100 years from... the not just uh tech, not just high-tech shit, like the computer, like obviously we've conquered any computational problem with computing, but also just basic shit like the green revolution, allowing for like un never before understood or conceived possible population densities in the world, transportation, energy, ween we've solved this shit. but instead those pieces are being put together to make a fucking weapon of destruction, it's going to kill everything, because it was all built in the context of capitalist accumulation, and of course they capitalist want to look at all the advancement and say that was capitalism, it's like no, all the doom, now of course you might say global sweden, that sounds boring and dickless and shitty, and uh, yeah, if you're like socially reactionary or you're even just like anti-woke, which you fair enough at this point, it's just if you're still caring about this stuff, at some point you're going to pick a side and just out of bordom, so I don't blame anybody who picks any side, if they're you know, I don't care, uh, but of course global Sweden would not look like Sweden, global Sweden would not be capitalist because Sweden is capitalist at the end of the day, it's just one part of a capitalist machine that is able to negotiate a spatially and geographically. fixed relationship with capitalism that was only sustainable there, those conditions globally is not some uh sad, some fucking igmar burman movie with a bunch of people looking longingly into the distance, it's people working towards goals, all of them that are socially and individually aligned, that's not the machinery of Orwell that he feared of, and that's because he saw the Soviet Union in the context of scarcity, it would be people moving towards their best use of their own will in accordance with their position, and I think if you don't have that as a political horizon, then your politics are worthless, because the only alternative to global Sweden is Geoh, this point has been made for a very long time, Rosa Luxembourg most famously put it in social. or barbarism, it's it's banal and it's true. so you have to ask yourself, what is, what, how do you get there? and i think that for a lot of people who even on the right, would say, those are my politics, global sweeten, white people everywhere having a good time, again, it's a... because guess what, it will not be in creating socialism, it can't create socialism, it will not dethrone capitalism within itself, it will try to maintain this surplus, this this volk surplus diverted to the center by star holy shit, what i'm saying social, when i say global sweden, i mean global swedish standard of living, not talking about anything other than that, we're talking about given the conditions that we have in this world, given the technology we have now, how could people live like as in access to things like healthcare and fixed relationship to capitalism that of course is dissolving all those specially fixed relationships that got built over the course of the truce between labor and capital in the post war era, they're all unraveling and they're creating these barronial revolts by local reactionaries. because there's no social, there's no uh working class to resist anymore, they've been defeated, and I'm saying, a a world with global Swedish standard of living, does not have the social uh problems of so of uh of of of Sweden, it doesn't have no problems, it has personal problems, everybody is, it's it's it who said, it's uh, socialism is converted. hysterical misery into everyday unhappiness, because we can all live with everyday unhappiness, we cannot live with hysterical misery, we drive ourselves to destruction to escape it. and the peronial revolt is a goddamn absolute dead end, watching Peter Teil say like, oh, we're gonna need to do uh, we're gonna need to do techno theocracy here to save uh capitalism and save, save freedom, like guess what, that's exactly the goal that the fucking globo homo agenda that you're trying to defeat is trying to do, is in power the algorithm formally. It's been in power for a while now, honestly the same year that uh trans that terminator 2 was released is the year that uh the algorithm became self-aware 1991 at fall the Soviet Union, but of course it's hidden behind these inefficient screens of uh democratic accountability that are undermining its ability to function, because we have to all act like politics still exist, even though they don't, and so now we've got this gridlock. where no crisis, and the crisis are just going to keep piling up on top of each other, look at fucking uh, good lord, corona still running wild and now we got monkey pock showing up, of course, for the right, seeing these crisis pile up and then become unaddressable, this can only be explained by secret cabals and great resets, it has to be intentional. because things like the United States and capitalism and the constitution are good and have good uh uh uh blueprint for stable and secure and upward advancing government, not a unstable uh uh truce that is constantly being undermined by changing economic conditions and so they ah it's a great reset low look the're they're they're mak we're going to when global warming starts like swamping huge parts of the world, they'll be like, yes, they made this happen, they're trying to get rid, oh they're cutting the power, oh they're cutting our food supply, it's like, no, the system can no longer sustain itself because if it's piling internal contradictions that political paralysis have rendered unaddressable, and the only sense, but the only sense that the... reactionary revolt against capitalism can make of that is as plans as cabals, and any working class energy that joins the right will be organized around those principles because they don't have the balles, they don't have the the the the cultural capital and real capital that would be based on to present an alternative theory. So yeah, like we're going to just fall from the bottom into a pit, which we can't speak of, and that pit is not, here's the here's the most important thing, that pit is not the end of the world, that pit is not the real inferno, that pit is just beyond the pale of settlement, beyond the legible world that we who are in this hall of mirrors have arranged to make sense of our our world, it's just out of the picture, it's out of contention, it's out of the political subjectivity that we are all related to one another within, and then those falling are going to be moving to one of two specially fixed capital accumulations that are going to have the same robot security guards and uh and psychotically armed police and and uh physically removed uh elite but different political rituals around that and different stigmatized groups to be ritually punished for the misery everyone feels but can only be directed in its blame out because uh we've lost the the voice, we've lost the voice of the human race, which is supposed to be the uh, the self-conscious working class speaking together, now it's just a cacophany of people who consider themselves first and foremost as consumers, not their fault, not their choice, this is why i have to reject at the end of the day conspiracy fixation, because it is a search even from the left. for someone to blame and punish, and that is surrendering our political horizon and saying, we're not going to imagine anything better anytime in the future, we're going to imagine uh, we're going to imagine payback for what's going to happen anyway, uh, and I think any of that energy that goes out in the world is going to get used by capital, it's not going to be uh, buse violence, I'm not talking violence, violence on behalf of a a nation and growing connecting, working class movement, that's that's the purest sort of sacrifice, I mean my god, you're talking John Brown stuff. there, but you know, that the time for that is obviously not now, because where where is the working class structures to direct it, they don't exist, they will be made by the future, we'll all have to uh, be there for it, but anything that wants to find someone to blame now is just going to be playing into the hands of a capital that will take that energy in any direction. wants uh, but anyway, to get back to why I'm an optimist, so that thing I described right, the utopian horizon where you have people working technologically together towards full consciousness, full species consciousness, well by, I mean, just logically, the same way that Christians say that you, God has to exist buse we can imagine him. that has to have happened somewhere because we can imagine it, because when we're talking about human history and not human as like a species, but human as consciousness, as conscious life, which humanity is part of, but only one strand of a much denser connection of of uh of states and manners of consciousness. uh then that that that history is also un unbound by time, the number of chances, the number of conditions that emerge are basically limitless, which means that the number of outcomes is essentially unbound, and that's one of those outcomes and since that's going to happen somewhere someday, then any act we make towards its goal will make us feel good. see, i'm basically doing a humanist version of Roko's basillas car. because those guys are of course the people who have extinguished any notion of the sacred, any notion of the un the un uh the unquantifiable truth and have resurrected that in without even knowing it in the form of this this algorithm that they worship because they imagine that it is uh outside of them, but really it's just a container for their their selfishness, and they're like, oh yeah, that machine got built. and if you're not helping to get built it's going to punish you, well what, look at there, the goal, what's making you act, fear of punishment, you're just resurrecting the the the angry god of protestantism that drove capitalism to destroy the world in the first place, and what a shock, this is it at its end stage, when you've got to the point where smart people really can't take religion seriously, if they want to be in another room with a bunch of other smart people, people who understand computers and such, buse we're all, we all know that sky very stuff is nonsense, but future uh uh omnimpedent time traveling AI, well that's certainly something we can consider, you've just made God again, dude, but you've made it in uh, you've made it not as a repository of of connectedness, and the love that that is that uh, that connectedness is represented by in our experience, but rather our reptilian. loathing of one another, our fear, so we can only act because the machine is compelling us to act, not because we want to, want in the deepest centered sense, not of wanting to uh, satisfy our neuroses and our pathological relationship to the things around us in a way that distracts us from our deepest feelings, but one that makes a resonance throughout our entire being, and we all know... we can't, once again, this is a thing where we know what this is, but we cannot really describe it to each other, because it is an individual experience, but we all know that feeling, the reason everyone is going crazy is because we live in a society where we are basically forbidden from doing things like that most of the time, and i know i did say we live in a society, but it's true we really do, the joker was on to something there, and we live in one where to advance the self, which... so we have to just find things that make us feel that way and then build around them lives that can accommodate them and they can connect them to other people who can feel the same thing buse people getting together the same towards acting together are beyond compulsion, this is one of the big, but but the thing that gets us to that point, it has to be a combination of our values, our abstract values, but also our necessity, like what we have to do to survive, there has to be a moment when we can bring those together, and the real problems of the contemporary left and what prevents it from being a left in a meaningful sense is that by definition it is largely volunteer and a voluntary left is one that will skew disproportionately towards the people who understand their experience of capitalism as one of guilt and and accountability and a desire to uh to have that expongeed and that means that their engagement with politics will. towards in large enough samples to be indulgent, not that there won't be a desire to do good things there and people want to do good things there, but they will always be swimming against that current, and this is why the labor movement is always and only and forever, the last best hope of humanity, because it is made up of people who are in it to win it personally, for their families for the people that they love in the near term, say like now like the bolschevic party of course was made up, the reason that the party will forever be the model is because of one and one. because it was actually both of these things, you had a bunch of uh uh fancy boy emotes largely, not not all of them, some of them came from the working class like Bucaren, but uh, or no, I'm sorry, Bucarren was just like Lennon, he was a school master's kid, there were a couple of uh working class kids, uh, but they mostly stay, they were people who came out of the labor movement, the trade union movement in Russia, then you have a bunch of immigrates who get to sit around in coffee shops and think about theory all the time, and so when they come together in 1917, It is as this machine that clicks into place, people who are on the ground and did the organizing from the bottom up out of necessity because they weren't getting any fucking food to eat, and the people who were doing it to expregate uh uh guilt and to enact like a a life of uh of a will to power that all modern subjects do have to some degree or another. and they went to war together and they overthrew this art, but in the process of winning the war, the working class half of it was essentially destroyed, because they were the guys who fought the war, but they mostly got a lot of them got shot, and and uh, that politically active, connected, conscious working class was replaced in the cities by a new generation of displaced peasants whose relationship to the bolchevic party in the soviet state became morekin to their relationship between... the upjumped and and uprooted peasants who uh made up the post vita British Russian working class ruling yeah Russian working class and the old zius regime and all you have is this new bureaucracy on top which ended up carrying out not the agenda of like the Russian people and not the agenda really of the working class. is in like their best, their felt interests, but rather modernization of Russia, the creation of a competitive capital formation, a technologically advanced state capable of going toe with the other technologically advanced capitalist states, but not using capitalism, because their faith basically prevent them from making it capitalism, and because at the at the tail end of the stick. once you get out of Europe, out of western Europe and the United States and you get to larger, older social formations, and you have advanced capitalism engaging with them, it's not, they don't get to build so they they don't get to build capitalism the way those countries did, they have it imposed on them the way it's imposed on colonial subjects, that means stagnation at the bottom, that means domination by foreign powers, which nobody, whether they are a putative marxist who wants to you know save Russia and build Russia so that it can advance the cause of the global working class, or just a great Russian nationalist who doesn't really have a vocab. of class consciousness, you can all align on that goal, and that is the goal that stalin allied around, and he did the same thing that the up-jumped active bourgeois did in every country, and of course it's very fitting, that stalin himself was, sorry, was neither a worker nor one of the bourgeois exiles, he was a fucking lumpin proletarian criminal. he was a guy whose dad was an alcoholic shoemaker, got his ass beat every day, lived on the street, it was hung out at a monastery or a seminary to get to some uh you know free free meals and then became a street criminal in his teens and also a poet, meaning that he is not subject to the same. is a way of advancing global, the war against global capitalism, to to be the the real profit, to embody that prophetic role, but he doesn't also, he also doesn't want to kill a million peasants to do it, he doesn't want to build a machinery of exploitation, the lives that the capitalists did, he understands that that's not what socialism is supposed to do, communists are supposed to build out of the wreckage created by that process, they're not supposed at with the machinery and the capital that had been built up, they're not supposed to uh exercise it themselves, but he still wants to do it, so he's left paralyzed and basically begs somebody to take power from him. Tratski again and again is given an opportunity to advance himself in a way that would have allowed him to meaningfully confront Stalin for power, and at every point he steps back, he says, no, that would be wrong, because he doesn't really want power, because he does, he shrinks away from the responsibility of doing what deep down he knows needs to be done, then you've got buukaren and the right? who i think had the best diagnosis of the situation, i think were the buukarinites and that they said, oh social, social revolution is not coming worldwide, which means we're not getting rescued by the Germans, but also uh, if we try to build a industrial state that can compete with the west, meaningfully, it will be at the cost of going to war with our own peasantry. which that's not in the cap the socialism playbook and he was right about that, but what buukaren imagined instead was a system where essentially per essentially wanted to do pararastrika uh 70 years earlier, he wanted to do uh, he wanted to extend Nep and and build build a uh market relationship with the peasantry to uh use capitalism to get them to. advance uh their agricultural production the way that they did in the west, and the problem there is that that might be theoretically possible, but a cold clear look at the conditions of the soviet union face in that period will tell you that the west would not have uh stood for that, that the introduction of capitalism would have meant the breaking up and these and probably the end of Russia, now maybe you get enough drinks in he might be okay with that, because what's Russia, it's the working class, like I understand this, something we have to work with because it's a historical reality, but it's not real in a way that I should emotionally connect myself to, guys like Stalin actually thought Russia was the whole thing, so they'. so so Stalin is able to embody this knowledge that none of the other factions can accept, and then he neutralizes them all in time, he he uses, he he allies with bukaren. to neutralize Zonov and Camenev and then turns right around and uh neutralizes and carries out what what uh Khamenev and and Znovjev and Trosky for a while were all demanding, but here's the thing, none of them would have been able to go through with it, and if they can't go through with it, what happens to the Soviet Union? and that's because Stalin had a did not have a a utopian horizon to his politics at the end of the day. there's a there are uh notes in Stalin's uh archive where he's got like volumes of angles and like angles is talking about... you know the real like how uh how socialism would extinguish you know uh hierarchies and it would extinguish monetary economy and and stuff like that and he would just write hahaha next to it he believed the it's war man against man is wolf to man. All right, so that's this week uh, I am going to do, I've decided I'm going to do Richard Lachman RIP's book, uh, first class uh, passengers on a sinking ship for the next book, but not maybe for a couple weeks, because I said, I might get Sam Granden on the show to talk about making of global capitalism, but uh, might do another uh Q&A app maybe later this week before we get to there, so Stay tuned, keep it sleezy, bye-bye.
