 Who's pumped? Who's pumped? I'm pumped, I think everyone. should be really pumped, we're all super pumped right now, feeling pumped, jazz about basically everything going on, feeling good about the whole arrangement, no problems for me, uh, I mean, how could I feel bad in a world where Donald Trump was finally asked about Queenon and gave the single best answer he possibly. possibly could have because the question was amazingly put in the perfect way to make him find out with q and on is and then immediately embrace it, it was like it was like she was a CIA like mk ultra operative offering a trigger phrase to him like would you like to play cards? i got to play it, i'll play the clip. it's to me, it really is, i mean like. i don't want to pat myself on the old baccarooni, but uh, as soon as Q and on emerged after the election, I said, this is the future of the GoP, this is going to be the entire thing, this will eat the party, and that's what it's doing, because it is, because if if if believing in party politics, if if caring about who wins an election is this new realm of psychic warfare where people sublimate all of the horrors and anxieties and alienations of their life into a fantasy whereby someone in charge is going to fix it somehow. that they get to have some sort of investment in at the level of being able to participate by watching them and rooting for them on the TV and then voting for them, then it's going to have to become a richer and deeper and more psychotic fantasy to make up for the continuing degrading traditions of life, conditions of life in America, and so one of the big questions was about that that progress like turning it in, turning us into a q nation for the right was, what about, what's trump? got to say about this buse people show up with the q signs and but you know he's not he's not on forchan he doesn't know what's going on and so this person this amazing reporter asks her asks him totally expecting that the way she frames this question it's going to lead to him denouncing queuenon because she leads by saying hey these guys are uh they think that there's psychotic pedophile cannibals out there running the world and they think you're stopping them that's what do you say thinking that he would hear that and that he would think oh no That's irresponsible, that's not, that's not what this country is about, like Jeb Bush would or something, oh no, I have to, like learning the Buckley lesson from the 50s, you got to denounce the cranks, but only all Trump heard was, uh, these people think that the people you hate are demonic cannibals and that you're beating them, my god, you've literally just imprinted onto his playdo like brain a comic strip that he could now have in there, so this is what he said, this is the question and this was his response, this was actually she asked him first and he's like, all i know about him is that they like me a lot, and yeah, that is all heard, and that's all he cares about, cuwan likes him, so why is he going to say anything bad about them, and then she tries to like push through, be like, this is why you're sup'. to not like them even though they like you, listen to this, she leads with you are saving the world from pedophiles and cannibals and she thinks he's going to hear pedophiles and cannibals and think that's not realistic, that that has to be denounced, we can't allow that in our in our public sphere, but he hears, you're saving the world from cannibles and penophiles. is that a bad thing? for the problems, radical left, do they eat kids? i don't know, it's a crazy, it's a radical left philosophy, it wants to destroy the country. He's already in his head, he's already created an architecture whereby the people against him, Joe Biden and the antifa black lives matter terrorists want to dismantle western civilization, of course he has to think that because they want him to not be president anymore, and in his brain he is America obviously uh, like he has made that cyclic transference, and then the Q people have made the similar cyclic transference, yes he is America, so that's why they are all aligned on the same, that's they're totally polarized along the same magnet. line like the lay line, they're all they're all iron filings pointing in the same direction and that is that he is the personification of Americans so that they want to beat him then they want to destroy America and everything that that means so of course I mean pedophiles and cannibals why wouldn't sure why not why wouldn't baby cannibals they're bad they're terrible they want to destroy America why wouldn't they want to eat babies and what's so funny about this is that now like this is in Trump's. of course he's going to forget about it in tomorrow, he's going to forget about it soon, but if he keeps hearing it, if he keeps getting exposed to Q, that express, the specific framing she gives it, he is going to turn that into part of his litney like they're destroying the cities, what they did to Portland, what they did in Chicago, it's monstrous, it's worse than Iraq, it's worse than Afghanistan, and many people are saying that they're doing even worse things, they're doing things that you wouldn't believe, things with children, okay, in basements, a pinks for restaurants. his brain is already just things he kind of vaguely believes that he's projected on other people that are all just like reififications of his ego and like another piece of uh of of narrative architecture to build on the idea that he is defeating excuse me that he is defeating evil sure and i mean i'm just imagining a future like where we actually do get that i don't think this is going to happen but it could happen we get the disputed election and somehow Trump does actually engineer is able to fingle to get there some sort of coup. i think that by the time that like resolved itself with the the constitution in in shreds and military government finally uh, you know, enforced and democrats in jail, that he will incorporate the Q story into his justification, which means that the Q people through sheer belief, sheer will of faith will have made their fantasy reality, they would have reifified their collective. delusion, they are the great alchimists of our age, they are doing the Magnum Opus, they are transforming the world through sheer will, they sat on computers and said trust the plan for four years, and it has led now potentially to, if things break the white way, the president carrying out the coo that they've been dreaming for with the same justification, so when it happens, it doesn't matter that there was no actual child pedophilia or that none of the actual things they believed at any point were true. the broad strokes of the bad guys on the TV gone and even the reason for it will be what they claimed and even if that doesn't happen and I would say it's highly more likely that it won't and and uh like Trump either wins the reelection and and the norms maintain themselves even if it's shady or Biden wins and Trump leaves so the the republican party's cuification will continue because if you are if you cannot reconcile America as experience. and thought of, you have to create a fantasy, and that is what these people are going to continue to need to do, and so it's only going to get more broke, I mean, it's going to have to get really baroke to explain how Trump was president for four years and nothing changed, uh, but they'll do it, I, I mean, their commitment to the bit is is unprecedented, and they it's they are the blob, they have this, they are amorphist, they they shift, there is no center to it, it's pure just imaginative fantasy, it's it's a pure realm of of of of... pleasure and play that doesn't interact and intersect with the human world in any way, but the world is still going on, and if it bends towards their reality, which I mean put it a few. more few years down the line, we're few farther down the line and climate and economic collapse, and finally some force does sunder the last connective tissues to our formal democracy, it'll probably be the right, which means it'll probably be people who've been coming up on this stuff, this stuff that now is fringe will be their belief, the same way that the gold water rights took over the republican party, and q will be official orthodoxy when they finally do evaku, whatever some crackpot fucking air force general, some evangelical nut. case so went to Colorado Springs and got his brain filled with bleach, comes out and and the the uh declares that the pedophile network has been extinguished, they will have made reality, not through any action, like all leftists are are stuck here just trying to figure out one some way to interfere with the the horrible bloody machinery of of history right now and change the trajectory of our of our civilization, and they just get to ride the avalanche to the manifestation. of their deepest psychic dreams, and that's because they fully, they have totally submitted themselves to the spectacle, they've submitted their minds to it, they have removed any interior barriers of intellect or thought or logic to to provide friction for any any event that occurs, which means all events are assimilatable, that is the mindset that you're supposed to develop in capitalism, that is the full post-modern, fully uh relative. relativistic, unmored self, the capitalism creates and what hilariously conservatives always complain is being created by cultural marxism, now it's being carried by capitalism, and q will become the new like expression of America's tradition of transformative materialist christianity, and they will be wizards, they will be warlocks, they will be alchists, and the left can't do that because you actually have to do something to change the trajectory. "the q people are just watching and writing and have have accommodated themselves to anything that happens, so that means anything that happens can fit into their cosmology, and that means that they are shaping reality to themselves, like they have, they have shaped themselves to reality in such a way that they are now in their minds, kings of creation, they are, they are kings of infinite space within the within the uh, inside the nutshell, because they have. surrendered any attempt to reconcile fantasy in reality, they've drop, it's like two things, it's like they're trying to plug the thing together or we all are, and they just dropped the reality thing, they just dropped the the square-shaped reality uh plug and held on to the round tube of fantasy, so they get to now be warlocks, they get to be fantasy uh the kings of the realm, uh, meanwile on the left, just everyone's just in horror and trying to tease together some sort of belief system that could possibly push against it, absent any ability to coordinate action between people in a meaningful way, which is what you need to break the spell of history, instead of just succumming to it, and the funny thing is is that there's going to be a lot more on violence in the near future, very much so, like apparently there was a lady just drove her car to a bunch of people she thought were pedopile. I mean it's going to activate a lot of latent mental illness in people and and it's going to be uh function, it's going to the vectors are going to be aligned around a political point of view, uh, but that will not change the essential larping, pseudo political nature of uh of Quanon, because even those acts, even if some guy tries to kill Nancy Pelosi, which I think will probably happen or like drive a car full of explosives into a uh into a uh into the Netflix headquarters or whatever. hell they want to do, anybody, everyone who does that is going to be operating from the same fantasy logic and operating from the same heroic fantastic self-perception of the that is unconnected to reality, like their unique, their specific violence is going to be just one more pointless piece of violence in a county a wash in it, it's not going to be cumulative the way that political action is cumulative because it's coordinated, it will just be a bunch of of individual school shooter types. basically who have been specifically radicalized along a political axis because of the nature of the of the society we find ourselves in where politics is a is a is a center of of fantasy, a center of a spectacle of fantasy that that gets wrap wrapped up in people's imagine imagine um imagine conception of themselves, imagine conception of their own uh autonomy uh and their their libitnal life, their their their pleasures, their dream. their dream lusts, their desires, and of course that's part of politics everywhere, that's inevitable, but the cute thing is the total sublimation of. of everything else but that or the total obliteration, leaving only the remnant of just this uh, this fan, this illusion of magical agency, and so that means that even if they go around shooting people, which I think they will, especially if Trump loses, it will still not add up to political action, it will still not add up to a fascist movement, but if the army ends up overthoring the government in 20 years, you know when we're in some sort of in the third year of like a fucking uh of of a of a crisis of around food production uh and massive internal uh population shifts due to natural disasters and uh resource deprivation caused by global warming they could very well do it under the flag of Q which means that their fantasy was able to transsubstantiate into reality because they lost any individuality into... the spectacle itself, am i right guy? hear that guy? i've never heard of, i've never heard a bird like that, are we sure it's not a rat? oh, it's a cat. i've never heard a cat like that either. fuck, are they? is it horny? are they horny? It's a squirrel all right, now you guys are all giving me the business, you guys love giving me the business, it's farther away now, whatever it is, hunter bidon is talking tonight at the DNC, I'm very excited, it's not going to be as fun as it's as you're imagining it because... nothing can be anymore if you're expecting anything, that's the thing, like if you're expecting, if you have a thing, if you're expecting your fantasy to and reality to have some sort of symmetry, you will be disappointed, that's why q people are the masters of the moment and human warlocks, because they have given up reality, so they can never be disappointed, everything is always as good as it could be, they got to bring hunter in cuz he's like he's the one left, i think he's had a daughter, but I don't think she's just like, she's she doesn't have a public profile, and they and then they're going very much on his biography and specifically all the bad stuff that's happened in his life, they really are pitching joe biden as come on, come on, look what, he's all his family's dead, let him be president, and so to have one of the few remaining kids left who's alive to be like, yeah, my dad suffered a lot, I remember being in the hospital with him and all that, that's a huge part of what they think is going to appeal to some like mildly trump averse uh suburban voter. and of course it'll remind us more and more, it'll it'll be there to remind us of that he is running for morner and chief and that this entire thing is just a giant wake for our country and that the job of Joe Biden is to just help us down the path, not not to fight, don't fight, it goes so much easier if you don't fight. Commander in grief, indeed, that's what somebody should give a fucking uh, somebody don't give that to this to like time magazine, don't make that the cover, commander and grief, I haven't read, someone's just read libra, I haven't read it in a long time, I need to read reread it, I remember liking it, but uh, the thing that sticks with me are the poor. his mom, that is wife, it's a very specific sort of person, and it actually goes a long way towards sort of explaining uh Learve oswald as a character, because he's mostly opaque, so it's a good way to do it. Oswald, that was his mom's name, yeah, see somebody says, I don't even think that you could say q people are cucked anymore, because if you don't have, if you don't have a uh, loads, if you don't have a connection to reality, if you're not comparing your... ever be cucked, what materially? yeah, but if you don't feel it that way, if you don't feel your loss, okay, maybe these guys, their lives are bad and maybe they get worse, well, would voting have changed it, was voting going to change it for any of us, who's winning in the situation right now when we see this country collapsing and all of its functions failing and and and like the the copper wiring and pipes getting stripped by our elite are planning to abandon us to our fate is as like all civil institutions dissolve into nothing and the... control system is totally incapable of doing putting any check on this process, wouldn't you rather be a queue person who thinks it's all going deporting the plan? if every one's life is going to get worse no matter what, materially, and there's nothing that will actually change that. if you're already on the in the free flow of like an avalanche and you're you know you're going to hit the little town at the end of the mountain, might as well think that there's a reason you're you're there and that it's all going to be good, right? It's the same argument for faith, you know, it's the same argument for religious faith, like wouldn't life be better if you believe that there was a heaven, wouldn't you be less stressed, wouldn't you be less angst riddled if you believed it, and it's like yeah, from a from a uh, the problem is in both those things is that from a uh, from the angle of uh, like utilitarian, just you, pleasure versus pain, headenism, yeah, that would be the smart. thing that's the rational move is to believe, but then if you know if you recognize it as a rational move, you can never really believe it. that's why you have to, in my opinion, the way to defeat that context is is to break the idea that you're going to change anything, that things can change, that necessarily things are going to change, to break from from an expectation that the political process can be interfeined with on your behalf and find. withinq there will be a breaking point as we're already seeing the guy who uh who went on the fucking uh hover dam with a with a sign saying release the report because he thought that's what was going to get Trump to to arrest all the pedows ahead of time there was a woman who just drove into people like people's conditions are going to get worse and worse and the fantasy is going to become harder and harder to maintain but it's not going to be universal it's going to happen to outliers first and then it's going to be like popcorn c one after the other, but for a while there and as an initial coping mechanism, it has a lot to recommend it as does any kind of regime of surrender, but eventually the dopamine runs out one way or the other, and you have to reckon with the the sterility of the world you live, the life you've created and the horror, the mounting horror, the realization that oblivion is coming. someone says what if we could get squibs back but only in movies directed by really scott uh when was the last movie that he even made with a gun in it? is it going to be like some guy doing shooting a fucking stupid CGI alien with squibs? how are you gonna even do that? because he does CGI for all those aliens. American Gangster, another bad movie. Yeah, I don't see what I'm getting out of the deal. I'm getting one movie. year maybe that's got squibbs, big deal, unless he's directing every movie, and that would be terrible, because then all the other qualities of film would get leached out of it, so yeah, terrible deal. someone said if you did a uh if you did ghostbusters if we did a shapo version of ghostbusters who would be who? i think i would be, i think i'm am I ray? i think i'm ray. will's egon and then felix is peter? does that makes sense? stop is the marshmallow uh, i'm very interested in seeing joe's speech tonight, i'm sure i there's no it's live right, have they confirmed that or not cuuse i got to assume that it is not fucking live uh, that's just why would they take that risk? but anyway, if it isn't it's going to be edited and it'll be interesting to see how they hide the edits, how they hide the number of times that they have to start over, because he clearly is at a point where he cannot really get across ideas in any kind of coherent fashion, it's very much, it's like a nematod, you don't know where it's going to go, yeah they should the the uh when i i did this the other day, but the same reference, but i think it'd be even more perfect here, when Henry when uh 100 comes on on stage they shouldn't have him walk out or anything, they should start empty frame and then he just pops up and then just starts talking, maybe play jump into the fire, yeah they're going to say it was great though and that'll of course be very funny to see the uh the contrast there, i don't know how anything one thinks that this zoom convention bullshit has any. meaning, i mean i would not want to, you never want to give up uh that much free real estate on television to like pitch to people, but i got to think that like the whole uh, convention week concept is another permanent casualty of COVID, buse i would be surprised if biden gains really anything out of this uh out of this debate bump out of this especially since the republican was just next week. they're not even really going to be able to get decent polling to indicate how much it mattered at all and it'll end up not mattering at all, i mean you can argue it never does, but at least it's wasting less money than usual, which makes you wonder how the hell are they going to do the bribery they used to do, they used to be able to bribe uh the shit out of the parties by paying un un un uh unstintingly giving money to in uh to convention funds, and now what the hell are they going to do? but I really hope next week's Republican is blood and thunder and just pure, pure id because after this week, this fucking funeral, got to have something a little more zesty, I don't know if Kennedy is going to win, I have no idea. seen mark merk um, i've seen marky up in some polls, i've seen others that were basically tied, no idea, i wouldn't be surprised either way, i would certainly be, if Kennedy wins, it's going to be very funny, it's it's going to be proof that that now that we've jettison the idea that politics can actually aid your life in any way, the idea that voting carries with it consequences in the world beyond how it make you it makes you feel about yourself, if we're giving getting rid of that idea, which is is what they're trying to do, and you've drained out, you've squeezed everything out of the electoral appeal of the democrats, which Marky is trying to do, I mean Marky's trying to re reinject stakes into politics, I mean the reason apparently that Nancy Pelosi jumped in publicly to uh endorse Kennedy this late, it's like the fucking it's two weeks from election day, uh, it's because of that ad where Marky goes, with all due respect, I think it's time you start asking. your country can do for you, which of course that's a hell of a note to to ring at this moment when everyone feels abandoned, but the problem is that raises expectations that democrats, and it's not that they don't want to do them, i think people don't get this. people think this is a choice, people think that they could be good, but they're not, at this point they are considering the structural relationships within that define the democratic party and the incentive structures within that, they cannot do anything else, they cannot give anything, so they cannot create a lot, that's why they hate bernie more than anything, it's but bernie r expectations, they hate that uh, and marky is saying, hey, how about green new deal, how about the country provide for you in a time of? and that cannot be what uh democrats run on, because that will alienate their supporters when that doesn't materialize as it cannot, and so if you ring that out, if you cut that out of the danish, if you pull that out of the burrito of of democratic electoral appeal, you have two things left, and joe Kennedy, the third embodies both of them, you've got two appeals, one to old people, one to young people, for the old young people people, your appeal is intersectional, I hear you, we're gonna, uh, there is no poc mentioned in uh green new deal, we're going to, we're going to the uh uh, police brutality is whack and and we hear you, it's just it's pure emotive connectivity, the way that republicans have with Trump, like I, I suffer in this country to racism, misoggyny, uh, xenophobia, and my my feeling, my pain is felt, like Bill Clinton famously said, my pain is felt. and that's all it is, the original I feel your pain, the pitch is, I feel your pain and so I'm going to do something about it, now it's just I feel your pain, and that's better than someone in office who says, actually your pain is funny to me, and I think it's uh good that you're in pain, that's alienating, having having people in power saying, I understand that this sucks, it's it's the same logic that has them being very nice to you when you call in the fucking cable because the goddamn internet's out, your call is very important to us, we understand, we understand that this is frustrating, but that's all they can. is is just string along and wind you up along that emotional axis and that's the pitch to democrats or to younger democrats, to older democrats who don't care about any of that garbage, uh, the appeal is to nostalgia, and in this case the Kennedy name, buse those older democrats, they remember JFK, literally as in they were alive when he was there, and if they don't, if they weren't alive, they remember the context of him and they remember what he represented, the imprint he left on... culture when they were children that still existed. I mean, Ted Kennedy ran for president in 1980, even after Chapaquic, and he won a ton of primaries against the sitting president and was given a 40-minute standing ovation at the Democratic National Convention. That name meant something until relatively recently, not for fucking millennials and zoomers, they don't know any of this shit, but for older people, it defined their relationship to politics and so for the old people you get, oh, you get the... the Kennedis, they're going to come and fix everything, the Kennedis are going to come in and write what was wrong, they're going to bring back Camelot, JFK is like the acluded fucking body for these people, he was taken from us before he could complete the great work and then he would return, and what do you know q people think that too, only they think it's his son, everyone wants to be redeemed in a fucking uh, in a in a that everyone wants to be redeemed in apocalyptic uh... confrontation with our political enemies, which is the only, that's the only psychology of politics that can fit the amount of emotional investment people who are political put into it, considering compared to how much little control they have, vote, vote every two years, that's it, imagine that, think about that, think about how much you're supposed to as a liberal or as a conservative, think about how much you're supposed to care about politics, right? it's your responsibility, like liberals think. this way, left us think this way too, uh, I think any politically minded, like self-consciously ideological person thinks that way, politics matters, that's if it didn't matter, you wouldn't pay attention to it, and so it it it contributes to my life, and the thing is that's a recognition of reality, and broadly stated politics does, but then there's the specific reality of politics filtered through our our culture, and we have this fake puppet show politics, but you still are supposed to care. about it deeply, because this is the destiny of your life, the life of your family, your children, your children's children, america, all these abstract concepts and concrete ones that have deep emotional connections and power to you, including your own self-fucking interest, your own ability to thrive, these things are all wired into a ocean of politics and of the political, the political battle reflecting on your life, as in the outcomes of political battles are going to be felt in your life, that's a lot of dramatic emotional you got to argue between the sects on what, what you should be doing. for democrats and republicans really the only thing you got to do is vote at least once every four years, go into a room one day a year, take a pen and press a thing and then leave, maybe take an hour, if it takes like you got to wait in line and even if you got to wait nine hours if you're in a you know in a in a black inner city precinct where they love to get rid of the of the voting machines uh it's still one day, and then during the course of that day, the actual act is pressing a button or ticking a box, maybe you do it every four years, maybe if you're really into it, you do it on like primaries and stuff, but still you're only doing it maybe six times a year, most if you're a real sicco, how the hell are you supposed to fit that amount of emotional power, that emotional that amount of a dramatic psychic architecture of of of your destiny, like determining your destiny. in that act, it's impossible, and so you have to put invest more and more of yourself into the daily, essentially pointless grind of news, because it's the only place to put all of this fucking energy, this oregon that you've accumulated around this question of politics and your fate related to politics and your your your fantasies of your best life and your fears of your worst, your your desires and your hopes, all that stuff in twined on this political uh, along this political act. is that you have barely any control over, so you have to turn every day's meaningless philips of events into massively important things, which means that it's essentially you are waterboarding your own brain with the news, and of course that's why people post, that's why they go on the instagram and put all the stuff, that's why they yell with their unkles on those Thanksgiving table, it's cuuse it gives them something to do that feels like it's meaningful, even though it's not, it's nothing compared to this, and this is barely anything, you're so far removed from agency, even at the be even at the sharpest point, that it turns you into a neurotic mess, how could it do anything else? which is why the q solution is so seductive, you just give up resistance, you just absorb into the flow, you become the flow, but then eventually you're also still a person and there's going to come a point where those things can no longer be reconciled, you can put it off for a long time, but eventually the mental architecture, the ment the mental gymnastics become too uh, too exorbitant in the face of too much material stress, then you snap, you pop off like a little popcorn curl, so yeah uh who care is the response, someone said, hashtag hoore, so if you want to watch this stuff and and enjoy it for its own you know uh comedic possibilities and dark ironic resonances, go for it, but do not, do not invest emotions into it, because there's no point, buse, you have no control over the process, it's all fantasy that you have any control at all, and of course because it's a fantasy, because our because it's the central fantasy that... on all the time, like the democrats tell you, we can do nothing for you, all you can, you, it's up to you, you have to vote for us, you have to vote for us, and of course we can win, but that doesn't mean anything's going to change and anything's going to happen, because guess what, it'll once we get in, there's not enough of us, because not enough of you voted, that's always going to be the answer, that's always going to be the answer, It's it's it's the way that uh all con artists and cult leaders are able to maintain control of their sales pitch and uh their congregations is when something doesn't happen it's not because they were wrong it's because the flock or the or or the town didn't pay him enough money uh or or pray hard enough and so that's how that's what it is to do because like you can tell them and you can tell liberals all day Obama got in 60 majority, how the hell does we get as little as we got out of that administration? they will say, what are you supposed to do about joeberman and max bochis? it's like, well, they're democrats. i mean, does this this thing mean anything? and they'll say, well, no, they live in states where you have to be conservative because of the electorant, it's like, but isn't this like a majority position? yeah, but not enough of our people vote in those states buse they're too busy being pokémon or whatever. that will always be. the answers that you did not, you didn't clap uh hard enough for tinker bell to come back to life, that will always be, and and that's why nothing can ever change, because there can be no pressure exert at that point, there can be no pressure. "if you if you withhold your vote and they lose, they blame you and they're out of power anyway, you withhold your vote and they win, they ignore you because you didn't vote, you give them your vote and they lose, they blame you anyway, you give them their vote and they win, uh, they take it for granted, you have no leverage within it at any point, because there's no coordination, it's just people operating off of their individual response to the fucking pachinko machine of stimuli called modern politics." like the only way you beat it is by organizing people outside of a party. structure to then apply pressure as a group either on a party structure or if it's if it's weak enough to try to replace it, that's the only games in town, it has and it starts with organized numbers, and since that's it, not what we have, we have a left flank of a democratic coalition, all of whom act independently of one another as individuals, and as such there can be no point of leverage by them upon the party. they cannot mathematically do anything about it. well, DSA faces the same problem that all these organizations that spring out of the self-conscious cultural left have, which is that they are segregated among that college educated chunk of them of the under 40. generation and while it is true that like even though only 27% of people adults in America have a four-year degree, it's more like half of millennials and younger uh, because or a half of millennials because you know uh, those were the kids that the kids got sent to college sent to college, you know uh, so it's a lot more, but that's still only half of a sub-cohort of the general population, you need like actual independent working class uh uh uh organizing to occur and somebody was responding to the thing I was saying about the other day about um about how like there is this elite distinction when you're talking about the difference you're talking about the the online left and and like the self-conscious organized left like DSA or whatever you're talking about like the broader population of young people many of and specifically the ones who didn't go to college and how there's no transmission between there, people said, well that's that's nialistic, you're saying that you know you can't know anyone else outside of your class area, i'm saying no, is an individual, you of course can, of course people know people and have rich relationships with people across those kind of uh cultural lines and know and they know how they interact with this stuff, but what i'm saying is that you cannot, there is no transmission at a level of culture between these two groups, it's all individualized, there's no actual transmission, they're independent conversation. or rather the the left college conversation is happening by itself, and even if people who are having that conversation also know people who don't have college degrees and talk to them about politics and maybe they even organize them or some or maybe they're even able to like change their mind about something, maybe they got them to vote, maybe they got their disinterested cousin to vote for Bernie in the primary, that's great, but it doesn't constitute an actual conveyor belt for like uh ideological polarization and radicalization because has no mass character, which culture by definition has to have, i feel like king kong swatting at byplanes with these mosquitos, i don't pose thorming a new party, i don't know what the hell, i mean the thing is there's no i don't oppose anything because we're at such a base level that any any act. suggestion of a thing, i mean its validity will come down to whether it can, it it has a plausible way of achieving significant uh buy in, significant public investment, i mean how do if you i i definitely see the absolute need for a new party given the current situation, but what about this new party in its conception would differ from all the other attempts to third party things that? failed miserably, what would be cuuse you can't just do the same thing cuz we know what the conditions of America do to third parties, if they have any kind of meaningful potency, they are, they are drained of it by uh being uh eventually consumed and uh having their platform appropriated and and water down but appropriated by one of the two parties uh or they or they stick around as crank uh spoilers who don't do anything like the greens so yeah i mean i gets in i'll i honestly think that that that the that a new party some sort of of emergent party structure is inevitable really, whether it's effective is a second question, but some movement for another party under like a crover cleeveland style hunger chancellorship for fucking uh for biden under uh the covid depression, which is apparently what he's planning to do, they can lie all they want, but they're pretty clear that they're saying, oh cubrird's bear, we care about deficits now, once again, oh turns out deficits matter when republicans are out of power, we don't just, we don't just do what the republicans do, which is understand that this is just a fiction that we use as a way to justify, cuts the things we don't like, we actually believe it, like i i said on the show today, democrats are are especially all empowered ones certainly uh, they're caccooned in like this pervert prison of of uh of uh superego where they get off on on repressing things, like the the the party is essentially self-selec'. on that Jimmy Carter Marter thing, Jimmy Carter Marter thing, Jimmy Carter Marter thing where they hold on to principles that the other side won't and that that means that there other corruptions and their other pettiness and their other just grubby political uh shinanigans are justified because they that is the difference between them and democrats and of course that's the the level that's the line they want to draw because it's a line that doesn't... actually uh impact their ability to maintain their position of power and influence within the party structure and then their ability to make a fuck ton of money once they're outside of it. Jimmy Carter Marder party Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter Jimmy. will i support the jde pawn when it arrives? uh, i won't be too, i'm sure I will not be happy when they put me up against the wall and shoot me, maybe i will have reached a level of of uh of of enlightenment at that point where i can welcome death, not there yet, certainly, but i certainly won't blame them even if i'm terrified, but i don't think it's going to happen, yeah. the whole the whole mark, the whole third world is thing is is surrendering agency in the face of impodence, it's like the the joint proletariate of the third world of the oppressed nations of the third world is is basically uh queue, they're going to come and save us and maybe not us personally, maybe we will be destroyed, but us as a as a as a species, they will redeem the species. if they put me on a running man type game show then i'm really done for, i don't think i'd do very well, i mean i think we know enough about like the dynamics of nationalism and and national and tribal identity that like if if if there's nothing to there's i don't have see a lot of lot to suggest that there's ever going to be a point where even as conditions get worse people in the worst most in the most uh like exploited and ecologically devastated parts of the country are of of the world are going to collectively decide that they're going to go fight America, they're probably going to fight the person across the hill, the because that's what we do, in the absence of class consciousness, that's what we do, and even in class consciousness, that's a hell of a reach, getting everybody to put down their local, you know uh parochial beefs to go after America. No, everyone, it's all a lot of this stuff is people just not. just wanting having to cope with the awareness that there's very little they can do about anything, even though things seem so dire and so emergent. I mean, that is like one of those psychological asymmetries of of of modern life that really does have an unspoken psychic strain over time, is that for most of human history, you didn't really think, you didn't have to ever think for a minute about like the future of the species, you didn't have to think about uh you know the the sort of existential question of like of of your children's children or something like that, i mean you have you are either struggling to survive in here and now, which many people still are doing and who do don't really worry about climate change because they've got things happening right in front of them to worry about uh they've either been like fighting for sustance or if they're outside of that and they have lesure time they've been they've been worrying about like the their their close kin network so or they would conceive of them, but now one of the the the creation of like a global social order and in a global communications network allowing us to know things happening all over the world, we have the awareness almost that feels akin to omnificience or omniscence, we feel almost a kinn to like a god, an embodied human in our our ability to know what's happening all over the world if we want to, but we have zero, not just not even we have zero of the corresponding power of a god. how the hell are you supposed to occupy that psychic space without going insane? Trump might win, someone says the worry Trump will win. Trump might win. It all comes down to this: in any, if if if if the normal electorate is like, there's three balls of electors, right? there's hardcore republicans, there's hardcore democrats. and then there's the third ball of people who kind of move around, they're not moderates, that's insane, they have an incre an amazing array of views, mostly totally incoherent and contradictory, some of them are essentially uh communists and don't even know it, uh, some of them are a lot of them are fascists and don't know it, some of them are fascists and they do know it, but one way or another they are the the thing that is important to know about them is that they have not assimilated uh the the party as an identity the way that republican and democrats have, and the thing about that is that once you've assimilated the party as an identity, then material conditions don't really impact your vote, because you will find a way in your head to blame whoever you don't like for it, so that means that you have a thing like a president presiding over a fucking giant catastrophic pandemic outbreak where our country faired worse than every other country on earth, which very much suggests that there was a lot of stuff we could have done to do some have different results, because they had different results. what the fuck is going on? i have not had a helicopter hanging around that fucking long in a long time, freaking me out. um, i'm getting, i'm getting the jumping the fire in my head again. uh, so there, so normally you think, oh, there's a viral pandemic that the the president made worse, there's an economic recession that he's not managing, this guy. to get out of here, but for republicans that never comes into the equation, oh it's the chinese and the fake news media and the deep state or whatever, and if it was flipped over, if a democrat was presiding over this scenario, you'd have the same group of people on the democratic side making it not his fault, and it's always the votes are decided if those things are mostly even, which they've turned into, they they've ground into each other and they're mostly even, they're basically the same, it that that uh electorate is basically older what middle. class people of all races, older, older middle class people, democrats, republicans, like as they get older, they they they grab onto a party and it it gives them solidity and like a place of understanding of the world, and for everybody else, it kind of bounced around, i don't know, and those are the people who when something like a recession caused by a pandemic outbreak happen, see who's president and go, yeah, no, get rid of this guy, the people who after 2008 said, Yeah, no, get rid of republicans, this is terrible, but what's been happening, when Obama really said in emotion, I mean it was always progressing, but it's been going much, super accelerated Obama, is the sort of falling away of people who aren't operating under a party identity when they vote, people who don't filter all news through what party they belong to, and so therefore i can see something like what's happening with the entire earth and go, Trump might not be good. and the question is is like has that group of people, has that third ball of voters worn away so much with some people going to pick a party because it gives them more psychological uh stability to have a party to make sense of this world than to accept that neither party cares about them or like has a consistent approach to the problems of the world that can help them or realize well none of this matters and stop voting entirely and if it just settles around those two groups of people and there aren't enough of the third ball and those two groups of people are distributed in such a way that uh they can that republicans that Trump can win Ohio uh Trump can win Michigan Minnesota. Wisconsin that they can win. I mean, I would say that if I could bet on it, and I probably can somewhere, but I'm not going to bother, but this is free money. If you want free money bet on, whatever the odds are don't matter, bet on Biden winning the popular vote, he will win the popular vote, by a significant margin, I think more than Hillary. Uh, but it will, that's irrelevant, and it will be amazing having a president if we do get a president uh, elected and reelected without ever winning the popular vote. Uh, pretty wild, wild stuff, wild weird stuff. no way and no one, it really is a coin flip in those three states, because everywhere else it doesn't really matter, and if Biden loses then uh, if Biden loses, we get the recession and the and the and the depression and the COVID crisis and the the winter of disconent under republican uh, and I mean I don't know, I honestly don't think. I don't know if it matters who wins or loses, I don't, I don't, I don't know if which one happens is going to, which I don't know if either one is going to have a different effect on the baseline response to the crisis, which will be people getting pissed off obviously and alienated, but they're not going to be operating in concert, they're not going to be operating in any kind of organized setting that's going to be able to channel that in any meaningful uh uh any... meaningful non-compliance with the state that could change the balance of power and maybe allow for some fucking humanity to sip into this thing, so I don't know, I don't know if either one's going to be better or worse, you can make an argument for either, but the thing is you're just guessing, like the argument for Biden, and it's it's a decent one is that like is it Trump, because he's so polarizing, and because he is so uniquely uh horrifying the liberals, basically impossible to have any kind of deeper argument about you know structural political and economic questions because of just the deaf the deafining noise of him and the way that he allows and and the way that he masks his you know buse he's he's he is as much a minion as the neoliberal order as any of these people he serves the powers to be just as much as anybody else uh and his policies his broad policies are to the benefit of our ruling elite and that has not change, but his personal style is such that no one who considers themselves culturally right can do anything but be in aw of him and fantasize that he is some sort of tribute of the people, and no one and among liberals anyway and big portion of the left can focus on anything other than his just gastly awfulness uh, and that means that you can't talk about any kind of systemic anything because it all gets personalized in his his being, and the hope is the hope would be that under Biden would lay bear these contradictions because the the defending the airhorn of Trump would be turned off and people could hear things. i have no idea. i don't know, it's all about how people react to that, and that is something that has yet to be seen. all right, going to take one more question that i'm not. someone said someone said let me see if i can find it ah someone said at the end of the day do you still feel that the Americans are freedom loving people and to that i say yes. Yes, yes, that'll be the last, I mean even when we are all chained to one another and a human cenipede of uh of like soilent production and expulsion and and nutrient uh protein chains, we will still think we're free, and we'll love it folks, we love it, we love the freedom, don't we folks, we love it, we love to be pretty, I love it, bye-bye.
