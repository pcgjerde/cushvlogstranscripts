 what the fuck man, is it doing it? it's finally doing it, by the way, i saw someone uh in the chat. that i was on a roll so i forgot to mention at the time but it just recurred to me uh i saw somebody was saying that like the quality of these streams is very poor audio visually and that that's uh Chris's fault uh i would like to say definitively and for all of time the chris has nothing to do with this fucking production this is a one man show when i'm out here and i hope you will notice that the audio and visual presentation are much much better when we're in the office with him. "this is my showweight, this is my deal here, so that means if it's if it looks like shit, that's part of my ramshackle approach to everything i'm doing here, i mean if i was serious about like trying to communicate an idea to people i would uh, sorry i just got text distract me, i'm on my damn phone here." Yeah, I, I, I, if I was speak serious about communicating ideas to people, I would write them down or something, I give them some thought instead of just say them off the top of my head, and I would also if I was going to, you know, talk to you, I'd like prepare it ahead of time and get a studio or something where it looks nice and it's presentable and like some degree of uh, you know thought has been put into it, I think like this whole deal. with the bad audio and the and me talking to my phone, I think it it is part of like honesty, honestly, it is a part of me presenting like an entire picture of what I'm doing out here so that you don't get the wrong idea, you know, although I do hope to write in the future, I have plans to do so, in early stages of doing planning for writing, something down, something a little more uh fully fleshed out. so and that will be something that I'll be very nervous to put out there because one of the benefits of doing this is that you you risk that you don't risk that like that fear of dissection that comes when you have something written down I know that that is in the past made me hesitant about writing uh but I feel now like I'm much more confident in what what I'm saying than I ever have been so as a result I feel I can put it down and will get mad, hopefully, people will be disagreeing, but and people say i'm an idiot and wrong, hopefully, if they don't, then i fucked up, but i will be confident that i at least got across what i was trying to, man, did anybody see Trump today, he just went on tv for five minutes to say, we're going to get a vaccine, folks, it's coming, the vaccine's coming, we're going to get it, and what we love it, we love the vaccine, it's the best, it's the greatest, everyone's going to be cured and our elderly, we love the elderly, we love our emily, they're going to get it first because we care about them and we want to give them the best of the golden years, the years the gold, they love them, so yeah, whatever, i don't know, april, he's maybe, we'll see, i mean nothing about the process until now has inspired any confidence in any. element of the entire uh response, and not just Trump specifically, but the entire western world, the entire Atlantic sphere, comprehensive fuck around, everybody, regardless of what institutions they had, what like remnant shreds of social democracy they had, almost all of them ate shit everything that everything that was that was built by us and the aftermath of World War II are like score is... shitting the fucking bed so i don't know why the hell i should expect anything different from the fucking uh single-minded profit-seeking idiots of the pharmaceutical industry yeah how are we going to distribute the vaccine what honestly they should give it to fucking mcdonald's like put it in the mcplant burgers i tweeted that the other day but it's not a joke like there's a fucking mcdonald's within a 20-minute drive of everything in this fucking country, have them give us the fucking vaccine, they have an ability to distribute all that fucking merchandise and happy meals and and smiling hamburger toys and fucking uh uh uh monopoly game pieces they could fucking send a goddamn vaccine out the speedy method as the mcdonald brothers coined it by the way uh that reminds me the master with michael keyton is a low key really good movie uh and uh his performance is really fun in it but what really is interesting and a reason to watch it is the way that it very clearly shows the the way the capitalism accelerates outside of any other considerations, like that nothing that like, i've seen very few movies that are better at exemplifying the marxist, the marx quote, from the manifesto that describes capitalisms destabilizing relationship to settle social orders, everything that is solid melts into air, and you watch that movie and that's what you get, because the mcdonald brothers did this, they had this like innovation that was a quantum leap in in uh efficiency in terms of food service is going to like you know that that changes the the the um entire equation of the profit uh the the potential profit in uh food service but they did that in their small town New England way you know like a couple of flinty yankey republicans coming up with an idea but they were doing that at a time when uh capitalism was is accelerating uh the post war era where where uh where where all that capital is looking for investment that we were we were building out a new infrastructure of like consumer demand and uh that their commitment to things like we're not we're only going to use real ice cream and you know well uh we're gonna uh you now we're going to keep up up a uh quality control over certain elements of this thing, we're going to maintain certain like non-market-based values, and they did well with their little thing, but as soon as Ray Crock showed up, a guy who because he was a failure basically, because he'd been chasing success his entire life had been ground into this like purely miserable instrument of regret and resentment. he came along and he just wanted to fill that hole as fast as he could buse he was an old guy when it happens he he'd been like he was he was in his 50s and he had never been a success even though he tried his goddamn ass off to be one and so he wanted to fill that hole the only way he could you know and of course this is just the uh this is a dramatic you know personalized version of like the greater material you know necessity that's going to make that happen one way. or another like McDonald's gets bought and gets turned into McDonald's no matter what, but the fact that it was Ray Crock who did it comes down to you know who Ray Crock was, but someone was going to do it, and then his wife gave thou that money to NPR, perfect. He was a funny dude though in other ways, uh, one thing they don't have in the movie cuz it stops, like uh, after he rests the name away from the McDonald Brothers, ale alert uh is that he owned the uh San Diego padres in the 70s and 80s and at one time he was watching a game in the owner's box and they were get getting their asses kick so bad that he went on the PA system in the stadium and apologized to the fans for how bad they were doing padres he lived in San Diego, he would also go to McDonald's like just on inspection tours and start sweeping up and yellow people for not doing enough uh, not doing enough cleaning, but uh, someone got mad. us today chapos for for again for not taking the coup seriously. I'm sorry, but if you saw, if you saw Trump today, I don't think you can seriously say anything about that anymore. He looked gassed, and he didn't say anything about this election that he had that he thinks was stolen from him and that he says he's fighting. And you know, I was very unfanted with what Como said, he said I was a covid cuko. It may be sad. It's a COVID, it's a covid cuko folks. and we love it, he said the next administration, oh right, i forgot, he's cook, he's done, he's finished, you know, like the the he only really had four years in him honestly, i think one way or the other, because he didn't like any moment of it, and he and what he had to do to enjoy any of it was so strenuous and and required such a escalation of tension that, you know, his heart couldn't take that much of it, Biden impression ah come on man ah yeah Felix is the guy that does bidon he has bidon uh down look look look look fat look god what a man what a king he did that shit and then he said that he said go vo for Trump to somebody, he said go vote to uh, he got go suck an egg to basically anybody you asked him to have any position was you know more that didn't have the like the 1996 dlc stamp of approval on it and he would say fuck off suck my doll threaten to punch some guy who uh talked to about guns in in Michigan just didn't matter just didn't matter and what that tells me more than anything is that you now there's this spectacle of politics happening and then there's the actual thing of people voting, and I think that, I mean, I've been saying, there's not, I don't think that there is anything like a one to one, like this is not in any way a reflection, this is a distortion so severe that it is genuinely uh, maddening in the sense that it takes your mind away from a consensus reality between people in a lived environment as opposed to within the individual frictionless silo of your cyber life. which is what allows you to imagine that, because you never come into contact with any real thing, you can just argue all day, and that's why you're there anyway, you can never have like a a presumption defeated by the internet, you can never have your your automatic response to something that is counterproductive, corrected, that's what real life is for. so this thing is just completely off the rails and so i'm not sure that any of the stuff that we ever thought mattered really did. i think we're talking about like tectonic relationships between like big demographic slabs of people. and the reason i say that the future of the republican party, if this continues like you know in its trajectory, like Trump boosted, this was happening since 2000, but it really got accelerated by Trump being the showing up and being the nomine and winning and and shaping the culture in response to Obama, like obama was like the thesis. basically of like what the party system would be in the 21st century now that we were reforming society's economy again because if we talk about the 1970s as the moment when the relationship between the working class and the democratic party suffered the uh the crash was the severance of fuck the democratic party from humanity like the full and complete abnegation of response posibility to citizenry, and I know that that's all, flummery and culture, but it's like stuff that the people in these positions actually believe exists. It was the 70s, it started in the 60s, but the the recorrection of the economy, the breaking of the back inflation didn't happen until the 70s, what are you talking about, that's that's just incorrect, I mean don't try to fucking correct me with incorrect information, I'm already out here far enough on a fucking win. people throwing bones under my feet, good lord, uh, it was Carter, man, Carter did it, like it was all, obviously it was a crushendo, and it it involved actions by every administration leading up to it, but the one who had the decision to make was parter, and the one who had the decision to make in a similar environment was Obama, and because there was no uh, working class to be at the table to just speak for the people at all, they did a further re bipartisan re uh af. of the economy and and a further removing from the political of any economic question, again just like they did in the 70s, the fucking bailout, the bipartisan bail, which republicans pretended to be against, which helped create the shadow t party, this like fake opposition to the bails, which had no extension into any real depths of the party leadership, or honestly it's voters if they understood the questions, beyond just as as shivel. and then they got turned into culture war, like the tea party warcry was Rick Santelli on CNBC saying that they didn't want to pay for losers to get bailed out of their fucking uh ins uh um bailed out losers from their fucking uh mortgages now there's a world where that happens no matter what right like where as a response to this like action by the government of letting people stay in their homes and and voiding their debt and like making making the haircut come from finance rather than the fucking citizenry uh then you would... had like this fake re fake uh populist response to it, this like jeffersonian, jacksonian cloaked uh horse shit, like that there is the reason they talked they called themselves the tea party, like this this is a violation of American liberty, and the thing is, yeah it is, because let American liberty exists to prevent this kind of thing from happening, it's like an ideological and political structure meant to harness like the citizenry in any understanding of the concept and prevent them from. getting rid of the thing around their fucking neck, and there are enough people who have like bought into the you, last 200 years of like phony populism that's at the heart of that Jeffersonian project, and so they would buy into it, and there you would have had a real meaningful conflict, and I guarantee you that this election, if that had happened would not be about antifa or any of that bullshit, we'd be talking about industrial policy, maybe, but of course like I said, this is a world where Obama doesn't do that, but that was not the world we lived in because the working class wasn't at the table. Obama was never going to do that, couldn't have happened, he was evil for doing it, but someone was going to do it because the forces arrayed could have no other outcome, but I'm saying if we lived in a world where that had a different outcome for some reason, otherwise we have the same and I know this why these are you know teedious because you have to do so many what ifs that you eventually the comparison doesn't hold, I'm just saying that uh that what we ended up getting instead was this fake populist uprising against the the death of American'. liberty, but then they didn't actually buil out anybody from their fucking mortgages. the thing that got the tea party going, bailing out losers didn't end up even happening. it got turned, it got evidenced immediately into a culture war, the thing that Romney talked about, the makers and the takers, because taxes became the only thing that the government could do about anything. What about the Kansian stimulus? I mean, it was the bare minimum necessary to to put a floor on the American economy, which had to happen, like a demand floor had to be imposed for the good of the market, and that was what they did, but on the stingiest possible terms, and that was because Obama bid low on purpose, because they thought, well fucking Olympia snow has this aversion to anything over a trillion dollars. There's no reason or rationality behind that, that is pure just pig-headed political idiocy. They could have been at four, and then what's she going to say, nothing over two, like it's just arbitrary relative to the bid, and the bid was low on purpose, and it was almost all found in the form of tax cuts and rebates. Now I don't think it's that this response that well the thing is with the senate the way it is, it's honestly hard to say, we really could end up with something as bad, as the uh 09 stimulus, buse that was because I think the the scale of the problem is in this case uh deeper, but and and but also the answer is easier, like you really could solve a lot of this just by helicopter dumping money on people, it could have a hugely positive effect, and we know that money is free at this point, like everybody knows it, and of course the republicans are going to talk about the deficit more now than they did under Trump, which was not never at all, because that's their ideological like you, puppet to distract. from the fact that what they really want to do at any moment is prevent spending from being directed downward. so like i said, i'm not predicting anything anymore, but it's not going to be great because the working, there's nobody at that table but lizards man, absolute demons, people who have shed every human skin, I've ever had and replaced it with the diamond hard scaly plate. I haven't stared at the chat for a while I don't think I got new glasses, I'm just I'm still. used to them i don't know they they i'm still not used to the looks so i kind of like see myself and i think well what oh thank you says but the thing is like you cannot overestimate how demonic this is going to be a friend of mine uh has been asked by the state of pennsylvania to give them back uh 12,000 dollars in unemployment that they say he fraugulently claimed uh when in fact he had literally like misfilled out a form that he then fixed because apparently there's a company that like 40 states paid millions of dollars to to carry out their emergency uh uh unemployment system because of course the state the state a mechanisms are intentionally uh deprived of funds so that they are ricky and impossible of ever. bring action so that gaining uh relief is difficult, you want to make as many hoops as possible for people to jump through so that you make them have to have skin in the game, all that disgusting like skinner like skinner mindset that pervades among the liberal uh bureaucratic policy set, and now the state because there's no there has been no second stimulus, there has not been a big federal relief of state, but because states can't borrow the way that the federal government can, so you're going to see massive, massive budget f because basically the complete skeletization of the whole state apparatus at a time of national pandemic emergency, so they're trying to claw money back, apparently they're doing just they're sending checks to millions of people, and a lot of it is on false false uh, false claims in the first place, and the horror of it is that I honestly think they don't even care if they have specious reasoning or not, they'... think a lot of people are going to get that freak out and then just give them back some money, and if they get any x- number of them to do that, well that's that's that much more money you can put on the ledger, and then they probably end up charging them more money than they're getting back to do the fucking uh job, monstrous, and it must be stated, this is a government with, that's a state with a democratic governor, this is this is just the way it is now, like pain for everybody, and then you get to choose whose pain you get to feel good about when you got in the voting booth and then watch politics as the sport that it is. you get to root for a team of people to inflict pain on another team of people, the pain is taken for granted, and the real horror is even the uh people getting it are going to get it either way, everyone's getting it, it's really just a matter of who you in the observation of their pain get to feel superior to, get to feel luckier than, that's it, that's politics, that's the politics at the end of history, and that's why I think the parties are going to end up being college and no college, not going there, but embracing the set of values, because the whole thing is it's symmetrical sadisms, like there is a sadism at the heart of like the the liberal project, I'm sorry, there is the same. at the heart, even if you can say it's for better reasons and it's more justified uh for for like the the the punitiveness of of liberalism as it's understood by the people who vote for political parties, who either accept or reject its idea, and so the future of politics is choosing who you want to see punished, who you want to feel good about being punished anyway? and the sc and like uh, it's quite, it's quite sober in to think about, because there's very little leeway for uh, for humanity there, like everyone's worst instincts are the only ones being fed, because the parties will basically become incapable of addressing class issues, and for anybody who is actually making this idiot track towards the republican party just so that they can feel good about an election. like the people who are like going, well the democrats are too woke, working class people are voting republican now, that's where working class aspirations can be found, no, what's happening is you are totally invested in the spectacle. of politics, it is sports for you, the pain of your enemy is your supper, but now thanks to your your in your mind defeat in the civil war within the democratic side, you now have to find a new place where you can feel good about somebody else's pain, and so you can go root for the republicans, and that means if they win and the democrats lose, you get to feel better, whereas if you're on the democrat side and you've been beaten for like internal you know for your sense of identification, like you can't even identify as a democrat anymore because or as a liberal or leftist, whatever fucking word you're using to cover this identity, you can't imagine you can't call yourself that anymore because the people, the other people who do have ruined it, so then you can't just watch the spectacle and not have an an an investment, because then it would be robbed of its of its ability to keep you enthrolled and you'd have to fucking do something else, and you don't want to do anything else, so you do, you switch teams, the switch teams, can't feed them join them, and then you get to feel good again, you get to watch democrats get owned and feel good about it, like you used to do it for republicans or internally, what like for a while you could do it with democrats, but after essentially you spent four years watching the Trump people have too much fun, and now you want some fun, if none of it matters, and that's true, then you might have. have some fun, and I would say, well, okay, but even better to not get fun there at all, because it's sick place to get fun, what are you doing, what the fuck are you doing, literally do anything else with your time, so if anybody is, yeah, so for me, the answer to all these seemingly. intractable question vlogers well down to if not log off decenter because it's a lot easier to see the forest for the trees. how many people who uh are uh love screenshotting naive leftists who stand Aoc and go, look at you idiots, look at you idiots falling for this. how many of them smuggly retweeted Marco Rubio saying the republican party is going to be the working class party? We have to change our message. Marco Rubio okay, yeah, you have to basically just dril a hole in your head and forget everything you learned about your process of being disillusioned by the Democratic party so that you can go on to get disillusion by the republican party. It's like the end of fucking dark tower, he gets at the end of the thing and he opens the door and he's back to where he started because he has to keep doing it. so you go through this process of coming into identification with the the democratic project or the left project, the liberal project, wherever you are on this spectrum, and then being driven over time to this process of disillusion with it as a vessel for your ambitions, which are material, but also identity-based, and then you get kicked out of the process and instead of recognizing, oh this was this was what happens when you do that to a political party in the United States of America. you go, this was the problem with this specific party within the United States of America, at which point you're back at the beginning chasing the man in black across the fucking desert, and you can't blame someone for this necessarily, you can only blame them in a broad sense, just more in pity than anything that they can't recognize the cycle there in and break out of it, so that's sad, but you can't blame them because within that, within the... to break out of it, they have not yet been disillusioned by the republican party, it could be a place where they could get fun and enjoyment and the sense of political identity and own the libs again, so let's find out. somebody asked about the ideological like motivation or structure of of like the whole college thing, like the whole suite of ideas you get, it's very not, it's not really about like specific shit, like culture critical theory, critical race theory or white privilege, any specific strain of academic jargon, that's just... like it's expression uh uh you know uh within like a social matrix like people talking about like these ideas float around the important ones float around and then they get expressed in like... subconcepts, which by the way mostly start in and around college uh issues, but it's more about a broad suite of of of of values, like liberal western values in the broad sense, but then like there's an intensity of it depending on like where you are within it, you know, like you've got the broad idea, like western democracy broadly understood, shared by everybody in all departments and every class you're going to take you're going to get. but then you've got over time, you know, and because of the cultural turn and everything, you've got now all these other uh places where people talk about other things and they have more specific takes and they take the logic of the liberalism that's broadly accrued throughout college experience and and lived and then they bring it further down into a a point of more specific uh reference to uh to like a theory, an issue, like they're doing academia, you wouldn't call it science, but it's science ask and they're doing it. and everything, and some places within that, like the humanities, you're going to develop like a more consistent sub- genre of the greater liberal uh, ideology, and then people will gravitate towards or against that, but they encounter it one way, broadly or or specifically depending on their specific academic career and who they encounter, and then they get come out the other end and they accept some percentage of that. the very base one being, even if you don't believe any of this shit about a liberal social order, you better if you want to make a fucking buck in your entire life, they know that much, and that is shared by basically everyone who goes, because they wouldn't have gone, especially at this point in time, really for any other reason at base, that doing this stuff, listening, believing these things will get you a job, and not just any job, a job that is in some way personally reward. which is going to choose where you get your first classes and which ones you start with and then what experiences you have in college and your personality and all those things and then shoot child the other end and you end up a political subject you either vote or you don't vote to prove that you think they're fony, and if you vote, you're probably going to vote for one of the two parties, more often than anything else, you're going to vote for one of the two parties and it's going to come down to what percentage of that suite of stuff you accepted or rejected, the degree to which as is always the case, people make fun of me for saying that all the time, but it's the only way to really talk about these kind of concepts, because understanding them as binaries makes it almost impossible to conceive in your head of what? how the structures work because they're they're three-dimensional, it's almost as though we are shaped by our material conditions, Michael Scott gift, thank you, and that because people who make culture tend to be people who went through the college process and specific. went through the humanities version of the college process, they will most likely make culture for from from that point of view, and because there's enough uh, like there's enough generational wealth left at the end of like the rainbow with you, the the last the last bit of equity from the boomers and and and some of gen x, but not that much, certainly no millennials, we're able to cling to... if not like an actual working class an actual like um like job the idea in their head that they could get one yes I'm doing this but I'm really this yes I'm doing this but maybe this yes this is my day job like this I have a greater aspiration and that greater aspiration is inculcated by this deal that college offers you and that you accept and that you have to pursue. because you can't just say sunk cost because the sunk cost is six figures and fucking debt, it's literally impossible to change direction at this point, and so that provides like the social motivation to maintain like these these values, these public profession profession of values and like to participate in this culture, but this is the last generation. is going to have that experience, that broad middle class experience of college, because of the combination of it becoming prohibitively expensive, that at some point people are going to stop going, already be started now with fucking corona, because the rewards are less and less uh, tangible, they're less and less even conceivable, and even if it doesn't, the experience of being disillusioned by college is going to become a lot more uh, completely disillusioned by college is going to become a hell a lot more prevalent than the one of this like let down by the college experience in its in its offer of stable. and a non totally alienating labor, but the prospect of said from some grind hustle, some personal commitment to you, a professional career path or the arts and media or social media, and that means that the electoral future of the Democratic party is very grim, when you combine the majority. and built-in structure of the republican system that we have, the constitutional order, which already rewards people who are going to be uh more likely either to just be rich enough to vote their fucking economic interests, which are not the people i'm talking about, they have an entirely different context, the ones wh make it are a whole different scheene of this, all like this is a process that happens at every level based on your relationship to actual means of production, so if you made it like make made it out of college and not was the difference between warren and Bernie in the primary. So if you made it, your calculus is completely different, but if you didn't, that college suite of uh, of like social quees, more, uh, media. propaganda you want to call it, whatever you want to call it, like whatever the ball of of culture that kind of keeps people uh having faith in any even symbolic worth in the act of voting for a democrat is going to shrink and it's influence on the levels of government is going to shrink now. how fast it's going to happen is up to a lot of things, one big one is how they actually do respond to this fucking pandemic, which I don't know, they could surprise me, I highly doubt it, but they could actually do a competent job or at least better, noticeably better than the republicans, could happen, not holding breath, so that changes the whole fucking thing, that could like re, that could just by ass backwards, like they accidentally like add a add a comma to the stimulus bill, like it literally just was a tipo and nobody noticed it, and then boom, they're able to to you know like uh juice the the consumer sector and and like take the boot of debt off of a bunch of people's neck and allow them to participate in the market again uh not be like fully extracted miserable little uh uh gig monkeys and biden's the new FDR by accident that would be perfect end to his career and then he dies with a full viper but no not going to probably happen the other is who comes after Trump the big thing is like Trump's specific non-college pitch is built into his celebrity, not into any of his ideology, none of his ideology, anybody who's and that's why the talk about hally and cotton and making it coherent, making it policy-based, giving ribs and and and armature to to Trumpism is putting the ass, it's it's the kind of mistake you make when you're in the bubble and you turn the fucking thing the wrong direction, looking through the wide end of the telescope there buddy. But who is in a position to replace that? Who can who can sparkle the way Trump did? I don't fucking know man, I don't know. dude rock 2024, now there's a campaign slogan, no, I would not trust any movement led by Joe Rogan, I do, I don't think he's a nazi or any. that bullshit, but just the mind's a little too open, i think you need a little more structure there, you need a few more first principles that you can depend on, when you're dealing with something that would be, as fragile as a celebrity. that movement, oh, I guess I'm talking about from the point of view of the Republicans, I don't think he would do that, because I don't think he's committed enough to the project, I don't, I think that politics to him, caring about politics risks getting owned, like I think a lot of the the a-political like Rogan types specifically, one of the reasons that they in their mind are say fuck politics is because why would you risk getting owned over something that doesn't matter, and it doesn't have the visceral appeal to something like a sporting uh fandom and so... you're gonna always stay a little bit away from it and you might endorse somebody in a primary or something, but you're not gonna fucking pick a team color because what if you lose? and the thing about Tucker Carlson is, he's got the celebrity, he's got the Zim, he's got the zazel, I think he could get the college educated portion of the Republican party, those people who went through the machine and decided to oppose it, and they're always there too, remember we're just talking about them being. brought about being having been having them added to by more uh working uh non-college people, but they're always there, they've always been there, and uh, they would love love that, but would it, would it have the same appeal to those people who, although they're moving towards the republicans, it's not like it's fixed in stone, a lot of it depends on who they're running against and what, what you know, the happen stance of you, who's in when the bad thing happened brands the democrat, like it's still, it's still there, like we don't know how, i just don't know if cucker has the zazel outside of that bubble to appeal in a general the way that trump did, don't know, don't know, still not convinced that he could run a economically populist enough uh campaign for it to really matter at all. and if that's the case, well then you're just talking a rerun of Trump, but with this fucking botied dipshit instead of the greatest famous guy who's ever famous. i just i think kharisma is going to be a much bigger factor there in like creating some coherent trump uh descendant, some some evolved trump form because like Trump is obviously he accelerated a process, but you know we don't know. yet if he was prefigurated or if he was then if the next step was going to have to come like up because none of these lines including the line that goes down goes straight down they're all punctuated by changes because the're interrupt all these processes are running against the the uh they're running on the correr road of uh of randomness right of the random distribution of events of of the butterfly effect and so it's it's it's never a smooth ride you know. And the big thing that makes me say that is just who is who else is like Trump in the culture. I say Jon Taffer, but Jonfer is not that famous. Basic cable, that's not a network show that was in the top 10 in the last generation of network television, which is now gone by the way, like that kind of people being on TV, the way Trump was on TV, that doesn't exist anymore. Trump was on TV. and then you got the fact that he was a businessman so he could fake a sort of pseudo experience of politics, it's like i mean people say the rock, but he is soy boy at heart, i mean we know which which side of the cultural divide he is on, he is a soy bait, he might have all the appearance of like a a a republican type guy and say he's a republican, but his he's got a soft core, he is humanities, no matter how much he wants to say his football team stem, he's he's a theater kid, he's a theater kid, you seen him on Saturday night live, motherfucker is a theater kid, so he is, I don't think he could run that campaign, now the real what if is if sworker could have run, that's a real whateff right there, because there you have... have like pure charisman starpower minus like Trump's specific cynical uh invocation of like crabbish uh um bigottry cuuse you know Trump at the end of the day is just a disgusting fat load of shit uh with a 7 billion dollars in debt to the Russian mafia and there he has to fill that hole somehow and you know that's how he got people build the wall I mean Sworker my god. You swirt slider. and he did, he did, Arnold did kill the apprentice, but that was after Trump left is the thing, that was too late, when I say Schwarznager, I mean like 08, maybe 12, once Trump shows up, and he gets that uh, he picks up the stick, the George Wallace stick, wraps it around his own like fame, fame and glamorous public image, ooh, That was a powerful force, that was like King Arthur pulling the sword out of the stone, but so obviously academic because Schwarznager could never run for president, thanks once again to our us constitution, it would be funny though if he just ran and won and got sworn in and they couldn't do anything about it. but because that is where the that's what the constitution is now, which I'm glad, but at the same time the fact that people still other than republicans who should at all times be invoking the constitution, because it is the the the document that most closely codifies their conception of you, political economy and and uh and the social order, like it is all there, it's all there, which is why it should have been destroyed in the civil war, should have been, it was like the fucking you know what it was, is the goddamn ring, it was the one ring, like for America to become uh, a coherent national identity, the constitution was necessary, because the 13 colonies where none of them were in a position to impose force on the other, so they all felt, but because but as but could potentially be subdued by them, combined against them, it was a mexican standoff or an American. standoff, I guess, the constitution structured the way it is for the specific purpose of preventing at base democratic overtaking of uh governmental structures and then on top of that uh any like faction within the greater United States can coming together to overthrow uh uh the ruling class, the boston merchants and southern land owners who made up the revolutionary generation of our founding f'. and the civil war proved that the pressure of you know northern uh northern wage relationship upon this like quasi feudal remdit was of course still uh capitalist, it was a key component of the global capitalist network, but there was a fundamental tension politically at its heart between wage relationships. and that could not be contained within the structure of the constitution because those type of people weren't supposed to be involved, they weren't even supposed to be here, you know, they weren't really like here, you know, they weren't really supposed to be here, like you know, they aren't real at all, like that's that's where that boy stons, and but the thing is is that the unit, the north was only able to defeat the south because of the power that had been cruwed over the last 80 years to the executive branch, to the federal government, uh, that was only allowed by the constitutional compromise with the states, it was only while everybody's guns were down that they were able to accrew without even knowing they were doing it, the capacity to defend uh the state itself against a fraction within it, and then they put it down, and then it's like, Okay, good, it's done, we don't need this thing anymore, federalism is dead, we just killed it, we just burned it, we've burned Atlanta to the ground, federalism is dead, we we we brought a state into the union, well uh, the representatives of a huge fraction of our country were not there, ratified constitutional amendments, opened half the fucking land in the Louisiana purchase. a settlement, free settlement, the civil war should have been the end of the US constitution, it had served its political purpose, it had defeated mordor, it had defeated saron rather, it had defeated the saron of slavery, now it was time to cast it into mount doom, and then you get on the precipice and who's that, who's that on the precipice, golem himself, uh, John, Andrew Johnson now that's of course glib as I've said a million times, I don't think that there's any reason to believe that Lincoln could have by himself having lived changed things enough. to redirect the flow of like racial solidarity and uh you know the direct the the the capital reformation of the south like away from uh plantation agriculture to the Yoman model that uh persisted in the north even though Lincoln Lincoln's entire political ideology was premised on the idea of turning America into a Yoman republic as the wigs conditioned it but uh we'll never know is the thing we'll never know one way or another. the fucking ring did not get into the fucking uh volcano and now it's sitting around just corroding everything and turning us all into slathering creaturess and so that's a like i want to talk another thing about American exceptionalism another big like obviously the number one element is free real estate but built on top of that first caused by the same material. reality shaping its politics, - our constitutional system, which had sort of a natural historical purpose really, as as a as a like a progressive instrument in the furthering of you, the consolidation of wage relationships into conflict with one another, then keeping it around just, it's like you blew a fucking tire on the highway going 150 miles an hour. so I think any political movement worth this salt going to have as an assumpd assumed assumed basic premise the constitution gotts to go. now of course that's not a thing you impose from outside, i just think it's a thing that an organic marxist, not through ideology but through lived practice, recognizing class is real, recognizing class conflict is is the only meaningful uh uh the only meaningful pursuit of justice, but the problem is one of the just that's an ideological question, how do you fight a civil war on behalf of a document that you then destroy and tear up, you know, i mean and obviously the evolution, the war changed the war aims of the union army and the the american the northern publics generally, but it wasn't you know supernatural, it was it was it was a was a process and it was unevenly distributed certainly, but that that uh that drive to preserve. the union, america as an idea that was a real motivating factor for people to join the army, obviously at a certain point you join because there's $100 in it for you or there's a draft, but those early regiments that you know spilled blood and run and whatnot, they had that as a motivation, there had to have been more pressure placed on the constitution for it to uh for it to come under the pressure necessary. and it never happened, probably couldn't have, but man, it's past time to recognize the the enemy for what it is. uh, esperanto, esperanto is one of those really adorable 19th century grasps towards the notion of you know true universal human consciousness. but it rests adorably on an idealist pedestal of like pure liberalism? buse, i think like the idea of creating a language for everybody in the world to speak is beautiful in a way, but the idea that it by its nature of its existence would naturally find itself over time to become a lingua franca, that is, that's what happens when you don't recognize material conditions is the generator of the shit. but one day there probably will be only one language on this planet, before there are no humans, the last of them will probably speak amongst them one language, but who knows how long that'll take. I'll go out with a soy face here. Apparently I'm on the first page, I'm going to look it up right now, I'm on the first you uh google image page for soy face, let me check if that's still sure, yep, first row. I did the Ecky, I did it, I did the egggy, I'm a soy man, I'm a soy man, I'm a soy man. I did not invent the soy face, of course that was the Nazis, uh, of course are the other side of the coin, these are the people who went through the college washing machine and came out opposed to it. now once again, not necessarily went to college, but experienced college in the form of culture generated by the college mindset, your peps, your groipers, they are their relationship to politics is as sterile and doomed as the relationship of the democrats broadly speaking, they will continue to be disillusioned by the party failing to do what it really wants. to do because they have some coqueed idea that they're representing some actual ideology and some actual like notion of the good, which is what they got from college, even though they don't know that, so they're constantly having to do the same pathetic uh uh bargaining game with their party, some of them are moving in the other direction, there are a number of outright people who have become like a kind of burny. trats right in the past uh in the past couple years if I'm not mistaken that's the same process moving in the other direction and then the question becomes when they hit the the zero barrier and breach do they recognize that they are in a sterile loop that their relationship of politics is illusory and fantastical and that they need to refound give it a new foundation or they just keep moving on and now they're going to be like the the most grouipery uh uh leftist and then move their way through somehow. you will continue to cycle through eternally if you can't give up your libidinal commitment to one party or another, one spectacle or another, one feast of domination over another. Yeah, the proud boys are the DSA of the right, it's the same college graduated losers with a different cultural uh satism box and a different cultural grievance collection uh trying to uh act out a online on concept of their political identity that is so powerful that it is spilled out into the real world, they have to affirm. uh in real life, but of course only in the most spectacular way possible, because they're fully atomized, and if they're more violent than DSA and you say, that's not, that's not a good comparison because DSA is not violent, they don't do things, antiif and violent, it's like they are on the right, so of course they're more concentrated in their violence as politics, because that's what right-wing politics is. It's the remember the fascism you talk about, aestheticization of politics, instead of doing violence on behalf of a class project, doing violence for its own sake, so of course they're going to be more violent, now of course the DSA is actually doesn't really have a right-wing comparison because of how demobilized they are, plot boys aren't a good really comparison, because but they're the closest thing there is, which just shows you how un' organized, it is on the right, how atomized it is, because they don't even have the fake solidarity of you, the grasping towards - you know, a public good. that once again is no one's fault and we're all including myself operating from it, it is the confusion of our labinal self-interest with our understanding of a general self, a general interest, we're only grasping at it, we're only guessing because we're not coordinating action through experience and through class consciousness, whatever you want to call it, and that's all of us, there's no blaming people, it's not saying anyone is bad for doing it, like i said, there's and no one is worse than me or better than me because I am 100% implicated in every single thing I'm talking about, and I think people in uh DSA, there's nothing that says they can't do great work within it and outside of it, but because it's going to be doing the work in the real world that they're going to find what works both inside and outside the organization, and doing anything to stay in. the real world is worth doing, no matter how cringe it may be, and no matter how politically sterile it might seem, because if it feels to you in the moment like it's worth your contribution, if you see things in the world that you and the people within that organization feel like you can do, then by god, keep doing it, if it feels good, as they say, do it, but when i mean good i mean actually satisfying of a, a material. political will to power, a materialized material will to power, as opposed to a fantasized one, and that's in DSA, it's outside of DSA, it's wherever you are, but it's you have to drop the sharad, that you're finding anything other than uh pleasure from this pantamime and the spectacle of like political combat as you understand it, all right, I got to go guys, talk to soon, peace.
