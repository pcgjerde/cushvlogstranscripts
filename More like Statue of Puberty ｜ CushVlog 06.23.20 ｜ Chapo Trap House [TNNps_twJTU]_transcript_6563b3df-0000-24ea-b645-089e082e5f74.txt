 Oh, I hate these add breaks, I got to wait forever to find out if I'm actually on the thing stream or not, there's got to be a better way. Oh, wait a minute, I didn't click on it, idiot, now it's the commercial, there I am, there's me, hello. I'm on tv on the internet, how's everybody doing? Everybody feeling good, feeling good, woo, all right, uh, what's up, beautiful day here, beautiful day, not too hot, the backyard grilling zone is uh, got a nice cool breeze running through it, we got the sink back here, all the trees, it's it's very nice, but uh, I do think I should get. some more plants back here, if i sign a if i keep this place for another year, i'll definitely get trees or get plants for next uh, next spring, it's a chill zone and a grill zone, it's true, so i was thinking about continuing on something i was talking about yesterday uh talk about statues cuuse apparently that's what uh the protest now about getting rid of statues, whether it's good to do that, I think if anybody saw the stream yesterday, they know where I would, they imagine where I would probably be on that, and they're correct, this is another example of people dealing with or refusing to deal with, the lack of a structure, the lack of any kind of meaningful deliverative brody that can create policy and then implement it through people who are dedicated to a cause, it's all we really have is a bunch of people who are sick of bullshit and are doing what they think will expresses their their uh their sickness of said bullshit uh but the problem comes and this is the exact same thing that happened with occupy uh is that because you don't have deliberative processes and you don't have discipline within a movement uh people kind of gravitate towards certain things and as actions as goals that substitute for the greater goal that is not really uh pursuable without a structure like you need a structure to really pursue the kind of huge radical changes to policing that are being demanded right now and we don't have that um so people point to people gravitate towards things in front of them that have a concrete meaning that occupy that meant eventually the occupy movement became about staying in the park and was it was specifically we're going to stay here, nothing more dramatic than that, which meants that when when they decided to break it up that was pretty much the end of it, and now we're in a similar situation, at least it looks like we'll see, like i said everything is changing and nothing is is is fixed, but the momentary conditions are that knocking over statues feels really good and so people want to knock over statues and God bless them, go for it, you know, as a team-building exercise, what could be figuring out how to pull some stupid uh, chinsy confederate uh factory made hollow fucking easter uh bunny ass piece of shit uh sculpture down, uh, that's my funniest thing about all these, all those daughters of the the American Revolution, confederate monuments that are up there, they're all absolute dog ship, they're holo, they cost like five bucks, they're mas produced, it was all part of a propaganda campaign at the time, at the turn of the century, they're not art in any meaningful sense, so people are knocking them over and they're having fun, people like, hey, let's knock over columbus, let's knock over the founding fathers, let's knock over us grant, which i mean i get what they're doing, i wouldn't do that, i would knock over, i would knock over a grant statute, but i can't really blame anybody for doing whatever they want, because like i said, all we're doing is determining the moral morality of the action, because the question of whether it's an effective or meaningful thing is beside the point because we couldn't stop them if we wanted to, nobody can stop anybody from doing anything because nobody is ordering anyone to do anything because there's no structure. the hope of this burning's campaign in my mind, the big hope was to give structure to the the the the burgening alienation with uh with capitalism as it's being practiced in this country, and uh sadly it did not have last long enough and then it ran head long into the social isolation of COVID to do that, and now people are once again trying to re reimagine a um a practice without uh, without a movement and without. coordination, coordination is the most important part, coordination is what takes the numbers, the raw numbers and makes them effective. coordination was what makes it possible for you to do thing like shut down the ports like they did uh last week in San Francisco, but that's because that's a fucking union and it's a radical union, one of the most radical unions in the country still uh the dock workers there, guss hall's old union, communist party hot bed throughout the 20th century. uh now we the rest of the country doesn't have that and so something like pulling down a statue feels like it's it's it's doing something but it's not really i mean you could pull down statues as part of celebration of a new power taking put coming in and changing you know the the the cultural matrix the cultural value system but pulling down the statues doesn't make that happen uh it's the... result of the fact that we have totally confused the symbolic and and the material realms and we really do think because we operate almost exclusively in our lives at the symbolic level that fucking with the symbolic order will somehow filter down to change the material conditions and it don't work that way uh changes changes that appear that that occur purely at the symbolic and cultural level will be recuperated always by the material conditions if they don't change. so that's why it's always a bummer to see something like okay now we're all going to talk about statues and who should pull down and who should go up. i'm actually with Matt bruding in the idea that there shouldn't really be statues of individuals that's kind of messed up really, i mean you're turning this person into a god. i mean, that's what they did in they did a statue of like uh caesar or fucking uh titus or something, they were that was part of the beautification of of of the emperors. "the only humans, the only humans that should have statues are fictional characters like Robocop and the fons, or local heroes, like some guy who like assembled a really big ball of twine or uh, you now save some babies for a from a from a well or something, I mean my god, you know, you really think humans make history individually, what are you 12? "we are all merely uh able to operate in the narrow confines given to us by our place and time and birth, the idea that any that people, individuals make history, no, they make that individuals make history, but not as they please, as Mark said, and uh, but anyway, so I don't really care about the statues either way, I don't care if we get rid of every statue, David Roth is pointed out, they're not even good to look at, they're based." they're almost always the most boring part of any public uh uh public art uh installation uh abstract statues tend to be much more interesting than ones of specific people uh, but the degree to which the moment becomes about defending or condemning the removal of statues is the degree to which people have given up on changing the actual conditions and turn them into a fight over symbols, a culture war as it were. and I could very well see a world where by November uh the entirety of this moment of of unrest and revolt has been boiled down to a ye yes no question about like should we get rid of Mount Rushmore or something like that but it doesn't have to be that way things can change things are always changing just saying right now it's not a good development that I'm I'm not personally terribly thrilled with it uh and It's it certainly doesn't speak to strength, it speaks to confusion and um and powerlessness, but that is the defining characteristic of Americans, so it makes sense. uh, I will say that the uh, that the that the re-litigating the civil war uh and what caused it, I'm always up for that, because that's one where it's like really a slam dunk. like there's no way to argue with it, there's only, the only way you can make it arguable is if you decide to pull some sort of retorical trick and change definitions or something. the the the sectional crisis in america. that led to the civil war was caused by one thing above all else that on the continent of the United States uh the the land, the the rich black soil that allowed for uh mass cultivation of staple cash crops, not staple crops, cash crops like tobacco and cotton was largely confined to the southern states and the thing about cash crops is in a context like America right, where you've cleared out the native inhabitants, and you have this huge tracks of free real estate as uh, Tim Heidicker would call it, the only way that you can get that you can create an economy of scale there that will make growing something like cotton or tobacco uh profitable is if you have basically free or low - incredibly low cost uh labor and the problem with that from a colonial like a the perspective of a of the colonizers was even if they wanted to use colonizers to do that they couldn't have because when you have that kind of uh of abundance that kind of abundance in real estate as it were there's no way in hell that you could pay people enough to do the work cu it sucks, it's fucking terrible. the reason that they were able to put all those britss into the dark satanic mills is that they'd enclosed all the free pasture lands before that, they people had no condition, they had nowhere to go, all the land was owned, they had nothing to do but work in the factories. in a colony, no no colonist could ever be made to work picking cotton at a price that would make picking that cotton worth picking, worth worth creating a profit for the... rester for the person who the the the aristocrat on the land, because they could just leave, they could just go get they say fuck you, i'll go over the village, i'll go over the thing and i'll i'll just i'll live in the in the hills, i'll i'll grow corn and i'll make whiskey just like they did in the north, just like the small colonist in the north in analatia, the person who's doing that uh that work has to have no choice, they have to have nowhere to go, so hey, if their skin brands them as part of a a a class that is unfree labor, then they don't have any options, they have to work for whatever uh, they have to work for for on the terms of their owner, as it work, because they've been pulled out of their uh, their where they're from, the first generations of slaves had no no English language, uh, total disorientation across the land and then put into a place where there's nowhere to go. because if you're there, people know you're not supposed to be, and that's a thing that they could never have done to any coluis and that's why indentured servitude kind of went away over time because they say fuck you, and that's where it all started from, like everyone wants to talk about like oh it was a tariffs or whatever, it's like well yeah but why did the south not want tariffs because they were an export economy buse they were exporting content like the that was it because they it was a it was a classic uh uh ladafundis situation where you had these these decadent uh plantation owners with no interest in seeing development, they didn't care about roads and and schools and any of that bullshit, they wanted profits for them, and that meant low tariffs so that they could sell uh, so that they could um so that they could pay as little as possible for imports. in the north they have industry because they didn't have those juge swaves of bottom land that could be turned into slave plantations, people had to work is the yoman farmers, the flinty New England farmers, the're called flinty because New England soil is basically rocks, so everything that comes out of it, all the conflicts, all the conflicts that you can point to and say it wasn't slavery, it was x, it wasn't slavery, it was y, they all emate from that structural material reality. the necess the necessity of slave labor to make plantation agriculture viable, over time that changes as the mechanicschange or whatever, but at the in in the early stages when you create the structures that then become self-reproducing social orders, which the south created very quickly, that wasn't the case, and so that means that during the civil war the union was uh the progressive side, i mean if you're talking about good guys, guys that's dumb because that doesn't really apply historically, that's not really a thing uh, for the most part in in terms of like grand sweep, like individuals can behave virtuously, but but for the most part states don't, they they operate from. what they perceive as self-interest, and so you have different self-interest between uh, the northern sort of political uh class, the hegemonic political class in the north and the southern political class, hegemonic political class in the south, remember there are tons of white southerners who didn't want to break away and in fact fought the confederacy and resisted it being drafted and um and in the case of western Virginia literally seceded from it um and those places coincidentally were the places where plantation agriculture was least prevalent because it was too hilly, it was too rocky, wherever there were mountains in the south, eastern Carolinas, the Western Carolinas, eastern Tennessee, Kentucky, western Virginia, northern, northern, even in the deep deep south, there were huge pockets of resistance to the confederacy in northern, IE appelatian, um, Mississippi and Alabama. but the America was the progress, the United States, the Union was the progressive force uh, and I think like there's there is this sort of like two clever by half leftist move sometimes to say, a lot of this actually you see with - like black radicalism and stuff that that doesn't want to give the white man any credit, which hey, I understand not wanting to give white people any credit for anything, but where it says, oh, the north was actually just trying to clamp down and impose like its industrial capitalist. hell uh economy on the rest of the the country, and the thing is is that that didn't really exist yet in 1860, it was still in its, it was still a proto, i mean the the vast majority of of America's of the continent that was made in the south went to Europe, went to England specifically, because that's where the industrial is issuing started earliest, and that's where it was most intense, that's where the the capacity for turning raw cotton into a finished linen. whatever was was most uh advanced. the US didn't become an industrial economy really until after the civil war for the same reason that the British did. war is a capital is a war tends to in the modern context uh accumulate capital in such a way to to to boost all of the the the the present but uh the present conditions uh the present progressive moves towards industrialization all like if if you have a process of industrialization, it is radically accelerated by war, by the by by the state investment in industry that comes with fighting a war. uh, we were made into industrial capitalist society by the civil war, the same way that the napoleonic wars are what made England into the paramount industrial power of the 19th century, but nobody knew that at the time, guys like Lincoln weren't fighting for industrial. they were fighting for the wig ideal which was the small holding farmer in equal competition with uh or in an equal position with all other uh strata of society when it comes to rights and abilities uh and in an equal position with anyone who would hire him because you could get land and of course this is all based on expropration of native American land, it's all based on it's the the and that is the foundational difference between the United States and and the European countries were always comparing ourselves to, the cultural, all the cultural distinctions come from the reality of a continent's worth of land that has been decided is free, because the people who are on it aren't really people as they as uh, Tim Robinson would say on, they they uh, so I think you should leave, they're not really supposed to be here, it's okay, that's what uh, that's what makes America what it is, big idea was, like I said, if you get rid of slavery, and and the white man is not competing with slaves, and this became eventually the hegemonic belief of uh, of white northerners generally, including democrats, which is what led to the Democratic Party breaking up in 1860, uh, is that they would not accept a uh, a southern candidate, they would, they the northern democrats would not accept the the the southern half of the party dictating their candidate, which... before they would have been fine with, but by 1860 uh the the the sexual crisis and specifically the border war in Kansas had really changed that and and uh white people, white men in the north were becoming more and more aware of the idea that they were in competition in some way with slavery as a economic institution uh and so they they were like, no, we don't want that. the the wig idea that that Lincoln ended up uh taking to the white house was, you get rid of slavery and every every man will have the freedom to either engage in uh profitable work for an employer or if they don't like those conditions they can fuck off and be a yoman farmer because look what we just did with Homestead Act, I mean that the homestead act was America's land reform agenda, the kind of thing that uh would have been impossible in in any European country without a war, and and the thing that led to most of the right-wing cous in Latin America uh, in the in the 20th century was land reform, we were able to do it because the people we were excorporating land from weren't existing stakeholders, like united fruit or whatever in central America in the 50s, they were native american tribes. of what we consider to be the polity and so they could be pushed aside and that gave this that open these huge expanses and that created this this notion that hey we can have like an igalitarian the jeffersonian model made real, but of course over the course of the war to defend that you create this industrial beheemeth that pretty much that in the decades after this of war swallows everything and then i think what a lot of people do is they look backwards through that lens and say this was and everyone at the time knew they were doing this, and neither of those is true. i i hope nobody is thinking that um, i'm saying that like slaves couldn't resist their slave and of course they did, but it was sure, it was, it was a categorically different thing to try to. uh withhold labor as an enslaved person with with your with your color branding your position as one as a slave uh then a colonist who's like hired who would hypothetically be hired to pick cotton and then could literally just walk off whenever he wanted to if he wasn't getting enough money to make it worthwile to do and there was no and there was no way that could have worked because the thing about those um uh those large scale uh cash crop industries is that the actual u work was awful, i mean cotton wasn't even the worst of it, sugar was honestly uh one of the most nightmarish existences possible being a slave on a sugar plantation, there's not enough money you could pay a free person to make them do that, especially in a condition where they could of material abundance where they could find their own sustance elsewhere. i saw the... travel stimulus thing, god that's so funny, this here's here's a tax credit to go on a vacation, just so adorable, you think a democrat would have come up with that one, oh it's so good, and of course it's not even a free money, it's a goddamn tax credit, which means you have to have four grand that you don't that you cannot see until next year in your tax return, wild, as we know, before covid, something like half of Americans don't have $500. to go through an emergency uh uh situation and yet no, they're going to do it so that everybody who has four grand to sit to not be in their bank account for a year or more shit and to go on vacation when the goddamn virus is still everywhere when it's going like wildfire through all of the red states as anyone could have predicted the whole time we were sitting sitting tight here in New York and all the fucking rubes were were. yuck yucking, the reply was just wait, and now whom could have predicted except everyone, that's what's happening, so you're saying, hey, you guys, go into the heart of a of of a plague outbreak or come from one to a place that doesn't have one, one way or another, make sure to mix it up, make sure to mix it up, you could just give people the money, you could keep people the money, which would stimulate local economies and that would even affect. that have a tourist based economy because people still live there and they still have to live you know buy things but it's harder because they don't have income well you replace the income how about that with actual money oh dear how can you imagine can you imagine such a thing uh but mcsally's cook uh she's going to go down as like an all-time loser losing losing getting appointed to a - a seat, losing it, then get appointing to a different seat and then losing that one. Scott Brown level loser. Oh yeah, Scott Brown, Scott Brown won election, Mally was just appointed, two time loser. I do like the idea though of giving people for grand that they can only spend on a vacation, I mean that would be dumb too, you should just keep people money without strengths attached, you should always just be keeping as long as we're in this hell world, hell economy and as long as as long as we're just at the level of demanding uh, you know re uh redistribution rather than of of money. and power for the love of God, just give people money, strengths attached, but the idea of giving people four grand, but they have to take a vacation, I would love to just see what people did with it, people who'd never taken a vacation before, they're not going to let that because it's like you either use it or you don't get it, so it's like who you want, fuck it, let's do it, and people who've never taken like a a never gotten an airplane before or whatever, or people who would never think to travel are now doing it, where would you go, yeah, like, it would be like a bruster's million situation uh, and that would be awesome. I mean, if we're gonna have, we're going to be wacky, have fun, let's go all the way, like the tax, the tax incentive thing is awful, buse yeah, it's just it's just the same rich assholes that go on vacation anyway, only now they get to do it for free, make people spend the money on a vacation, real money, like give it to them in a form of like a uh, of like a debit card that's only accepted at certain places, like it's only accepted by airlines, you know, the same way like a wick card is. you can't buy hot food or whatever uh can only buy uh airline tickets and hotels and like uh restaurants in cities that it knows you don't live in. i do love the idea of somebody taking four grand to go like just themselves for grand to go to wisconsin dells and just live like an absolute maniac at the dells like just tipping tipping tipping the kid at the Tommy Bartlet thrill world when you come in demanding backstage access at noas arc to see where they like skim out all the shit and whatever. but i think that's i mean that and that would be such a perfect emblematic moment like the country is clearly teetering on the edge of some sort of significant, i don't want to say collapse because that does sound alarmist and institutions. like these often are more resilient than you think they are, like i've often pointed out, the world economy still needs America to be the uh the employer of last of the consumer of last resort, but it's we're still clearly uh in a freefall away from uh even the meager status, the megerly satisfying and in fact mostly miserable status quo that we were slowly coming to climatized to even that's going away and in the meantime just have everybody go on vacation go on a state subsidized vacation like some like Russian factory workers going to the fucking black sea on on like a on a on a package deal with everyone else on their shift amazing let's do it yeah that'd be funny take four grand to Cuba and just like give it to the government. China has been building counter higemy has it cuuse it does really seem to me that right now China has basically just at a joined a hegem I mean they have they have there's still like geopolitical rivalry between the United States and uh and the US or the United States and China but it seems to me that it's mainly over. to be in charge of the higem, which is different than like the existential conflict of the cold war. i want to, i want to find like the shittiest tourist spot in america, a place where no one would ever go, like um, oh, you know what would be funny, go to fucking uh, go to the goddamn corn palace and wall south. the uh or waldrug, that's it, go to waldrug in South Dakota, one of the stupidest, chinciest fucking awful lame uh tourist attractions in the entire country, if anyone doesn't know what I'm talking about, it's actually a genius of marketing uh, so there in South Dakota, there's one, I forget which one, but there's a highway that runs along like the southern track of it, that if you're going cross country is usual, I was going, I was driving cross, I was driving halfway cross country, I was driving from Wisconsin'. in Washington state and the way to do that fastest is you just cut through a highway that just goes all the way straight across southern uh the south quarter South Dakota. It is the most the most. desolate empty stretch of road i have ever encountered in the country and i've driven cross country several times, i've been through Kansas, i've been through a lot of very empty up into the high desert, nothing is as desolate feeling as south dakota, it is genuinely like empty, you know, just fields, fields, no animals even fields. no cops, i didn't see a cop on the highway the whole time, i got fucking pulled over five minutes after i got in waoming though uh so your drive is incredibly featureless and so on the way when you're going east to west there are a bunch of billboards i don't know like every 50 miles or 100 miles or so that say coming up exit whatever wall drug and you just see it as you're driving it's the only thing you see is wall drug, exit upcoming, and you by the time you go through enough of South Dakota, you've been broken down mentally so much by the monotony that you've built up Waldruck in your head as some sort of paradise, so of course we stopped at waldrug, even though we didn't have to, their whole thing was free ice water, and we go there and it's just a giant drugstore that's like old tiny western themed and has like uh, you now um the walkways, the thorfair walkways with you the the the wood and it's got the overhang, it's like an old time like a western set, only it's just a giant drugstore with like a bunch a shit ton of um of very pedestrian uh uh souvenirs for like the black hills and shit uh and shit like oh look it's uh it's refrigerator magnet shaped like all states and then there's a couple of uh animatronics sort of like a country bear jambery only they do not go on you got to like press a button and i was in there for maybe 10 minutes and we got out i was like that's fucking so lame i hate it i want to take my $4,000 check from donald trump and go to waldrug just like give it to them and say can i stay here can i just like sleep here? in wall drug for four grand and like just take out a wheel a wheel barrel full of stuff, they probably say yes, but no, the pimp move, i've never driven through it since, but the pimp move, and this is i think what really distinguishes the alpha mindset from the beta, and i was a beta at the time, if you drive through South Dacota for the first time, you've not been to waldrug, you drive through South Dakota, you take that whole area, and you don't stop. That's the alpha, that's the chat posture, I did, I was the virgin, I learned my lesson, but sadly I can never prove it because now I know it sucks and you often see bumper stickers, because they sell bumper stickers to say Waldrug, and people get them and put them on their car, I think because they have such a deep association now between waldrug and their trip, because they just spent like a solid day just staring at billboards and said wal drug and the... feel like they're now in some way their trip and waldrug are the same and they've never left waldrug, they go into the bathroom of waldrug and there's an attendant there going, you've always been here, you've always been at waldrug, yeah i stayed a uh, i stayed a motel in Kadoka South Dakota, which is by wild coincidence, and i didn't even realize this until years later, that's also where uh where Michael Clark Duncan's character has to get picked up by the FBI during the gather the crew montage in Armagedden, but anyway stayed a motel there, it was one motel in an inner on and off ramp, no town, it wasn't part of you, where you see like 15 best westerns and lakintas or whatever and there's mcdonald's and fucking friendlys in a chuckle fucks, just off ramp, sind basically like a fucking cinderblock low. uh motel and that's it and it had a it had a screen it had a glass sliding door and it smelled like someone had died in it not been murdered but like mummified by time yeah south dakota black hills are nice uh mount rushmore lame not just because it's a bunch of presidents on sacred Indian land although that is disgusting, it is also chinsy and shitty, stuff like mount rushwar really it does is the like cuz uh mount rushnar was a huge project at the time, i mean obviously it took years, it was a massive under taking it it gathered America's imaginations uh the the this is an interesting uh factory Gutson Borglum the non-American who designed Mount Rushmore uh when he was in the United States he became uh very very taken with southern culture as it were and uh he helped he designed stone mountain there which is another etching on the side of a bluff of a bunch of a Lee Davidson Jackson uh and he joined the KKK. but anyway, this is like a symbol of American culture, right? like like when when when the anglo-saxon weirdo types like when when when the deck when when the western architecture type guys show their pictures of don draper and they're like, what we what we used to have, like their idea of culture is shit like mount rushmore and it fucking sucks, it's lane, it's really small. and it's it's just its face is on a mountain, i mean other than like the kind of goolish uh uh uh you know Alan Moore style like evil ritual magic of putting that on the land of the sacred land of a people who'd been uh massacred by the people on those fucking on that like there's a dark majesty to that there's like an evil there's kind of an arbart marked fry feeling to it that sort of curdled uh curdled sarcasm and cynicism that's at the heart of authoritarianism, the culture is dog shit, and i really love to see some tanks, you know what i would like to see, if somebody's gonna destroy mount rushmore and someone's gonna destroy stone mountain, i would love it, but if it's like some corporate PR move uh, you know like uh, coca-cola presents stone mountain and the... just like put Donald Glover there next to them to balance it out or something and outcast, that will suck, what would be awesome is if those things got destroyed with some good old fashion tank rounds, roll in some Abraham's tanks, set up the shot and just blow them up like that old news real shot of that uh of that big swastic on i think in Nurremburg getting blown up by a cannon. and you know why that would be cool? because if you've got tanks that means you have a control of the state and you are instituting a new rule at the material level and you're blowing up those old monuments to a dead society because you are building a new one. that is the iconiclasm that i would love to see and i and i the the the current one just feels like a very honestly kind of... sad substitution, yeah, oh god, straping run of a10 wardhogs with the fucking fucking stonewall jackson's head just, but you need to get the tanks first, so the next time you imagine, oh i really want to get rid of that statue, it's like do you really want to get rid of it, if you really want to get rid of. you'll do it from a position of authority so that you're you're you're you are inshrining a new order, a new just order, you're not painting over the vasade of a rotten old order, which is all we're trying to do right now, see that's why i don't like that like that that's always been the thing that's annoyed me, or i guess not even annoyed me, you amused me about the con the word tanky. either as something that people use as a term of abuse or as something that people self-describe with. where are the tanks? what tanks are you referring to? there's no tanks. 1956 the so they were talking about soviet tanks rolling into uh budapest. what tanks are you talking about now? i mean, some people would say like a Assad, or maybe like the the chinese or something like that. uh, and I guess like that's an argument. I don't buy it, but it's an argument, but unless you have that belief. like no, it's the PRC, that's an actual like socialist counterhegemity with billionaires uh, that's doing actual colonialism, uh, but never mind, they're all secret communists, if you want to believe that that's fine, at least there's a tank in your mind that exists in the real world that somebody could drive somewhere, for anyone else, it's like there's no tanks, you're assuming a tank, so that means that you're like operating from the assumption of a party in power. the communist party of the Soviet Union controlling a state and a geostrategic sphere of influence and managing it like in the game Twilight struggle. ideology is from the position of maintaining that position, that is not the current position of the left in this country or the west or anywhere I would argue, except for, maybe maybe you can argue Cuba and I think I mean they have power within their own country, but it's so constrained by us, you know, but they were able to kick the fucking South Africans out of uh Namibia, so maybe I'll say can't uh Cuba, but like they can't really, it's they're an unrealistic, they're bastion. but they cannot be a counterhegimon because they're too small, they're too tidy, the little guys, their tanks aren't going to be able to roll up on our tanks, for example, we have to take over the tanks, we got to get in the tanks somehow, tearing down statues, somebody is asking tearing down statues is I would say it can be something if it does what the what the person writing suggested, which is give people a sense of possibility changing to give them a sense that things can be different, but if it's just a sense of that, once again, we're anywhere, it has to arise, it has to that feeling, that feeling of things are possible has to be channed into some sort of container. something that that that where decisions can be where a a class of where a plan of action, where an actual strategy can be deliberated, agreed to and then carried out, that has to exist, that has to be made, so if pulling down statues gets people thinking, this is worth enough time and energy and investment into into making those structures, then it's useful, if it says hey, we pull down these statues. Maybe that means we can pull down these other bigger statues, hey, we pull down the statue of these confederates, maybe that means we can pull down the statues of these unions are uh uh generals, because they were racist too, and they killed a lot of Indians as well, and and America is bad, and then maybe we can pull down uh uh, you know, and then you got Shawn King saying, hey, let's also start destroying images of white Jesus. Shan King is not right, by the way, if you think Shaon Shan King is right, you're either a moron or you are like him a cop. I'm sorry, sorry, nope. I mean you can argue why that's theoretically right all day, but once again you are building the world's stupidest and most pointless ship in the world's most fragile bottle, you're in the real world, what is what is advanced, how would you go about doing that, and what would be advanced by doing it? answer me, someone in here who thinks that's a good idea answer me one of those two questions. "the thing is is that people justify that these weird labitinal indulgences by saying, yeah, but they deserve it, and I got a quote, Sean Penn here, deserves not got nothing to do with it, nobody deserves anything, none of us have free will to each other, like I said, we all have free will ourselves because we are ignorant of what is making us do what we're doing, but from outside of ourselves." looking at everyone else, no one else has free will, because we can determine why they're doing what they're doing. so getting mad at everybody and talking about deserve and and vengeance at a personal level just reififies this all as a culture war, because where else can you fight out these sort of battles about about points of eticat, essentially social eticat, you can say that they're important and they are, but they boil down to ways of acting in public, which is eticat. how do you adjudicate that at any level other than the cultural? that's the only place you'll ever be able to negotiate those those those arguments and they won't filter down because anything the challenges from the from the culture gets fucking recuperated until it can't because of overspill and that comes because because people channel it, people create a collective will out of a out of a class consciousness and effect chance. in which uh capitalism operates to either the point of a reform or to the point of abolition. but the thing that people shouldn't do and that i see too many people do is just decide to write everything off because of these facts as though we don't live in a highly mediated society as though this isn't always the hardest problem isn't always going to be to ree socialized people who have been desocialized by their their entire lives and that this is exactly how things would be uh be challenged like the the rejoinder uh about the protest that is always most baffling to me is when people say look uh look at all these corporations that like it and look at all these uh brands and celebrities and famous rich people who are coopting it it's like they're trying to recuperate it that's what capitalism does to all challenges to it in any way. They might succeed, but pointing out that they're trying, isn't saying anything. Oh god, and that's the other thing, it's like someone says, maybe this makes people feel like you know things are possible, but look where the movement is happening, like now, we've literally gone another level of abstraction away from actual statues and real physical space. to now television shows and not even new ones, doing a cultural revolution about 20 year old programs, that ain't good, that's not progress, that is more flight from the lack of uh accountability, in fact none of us are accountable to each other, because we have not, we have not invested any any symbols. or people or institutions with uh authority over us, which we're going to have to do, at some point we're all going to have to, if if if if if the left coaleces in anything meaningful in this country, at some point we are all going to have to submit in that we are going to have to give up some control over our lives, some control over of what we do, some control over when we do it, some control over ourselves. to someone else in the form of a um organization that will have central discipline because that's the only way you get to do you you can apply force is through coordination otherwise it's just undirected force is is destroyed in peace meal only unify coordinated force can push through you guys ever see uh you guys ever see finding dory what? one of the most moving scenes in finish cinema history in my opinion, it's when towards the end when Dory and uh the Albert Brooks are swimming in a big sea of dumb ass fish that are just all going, and they get caught in a fucking one of those big old industrial fishing uh uh nets, and they're getting pulled up and they're all going to get oh god we're going to get turned into fish sticks and all the fish are swimming crazily wildly and against the the the net but by their own... instinct and then Dory and Albert Brooks get them to stop freaking out and they go in one direction, they all swim down at the in this point in the same way, and the fucking net breaks off of the fucking rope, that is, that is the labor movement, that is the left, that's the modern left, and when it succeeds any? way and that's the goal, that's the entire thing, finding nemo, whatever, if you're not pushing in the same direction, it's just going to get, it's just your your individual effort will eventually be re uh diffused, see and that's the thing, we can't communicate to each other, but the thing is we are, I really think a big part of it is, it's not just it isn't just that we're all isolated, physically and that we don't have uh like we don't have hegemonic uh institutions of communication that we can like invest enough uh belief into to to credit what they're saying so that we can build like a ideology that or build a class consciousness like simultaneously by listening to the same because not enough of us are listening to the same thing with the same amount of uh credulity. that is a problem, but i'd say another problem. is that we have been turned into such individuals, we we fetishize our individual desires, so much, we have been had it grained into us so much that freedom is our ability to uh indulge our desires, like that's why you see a lot of people correctly say capitalism isn't freedom because you are forced to work uh you know and and um you'd be freeer if you had more vacation answer is what i want to do, but of course you don't want to do what you want to do, none of us want to do what we want to do, we don't, we do what we have been taught to want to do, and that means that we bound up with our notion of the society we want, a lot of things that are coping mechanisms for the society. we have, things that wouldn't be necessary in a new society we're building and that we can let go of in the immediate moment if we're reorienting ourselves around a project, an actual project that we wanted to see executed, we can kind of luck drop those things, but nobody wants to drop it, nobody wants to drop it because we don't have anything that we really believe in enough to invest that much faith into to give up something that till this point has been helping us, just helping us live with the horror of the world around us, not realizing that if we drop that, the work will fill the whole, the submission will be the freedom, because you will feel fulfilled, you will feel the sort of satisfaction that what the other thing you used to fetishize only gave you a fay a very faint echo of. but you have to have faith to make the first jump and nobody believes in anything enough to make the first jump, so that's a problem that we had to deal with, the problem we all live with, as Norman Rockwell said, the name, that's the name of his um, that's the name of his famous painting of uh, the what was her name, the girl who de uh desegregated, i think the New Orleans school district, i'm actually drinking chocolate milk, favorite cut of french fry, i've yet to encounter in a french fry that's better than the mcdonald's french fried, i i consider that suigenarus. and a piping hot mcdonald's french fry is genuinely delicious, ruby bridges, that's the right name, one of the most uh chaotic uh things about uh amber is that she likes like room temperature mcdonald's french fries which is blows my mind but the hot ones and i know yeah i probably had better like individually but just as a category my experience with them is better than my experience. with any other discrete category of fry. i do kind of like the string uh the shoe strings. i like them shoo stringi. i like the crispy, i don't like the thick. i don't like steak fries. i don't like it where it's got like the papy potatoe flavor in the middle. i like it when it's um, i like it when it is crisp. I never get fries popies because I don't like the because I only get the uh buse popies why would you get anything as the side but the mashed potatoes many many french fries one of his one of the feuest moments he had fun in his presidency uh handsome handsome handsome quarterback hamburger party the truck. when he got to ride the truck, when they put him on the aircraft carrier and he wore the uniform uh, and when he gave the medal to the hero dog, those were those were moments that were nice, but the thing is he hasn't thought about them since they happened, he was happy for a second and then he was thinking about how unfair greet van sustern was to him, that's and then it's gone, so like he doesn't even remember those days. I love culvers, culvers are great, Wisconsin excellence right there, butterburgers, you know it, oh put the fries in the mashed potatoes, okay now you get... interesting, get an extra side, all right, I might do it, I definitely pity Trump, Trump's miserable, I mean, you should, you should have like some sort of, you should try to extend empathy to every human being, because every single person is only where they are through the happen stance of their life, what, what and when they encountered people and places and things. and because their their response to those that might seem to be self-generated was really just a reaction that is so that is that was bubbled up in the subconscious that is never even thought of, that was beyond thought, so even though it's totally determined with but within the psyche it's completely invisible and mysterious, so nobody's nobody's where they are for any malevolence within them, i mean the malevolence builds over time. the malevalence has turned towards, but it's all in the in the in the context of of where and when they they existed. so yeah, i empathized with Hitler, i emphathize with everybody a little bit, but the thing is, because no one, because within Hitler, if you're imagine you're Hitler, you imagine you're Trump, you don't know, you don't know how determined you are, you can choose to break out of that, you can choose toward to to turn towards good. turn towards uh uh truth turns towards universal humanity, turn towards uh an awareness of like what is, what is to be good, what the good represents, as in like the the fundamental union of all beings, the fundamental oneness of all in the universe, you can turn towards that at any minute, and if you don't you fucked up, and so you should be sanctioned and stopped from doing bad things and punished. Maybe you'll learn, and if you don't, at least you've been kept away from other people, but it doesn't mean that you have to hate personally, it doesn't mean that you have to deny someone, anyone the benefit of trying to extend your mind into theirs with their experience and try to piece it together, I mean Trump's very easy to piece together, his dad, his parents were monsters, his parents were essentially the the the father and mother from the people under the stairs, anybody seen that movie we the gimpsuit blown away blown holes on the walls, just complete psychopaths who treated their children with monstrous abusive disdain uh the and he had a brother he had an older brother Fred Jr. who who could not take it, who couldn't take the pressure, and because he was honestly, I think a better person than Trump in that he responded better to the traumas of his birth and his his childhood. left the family, ended up becoming a pilot, died of alcoholism, but that was because he couldn't take what they had done to him, uh, whereas Donald just became like the whipped dog, and now his entire life has been trying to get this fantasy monster, this this ghoul, and if anyone has seen a picture of Fred Trump, he is an actual walk living, he was a living skeleton to to. tell him he's good, which will never happen, and so he's been miserable every moment of his life, he's never been happy, that sucks, the thought of that, somebody you can never have a moment, who can never just exist for a second and not be beseset by demons, by by insecurity, by by loathing and fear of others, awful. Yeah, and Fred Trump's father did the same to him, awful fucking crypto nazi motherfuckers, the worst of the the the German authoritarian prussian lineage, those fucking Prussians, man, those sandy, stiff-necked assholes, Bavarians just want to party, Bavarians just want to wear leather shorts and drink comically large stighs of beer. Russians want to take over the... All right guys, uh, I'm done for today, this is a good one, Hitler was not bavarian, he was austrian, he did start in Munich, yes, but he never uh, the nazis never got a majority of the vote in Bavaria or any of the catholic parts of Germany because of the center party, which was explicitly catholic, um, he ran up all of his big margins in protestant parts of Germany. Anyway we'll talk more about that maybe in a different episode because it's very fascinating the the the uh like the electoral map of uh Yymart Germany very interesting uh bye bye
