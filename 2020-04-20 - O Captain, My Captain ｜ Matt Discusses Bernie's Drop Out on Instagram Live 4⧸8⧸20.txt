 the cat say by the house and the yanks they were withinkers boys the his advice that they were a king and they turn and shook and they had a look at the room where the dead man lay. RIP to a real one, I think I can say that with full earnestness, rip to maybe the realest one we've ever seen, uh, so obviously Berdie dropped out today, we're back where we started uh, eternal recurrence is a real bitch, fucking annoying, but nich you nailed that so well, asshole, fucking siphalitic missagenous weirdo, but he totally daled it, there's no question that we live in an internal recurrence, that is our fate, that is our doom uh, a lot of people are asking where do we go from here? that is the answer, i do not know the question, or that's the question, i do that the answer. uh, all i can say about that is that the one good thing for people, especially considering the real, you know, stressful crisis moment we're in for everyone, is that now you don't have to worry, there's one less thing to worry about, um, you don't have to worry about the presidential election anymore. like you can tone it out, you don't have to pay attention, there's no requirement for you to care about any of this stuff now, and that honestly after what now, four years or so of like like investing yourself in this shit, isn't that kind of a treat that in the midst of this shit you can just sort of like read a book, chill out, like try to pretent an expert on coronavirus or some shit, and you don't have to care about the presidency, you don't have to care about this. election, it means nothing, uh, it is the pay, you can be put finally and definitively on the pay, no mind list, we don't have to pay in any mind, and that's really nice, I'm looking forward to that, I'm looking forward to what we're going to do on the show, now that we don't have to talk about this topic, which honestly at this point getting pretty sick of, I mean, what else is to be said about the fucking, you know, this this mummy, this undead mummy murdering people sacrificicing like as a proof to their their faith of the democratic part. I mean what the hell else do you need to say about what's happening that is more damming than what they're actually doing so pay no mind uh so yeah beyond that I don't know like people talk about general strikes it's like with who you know what army like we don't have the people the whole point of the Bernie campaign was to get some numbers to get some numbers behind this whole thing to get some like some support. some critical maths and now that's pretty much off the table, so now what to do next becomes a question, but uh, i think people were like, all right, now we can do direct democracy, now we can do all this shit, it's like, well, we didn't have enough people before this, we don't have a good people now, so maybe we need to stop and think about that, i don't know the answers, um, i still have no idea, um, Fuck, I forgot something, I'll be right back. Smarna is like very outgoing, compassionate, she has lot of friends and she always. Uh, so I don't know what's happening, put the thing on, I listen, I listen, people say put the thing on, I put the thing on, um, like, what kills me and makes me sad about this is that, for myself personally, the reason i thought it was worthwhile to invest fully in the... campaign, it's because I recognized the chief problem of the left in this country was saying uh, was numbers, was people, was people who were invested and willing to do, willing to be activists in whatever way that meant, and uh, to you, do the work, whatever that meant, nobody knew, because it had never been an issue, we never had it, you know, we never had the numbers, I haven't had them for decades, burning was about getting the numbers. and getting a movement, oh almost fell off, that would have been epic too, uh, it was to get people on board and because there's going to be a crisis in capitalism, you know, it's like i didn't really know what Bernie was going to be able to accomplish as president, honestly didn't think that much, i wasn't really that, i mean i he had a lot of levers he could prash, but like he wasn't going to ch, he wasn't going to make revolution or anything like that, uh, what he was going to do was uh, uh, what he was going to do was create movement, create - create get an army, get people ready to go, at a time, as capitalism came closer to crisis, i mean what's killing me right now with this whole fucking coronavirus thing is just imagine if Bernie would had been president right now while this shit was going on as compares to what's happening now which is we're getting the 2008 bailout on steroids, we're getting um, we're getting another massive corporate handout, we're we're we're getting a situation where when this ends, if we still have an intact government and institutions then they're just going to be we literally will have used the federal treasury to keep hold the people who will just buy out everything that everybody lost during the course of this time. um and that would i mean I don't know what Bernie Presidency would have meant but this happening under Bernie President would not have meant that I can say that for sure and if it hadn't been a virus if it had been one of the indogenous crisis that are endemic to capitalism finally coming forward again which was on the verge of happening I mean the fucking bond markets and shit were going wild even before corona virus and there who knows if they're right in another thing. and um um and there people would have there would have been like a coherent response to this, there would have been a coherent notion of like a capitalist of like an alternative to the to a capitalist restructuring that we're going to get instead uh and that would have been true with a bernie presidency or post-Berny. moment when the crisis came and now the crisis is here and it's just too fucking early, it's just too fucking early and that's too bad, so the the task is still the same that it was without before Bernie, but now without Bernie, the question becomes what replaces Berniey as a mechanism for recruitment and mobilization. and i don't know, it's way too early to say, we'll talk about it, people have ideas, hey zling, how you doing? i don't know, i don't i mean it's too early, i think anybody, love you buddy, anybody who's uh claiming to know is fucking selling something. thing um uh but yeah like one way or another the key the fact is is that uh is that we're not prepared for this moment and Bernie represented the best chance to get people prepared for a moment like this and it didn't happen. and that's the real tragedy here uh, I'm not, as for what Bernie could have done differently, I think anybody arguing for any kind of specific like, oh, he should have done x, y and z, is really just arguing from their own like personal uh craw thing where they're like, oh, this is what I always wanted them to. do and coincidentally that's what he should have done you know it's like come on um uh why would you need to engage with biden supporters the republican the presidential election is no longer a zone of contention it's no longer a contest it's no longer a place to put energy why care who kives the shit um buse burning is going to endorse and you sure shit to want to be in a situation where you feel like you need to honor that when it happens, you need to have already put this in your mirror, you already need to put up the pay no mind sign so that when Bernie does endorse biden and they start banging on you to vote for them, you can just say, not my problem, look what they did to make this happen, look at the norms they violated, look at the lives they literally lost and killed, look at the people they literally killed to do this, it's it's it's an illegitimate process for. start to finish, not one that you're obligated to fucking acknowledge the results of in any way, so pay no mind, just forget about it, you don't have to care about the presidential election anymore, fill that hole with like scrimshaw or uh collecting jazz records or uh just doing more drugs, whatever, you don't have to care about the presidency anymore, so that's fun. uh and yeah, like Bernie, there's definitely versions of the Bernie campaign that would have been more fun to watch and participate in, but uh, I don't know if they would have been any more effective, because because a of the degree to which democratic uh voters are committed to the Democratic party, b, the degree to which non-voters are committed to not voting, and c, the degree to which um democratic party uh voters are uh hi are um in the thraw of mainstream media and the party itself, which they are, so that means like people say Bernie should have been harder on Biden and should have gone harder on Biden, well yeah, but that also would have been treated like all of his mild attacks on Biden were, as him trying to undermine the democrats on behalf of Trump, because for democratic voters things are all zero sum, things either benefit republicans or democrats and an attack on a democrat is something is... for republicans, that's just the way they think uh, so there's no guarantee that that would have worked uh, and and especially when the media was willing to take uh, to to give everything the benefit of Joe Biden spin on it as like the assumed thing to do, or is like the the actual reality, like they just were like, whatever the biden campaign spin on this is, is the one that we're giving primafasha uh uh credence to, and has the benefit has to do the uh, he has to uh match some burden of proof to get his point of view across. I mean, that's a fundamental difference in the way that they were treated by the media that was going to make it impossible for him to get enough of the uh democratic electorate who watched TV and believe that shit to follow along, unless they stayed uh uh separated, which they did until Obama made two phone calls and brought them all together, which is the together on. unprecedented intervention in the process that was done on the specific purpose to defeat one candidate, then you have what they did during this fucking primary and these these these these primaries that they from Iowa on, even before the coronavirus saying they've been illegitimate, but that the party still accepted them as as legitimate, all of these like five pulling places in Milwaaki during during a fucking pandemic, those delegates are going to get certified, what difference, I mean there was no way they were going to let it happen, period, end of sentence. Nobody else wants to do an emergency chapo today, they want to think some more, they want to get their thoughts fresh, uh, they want to get their thoughts like in order, but no, I just want to shoot off the hip, cuz what the fuck, yo, right, I just want to go off the hit as for like who too support in the in this thing like Howe Hawkins, that fucking PSL, I'm sorry, but third party politics are vanity bullshit, third party politics for at the presidential level is is a is for cranks, it's for cranks, I've said this before, but it's still fucking true, it's for cranks, third party presidential races are for, Bernie might not have been a crank because of his position, if he decided to run third party he could have been viable, but like these guys no one knows. Jo Stein, Gloria Lariva. It's crank bullshit. The point was you could have had Bernie on the top of a ticket in the two-party system, that would have been unprecedented and huge. As a third party, some dickhead, nobody knows. It's just, it's just a fucking passtime for people who ride recumbant bikes. So who gives the shit? vote forever you want. I'm not voting for Biden. I don't frankly I don't, I don't know if I'll ever respect anyone who does vote for Biden, honestly. Uh, so vote would but just as a personal thing of like you know how i wouldn't respect somebody who uh you know likes pineapples on pizza or something just like a thing that is personally repulsive to me uh uh uh so yeah voting for him is is a sign of a weak character i guess that's what i would say uh so do what you want uh i'll probably bite in bernie if you want to write in me that'd be funny if you could get like uh if you could get me like a percentage or no, like not a percentage, that's not realistic, but if you give me like a half a percent, or no, like a fraction of a percent, that'd be pretty funny, i don't know, whatever, doesn't matter, not our problem, not my problem, who care as the great dave, king dave said, big dave himself says who care, doesn't matter, that's a that's a yt, not an mp, so that's one thing you don't have to worry about. so the the task of the burny campaign though still has to be done, which is organizing people. the thing that's going to help that in this moment is that politics is about to stop being a spectator sport for the bourgeois and start be a thing that regular people have to content with every day in their lives, but man it really kill kills me to think like all right, so you're in the situation now where you have these uh where you have these wild cat labor actions to try to resist uh uh um you know literally having their lives put on the line by their their employers like at the Amazon warehouses and instacart where it's like you guys aren't giving us protection and we don't we're not making enough money to risk our fucking lives imagine how i mean right now like people are excited for it but like what has happened you know uh amazon fired one of the guys who was organizing their walkout in statton island uh and said that it was because he violated the social distancing rules which is just hilarious. uh and like it seems like a lot of them are not happening because people are fucking scared, well they should be because they know that they're fucked if they're know they were fucked if if it if it doesn't work and it probably won't work, imagine if people were in this situation, if people were at these vital bottlenecks for like the resources that we need to keep this fucking society from collapsing overnight into fucking road warrior uh had Bernie fucking Sanders as president, imagine what that would do to their their their leverage against their bosses, it's i mean that's if we didn't see mass nationalizations, which honestly I don't think are even out of the table off the table in a situation like this, and more importantly than that, you would have had millions and millions of people would voted for this, endorsed it, had some sort of investment in it success as a project, so that's what's really, that's what pains me is to think of what we could have had, and now yeah, we got people trying to exert leverage in a situation where if they get fired, they're going to be cast into a reserve army of labor that now what, numbers 30% of the population or soon will, It's tough, it's very difficult, which is why I see people saying, okay, Bernie's gone, time for the general strike, okay, Bernie's gone, it's like time, time for the revolution, it's like, if there weren't the numbers in America, in in in the in the fat, the fat, happy heart of the world empire, if you didn't have enough people willing to just go and vote for social democrat Bernie Sanders in this country, you really think you have the numbers to... fucking take up arms in a mass struggle or like simultaneously take their labor out of the fucking uh uh uh like out of the out of the economy you really think that that that the numbers exist to make that happen come on man come on man come on come on that's why the chief thing is the question like Bernie Bernie losing or whatever, it does not change the the central challenge, which is getting people, getting people on your side and beyond that, getting people willing to act, that's it, that's it, that's the only, that's the only thing. all other questions, strategies, tactics, they need to be subordinated to the question of that, what does that? annoys me right now is i don't fucking know, i know there's a lot of people with theories, i have not been convinced by any of them, doesn't mean any of them are wrong, does it just means that i don't really feel confident, i just know that that's got to be the goal, and i definitely know the presidential politics at this point are not going to get it done, without bernie there trying to get people to write in uh no get people to vote for. gloria relieva or get the fucking green party to 3% or something, that is just a waste of time, because you're not, you're not expanding anything there, you are pitching to the same gallery of disaffected cranks who always are looking for a third party to vote for, as opposed to the mass, mass, mass, mass of people who don't vote, only hope is there, the only hope is with the pralls, as Winston Smith said, means people say a third part a new party to disc plant the democrats, which of course is that's more promising than the idea of them competing with the democrats, it would have to be a complete overnight collapse like the wigs, the wigs are the model here, problem is is the wigs had specific historical context that made that happen, and that is the main one is the split that happened uh that destroyed the wigs was uh was regional, that when the wigs broke up over slavery, basically the entirety of the northern Wig electorate, everyone woted Wig in the north was already were all already pre-organized to to to uh join the party that would embody wig principles and be anti slavery and that was the republicans, in fact it was the emergence of the republicans and their success early in Fremont that made the wig collapse happen because people saw an alternative, but the thing was it was, it was self-organizing and instantly coherent along state lines. If you lived in a northern state and were a wig, you were probably anti-slavery because the democrats basically were the party of uh, the dough face party of collaboration with the southern slave power for the most part uh before the civil war, the the northern uh, if you were against slavery in the north. the democratic party was not really for you uh that's why there were like things like the liberty party and the uh and the free soil party and and then eventually the republicans was because of that non-existent democratic uh home for people who were in favor which meant that basically every wig in the north was ready to vote for the party that would basically be wigs minus slavery which was the republicans if this were to happen now the split is ideological uh and it's It's it's not as clean and it's not state-based, it's not like they instantly were able to take over not only half of the wig party but the but the part the half that was in states where they could run the table, which they did, that's not the same thing here, so whether it's party politics or not, I don't. no, what's another another thing that I uh that I don't uh, and the other, yeah, the other big difference is that if this, this split hap the split that happened to the wig party, you're not really, there's not really a conflict at the top there, because you're you're all capitalist, the question is whether you're a capitalist who think that we should accommodate slavery as a component of the supply chain, that's it, uh, this is would would be a a capitalist party uh, and like it's anti-capitalist wing breaking off. and that would make it the enemy of the entire establishment which did not exist with uh slavery of course. so all I can say is that right now I am a shruggy emoji guy on all questions of tactics, policy, what to do next? not the least of all, because we're in the middle of an unprecedented. pandemic and economic collapse, two things that have never happened, it's certainly never happened during an election year, i mean this is people say you've been living in interesting times, my god this 20th century, 21st century has been absurd, and specifically uh uh the last year, jesus like just Trump got in, it really has been someone put a sinder block on the fucking gas tank, gas pedal and now we're in totally uncharted territory, so that's another reason why I hesitate to say x, y or z is the next path forward, because we don't even know what the state of play is going to be in what even six months from now, six months, four months, two months, who knows? is there even going to be an election in 2020? that's a... open question to me that no one has really answered to my specifications, history is turning, wheel of history is turning, something's going to do something, something got to give, that's no, there's no question about that, but what, what that thing will be, is the thing i don't know, don't, don't ask me, i'm just a girl. Stacy said, honestly the most realistic left formation to emerge from the like from the American context. we have like imagining the different types of revolutions we have, left-wing revolutions we could have in this country, let's rank them byelihood of actually happening, i would say least likely uh the the the uh suck dem fantasy of a like electoral reform, because we know obviously before you get anywhere close to the the real engine house of power, the state comes in the apparatus, first and foremost the the capital. was class i mean uh for the intelligence community like the mafia version that could break the rules because even if you're winning by even if you're winning with within the rules they can always decide the rules don't exist with the help of institutions like the intelligence community so that makes that very unlikely uh it to just happen straight through honestly less not maybe a little more likely but still wildly unlikely is the idea of any kind of mowist like peasant war or or or ml like style uh bolschevic coup just wildly improbable to me given the conditions in this country. i mean we might be neopesants right? like i've said that the American like lumpin person in this country is basically uh is basically a medieval peasant within terms of their relationship to uh to each other and media and things like that like they are not they're not the the uh industrial subjects that marx imagined having a revolution uh but they don't. live like peasants, they don't live in on the land, they live disconnected completely from the land, that's why I said instead of potatoes in a sack, they're pringles in a tube, they've been processed, they've been chopped up, they've been fried, they've been put inside a carton, they're totally disconnected from their uh natural context, so therefore they can't fend for themselves, that makes them vulnerable, it makes them incapable of the type of action when we're talking about that a peasant like army could, like those landless hack. tribesman of southern um china made up the bulk of a of anti-uh imperial insurgencies all through China's history, we don't have those people, they don't, where are you going to go, you're going to go out, you're gonna you're gonna go camp out in like what the green belt behind your fucking uh subdivision, you know, you're going to take it, you're going to do a defense in depth of the fucking of the of uh of the house of yes in bushwick. so that's also unlikely, honestly, still very unlikely, but more likely than either of those, is some sort of middle level free officer coup within the military, like uh, like Egypt had with NASA, or like the carnatian revolution in Portugal, that's more likely than any of them, is is those those those icy troops, like some some mid-level radicalized officers, sort of like... off the head of the snake and uh and instituting some sort of like baracks socialism in in during of course during a moment of deep crisis, oh it wouldn't be a soft cou, I think a soft cou would be like just the suspension of like the forms of democratic government, which they honestly might do to Trump, I'm not. leading that out, they might like it's claimed that they might have already done Volsonaro, if they haven't done it to Trump yet, they might, and if they do, he would be very relieved honestly, you don't think Trump would... relieved at this moment, you don't think he's terrified at being president right now, you don't think that he would uh love the chance to not have this responsibility and have the military his beautiful soldiers, my beautiful soldiers, look at them, look at the had some generals, they want to take over, they're saying they can take a nap, they say they can go to, yes, Frederick Jamison has talked about how like the only model we have for any kind of social uh organism that like I talked about institutes a notion of a social self instead of a radically individualized. neoliberal self is the military, it's the only institution. now it's it it adds to that like fascistic shit and like it call to violence and death of worship and imperialism and all that stuff, but it also has the idea of like a speed acord and like of a collective uh project which don't which we do not have and which is one of the chief obstacles to trying to organize among people, because they don't think that way, i know i don't, i know i struggle to like build that notion. my head because it's just not something i'm built into so uh yeah man the free officers are there free officers do we got any free officers in the house are there any free officers you might want to uh consider like doing like a smedly butler type deal you know not the business plot but when he exposed the business plot he if he done like a counter business plot. sadly i don't really think so, honestly i think all the like anti- war like all the socialist troops are like podcasters, you know, like i think that's the high like the highest ranking anti like genuinely like socialist troop uh in in the army is probably yeah like a fucking uh lance corporal with like a podcast or something but who knows? Who the fuck knows? uh, I think they might be switching their love uh to nuusum from uh Kuomo, just because the fiction of Coomo being a doing such a great job is just becoming harder and harder to maintain in the face of uh the continued disastrous New York response and horrifying death rates uh, that's why it's like because it's like... they didn't pick kwomo because like they necessarily wanted him, they fucking put Kuomo there as a backstop as a last resort, as in case of in case of trouble break last situation, because he had a bion with the media, because people saw him as this decisive figure thanks to his press conferences, it was like they were looking for any port a storm and he was looking good, now though couple weeks later and the failure of New York to see the bend the curve bend at all uh he's not looking so good, meanwhile the curve does seem to be bending in in California and so Newsam's looking good and so now it's going to be him, he's going to be the backup, but that's just shows you it's like they have an overriding desire to have a backup to biden because they know he can't, he can't hack it, um, but like who it is specifically is contingent on public response and on facts on the ground, there's only so much that can be massaged, like you can take a uh like a... a genuine phenomenon like Two's press conferences that got people like feeling good, got people feeling like well reassured after watching the president just get sweaty and start freaking out uh and like like speaking in tongs. That was a real thing and so they they tried to hat grave onway, they tried to say, oh good, good, good, we got this, but then he just he get fucking up and he cut fucking insisting on cutting medicade while the bodies keep piling up, while it's still the... in the country, meanwhile you got another democrat across the country who is seems to have whatever maybe probably through luck more than anything has uh actually done thing although apparently there also like San Francisco took things very seriously unlike New York uh and that wasn't just kwoomo that was debunglaro uh let's not forget our own debungler uh debungled the fuck out of this thing he was telling people like two weeks after we knew for a fact that asymptomatic carriers could transmit it that if you were feeling weren't feeling sick you couldn't uh transmit it and so you should go out epic just oh one of our greatest bunglers one of our greatest bunglers honestly more of a bungler uh than um more of a bungler than bungler actually buse at least the o bungler got to be president for true terms fucking the bunglero got two terms as mayor and then the bungle the fuck out of a presidential ring Uh, the bungler, uh, do I see a place for propaganda of the deed in a postburning left? I'm not. Officer, I'm not sure if I want to commit right now to endorsing criminal acts in a public space or a recording that literally NSA could be watching right now uh I'm I'm uh no this is this is uh oh uh this uh uh I have a medical uh exemption uh I have to do this uh I've been prescribed this to have uh for having a podcasters hip. and this helps me, so please officer, I've just, I'm just going about my day, sir, please, please, sir, yeah, let's talk more about doing crimes and come on man, I don't know about propaganda of the deed, but I can tell you about propaganda of the weed, huh? what about sudden strikes seasing means? first of all, i love that as a tongue twister, sudden strikes seasing means, but how does that not beg the question of where do you get the people to do the sudden strikes? like once again, people are talking about tactical questions, and you're all assuming a can opener, the can opener you're assuming is a organized critical mass of radicals who are gonna all do the same thing at the same time, that is the can opener. that all questions of tactics assume and so I'm saying you can't assume the can opener and you have to start asking that question before you ask any others you ask how do we get people anybody any anybody asking any other questions has skipped a step and they're assuming a can opener what about sudden strike seasing means sudden strikes seasing means studen strike seas means sudding strike season neans the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog the arsenist has obly shaped feet you hear the work bell r and watch to the table, i'm drinking another spanish red, i'm enjoying the spanish reds lately, oh fine spanish, they're bold is the thing and they've got a nice mineral taste to them, i don't where this one's from, looks like it's a granasha tintarena mixture, it's good, Give you a reason to be happy at all, sir, that is beyond my pay grade, happiness comes from within, I cannot make one happy, I don't watch the little peop documentary now. uh, how big of a tool is David Axel Rod? His name is literally two tools, an axel and a rog, those are both tools, his name is two tools, how in the world did you know, happiness is right action, happiness is knowing that you're on the path of the beam, that's it, happiness is feeling a concord between your... bees and uh your spirits, I mean maybe yeah, maybe do some boofing, maybe boof, maybe boof it up, shine a light on me, special, don't know where virgil is, don't care. he submitted something for us to show put on the show and we didn't do it because it's like he's not talking to us so why would we do it so sorry i'm not going to bother with him how are we guys all of a sudden finding the fucking orson well's commercial that thing's classic but things that thing's been a remember that thing got referenced from the critic in 1994 how are you people all finding the shit out every two weeks i guess it's a new group of young people finding something i hate being reminded that there's a new group people young people, there's always a new group of young people every day, i hate it, zomer psychopaths, the republican party becoming the left party, no, that's idiotic. now the left party, the republicans will not be the left party uh, because then they wouldn't be the republicans, it's like a ship of theseus thing, like the the right, the right exists to... the the republican party exists to actually exercise power on behalf of capital, as opposed the democratic party which exists to provide a formal uh sort of ritual uh um the democratic party is there to perform like a ritual consecration of that action, like literally like manufacturer consent for what capital wants to do, that's why the democrats, so republican party literally is job is to function as capitalism's civil manifestation, how could it be the left party? regardless of what like people are trying to gamify with like Tucker Carlson or shit or like are intellectually talking about or trying to brand us whatever, what's going to change that function reality? maybe if you're in a situation where capitalism is so dire that like there has to be some sort of crisis uh uh um a crisis accomodation made with the people right and like it'll be like all right and it'll be like bismark it'll be like how bismark uh social welfare uh in in late 1800s Germany to forstall the socialists and say say they do that like even though this is an expression of the state it's like we're willing to live with this to for stall uh losing control of the power uh if that's the case uh it's going to happen regardless because it's going to be in capitalist interest to do it it's not going to be based on gamified shit and memes and and like people watching Tucker Carlson or like Josh Halley doing like a town hall meeting, it's going to happen because uh capitalism is in a dire enough crisis point that it may, the thing is is the reason I think it's meaningless is that if we get to the point of that deep of a crisis, I don't think capitalism is going to be interested enough in maintaining the the the need for the need for a a mask of consent to matter, it'll just rule directly, the whole mask will drop, and then that's what I'm talking about when I'm talking about like a direct milit. dictatorship or some sort of like civil uh some sort of like corporate like basically like amaz like the question is like will us military uh like nationalize amazon or does amazon buy the us military whichever way the mechanism goes the same result the result is the same profit extraction at the barrel of a gun by a corporate military dictatorship and that's going to be the that's going to be the uh the abolition of politics. and that means that all these like left right distinctions mean nothing, so that's why I don't think that's a thing. Singapore is a good example, yes, Singapore is a very good example, that's thank you, Singapore is perfect example, love the love the love the viewers. Real politics is going to start, that's the thing to be excited about, it's the thing to be scared of too, because nobody knows what to do, and we aren't as far along frankly as I thought we needed to be, that's just the fact, I thought the whole point of the burning thing was to get us on track to be in the best possible position for the crisis, that was what I really thought, being in the best with the best hand, when the best organization, the best mobilization to bet. the best control of institutions when the moment came, now the moment is here too early, but i don't think it's necessarily fatally too early, it's just it's it's it's just the it's just a simple fact that it's not as far along as i would have liked or thought necessary, that's it, but i don't know, i was just guessing, we're all just fucking guessing man, none of us know, nobody knows shit, nobody knows shit. nobody knows a fucking shit about shit, it's nut, uh, it's nuts, my skepticism about uh mutual aid is that it has to scale up and i don't know how it does, scaling up is the key, because it's like people say, well we can use mutual aid to get a critical mass of people, but you're still talking about uncoordinated activity by people spontaneously and hoping it accumulates to something and that hasn't worked in this country, i don't know where it has, honestly, but it sure shit hasn't worked here. You guys know that Mondragon was established under franco right? It's hard to imagine that it could be a real threat to capitalism or an alternative to it if it was allowed to exist under Franco, but no, my good news for the day is guys, you don't have to worry about presidential politics anymore, that's my takeaway, you got to have a takeaway of his day, feeling bad, feeling owned, feel and honestly more than anything don't you feel owned, don't you feel like all those globe emoji dip shits and and fucking frauds and and and and hacks and idiots and concern trolls, don't you hate that they're fucking like gloating right now and that they're posting memes at you, they're posting the gonna dancing funeral guy meme memes at you, they're doing it, you know they're doing it right now, we're all taking a break from having the goddamn gonna meme guy given to us by fucking globe emojis and never burny housewives. It's happening and that sucks, but at least you don't have to care from now on, and you can watch the amazing, amazing, transcendently great, I really hope we get them, I the main thing I reason I want there to be an election in November is because I want there to be debates, I need debates and I want a bunch of debates and I don't want just want three debates and I want, I want them all to be different, I want like five or six debates and they all have to have different like obstacles like in the five obstructions, like there'd be a debate where um uh where they get all... their medication taken from them and they can't take their medication for the 24 hours before, then they do one where they get double the regular medication uh they do one uh fuck it they do one like standing in a pool of water uh and of course we would need a sons debate instead of the VP debate obviously and that would be so much fun and you know what I mean I watched those debates with Bernie with my heart my chest screaming thundering I'm going to take Chinese research chemicals and like fucking I'm going to take. acid and fucking ndma and fucking uh going to like invent a new way to get high off of fucking air conditioning free on and i'm going to watch those debates and just make my brain turn like get peel it like a potato and just let the raw fucking nerves just allow biden versus trump to overlay onto my sizzling fucking cortex oh one where they swap medications that's great see you guys are coming up with great what is too? love, we're we're collaborating right now guys, i love it, oh i love you guys, oh yeah, we will definitely be streaming those debates, those i i honestly will break quarantine, if it's we're still in quarantine and we're not dead uh, i will break quarantine to go with my homies and watch those debates while my brain is just being annihilated by high high level hallucinations in large dosage. yeah, i'll take the hydrochlorine shit. i know, i want hunter versus Eric and Don Jr. they should be able to tag team and they'll still both get annihilated. i want it, because that's the perfect way to just show how superior he is to them, is that he he's better that he could beat both of them with one hand. time behind his back and the other hand smoking crack. what would i say if matter glacius was here? uh, oh boy, redacted, redacted parody, parody, redacted parody. uh, the one thing i like about matter glacius and this is an honest fact is that i obviously have a a deep strong, powerful hatred in my heart for very many people. people in DC, specifically the media class scumbags, most specifically the media class scumbags i grew up watching and like observing from the sidelines during the blog era um like kleine, iglesius, these guys, this is these little craven little worms who just went from uh supporting the Iraq war to um to just becoming these just hollow men, these hollow stuffed men. uh and so I abused them all a lot on the internet uh but the th like josh barrow guys like that but the thing is I don't know to what degree they care like like like Josh Barrow blocks me and so... "i know he's seen me, but like I don't know what his attitude is, like Eli lake, of course, obviously people make fun of him because of his way he's like, oh, the trolls, lol, oh, you guys, I love your passion, oh, I love your passion, uh, and you can kind of like be like, oh, I bet you really are annoyed by this, but honestly I don't know if he is, I don't like actually cares, he might, he might honestly think it's all funny, because he's one of these guys who just doesn't give a shit about anything, but Aglacius really, really values his own uh, sense of his intelligence and uh, his liberal credentials." uh and he uh like he really does believe in this shit about himself and that's why I know uh that that he has seen everything I've ever said about him and that he hates me uh and that makes me feel good. I'm glad he hates me. I'm glad ilicit that feeling from him and I know he can say it's not true but I'll never believe him. I mean maybe that's difference doesn't matter then but honestly I just I'm a little bit and so I have kind of a i have sort of a phone. for him just by virtual of the fact that i know i got to him from hell's heart i stab at thee for hate sake i spit my last breath at thee uh some guy there's this guy uh on twitter who just started a new account and i think it's called iglacius takes uh and this guy is going around and he's finding old uh tweets that people have done about iglesius like jokes at his expense and stuff like that uh and so he's been like retweeting a bunch of my old uh tweets about him that i totally forgotten about um and i just wanted to read some buse uh buse they're pretty good i'm not gonna lie uh i think uh let me check here man, i do have not a lot of these are that good, i'm still looking for the good ones, uh, i guess this is. uh, this was one I did in like 2015 that I thought was just very, it wasn't really a joke, it's just an observation that is 100% true. Matt eglacius is haunted by the knowledge that there are one 100,000 wonkish Ivy grads with his exact voice and skill set, and that I think is the reason that he has got a chip on his shoulder and and so hostile is because he is aware of the fact that he is a fucking uh, that he's a fucking mediocrity and that he's 100% a case of uh nepotism, his dad uh went to Harvard and then he went to Harvard, it's that simple, like that's that explains 99% of his assent, and he knows it, and it haunts him, that he's interchangeable, that he's literally another just another egg bitch in Washington. uh, for Christmas, Matlacius got his maid a coupon book, good for hundreds of dollars of savings at her favorite local restaurants, i forgot about that one, i thought that was pretty good, uh, somewhere in suburban virginia matterglacius is browbeating an applebeas waitress into accepting an expired chiles. i like that one time i went absolutely ham on him and uh and borrow because they were joking about how brown was a lesser ivy because they both went to Harvard but both of them were legacies and fact uh uh barrow's dad was like in the harvard uh uh economics department when he was going there like like 1 million percent nepitism cases and these guys are chordling about how brown is lesser ivy and i just lost it's like you are such snivling scumbags you little fucking manner born habsberg fucking twats if you were like 19th century spanyards you'd be hunting peasants for sport and that would be more fucking honest than whatever this troly like civil society shit is given how much you deeply can have contempt for people who you have absolutely no superiority to, because if the fucking if if actual work was and value like was the... right, like your if your monetary uh, your job related to your competence, you'd be fucking folding shirts at the gap if you were fucking lucky, like you were interchangeable cog, and uh, and uh, barecked me for that and has not unblocked me sense, iglacius black me for a little bit, but then i think people made fun of him for it and like said, hey, what the hell, don't you like you know ideas and then like as a show of generosity, he unblock me, which i love because it means he's seen it, he's seen it everyday. ever said about it uh one of them i really like was this is based on that movie the box with camer diaz have anyone seen and it's a guy oh shit i'm almost not all right all right well i guess making fun of aglacius will be the end of this uh but the last joke was the guy from that movie the box goes to aglacius press this button and he will get a million dollars but someone somewhere that you don't know will die and then and he just presses the button and he goes, wow that was really fast, i thought that was good. all right guys, i got to go, time the clock is up, so listen to what i if you, i hope if you listen to this, you feel a little better about a bad day uh and ready to do whatever needs to be done as the conditions change and as uh as we realize what's happening around us and and resolve to do what's necessary. to uh liberate the human race from its shackles of oppression, let's do it, let's get that bread guys, let's get that bread, bye-bye.
