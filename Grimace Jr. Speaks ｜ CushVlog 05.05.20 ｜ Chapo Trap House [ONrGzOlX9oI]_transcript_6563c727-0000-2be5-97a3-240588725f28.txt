 soy facing like a boss, hi guys, here we go, there we are, there are the faces, smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes, they don't tell the truth, smiling faces, smiling vases some downs, hi guys, ah ah so don't really have anything planned for today don't have any graphs don't worry about that just uh just having a chill uh wind day hanging out what are you guys uh what's the what is going on? i haven't really been online uh what's been the big news other than the hilarious mercenary mishaps of our uh of our friends in the deep state goof the goofam ups that everyone's having down in Venezuela with the uh the danning bride characters or tried to grab Nicholas Maduro with a cartoon butterfly net. We're gonna do a crossover with the Q and on guys next week. Uh, the queue and anonymous podcast, not, not the uh, not the patriots to decode the proofs. has there been a queue proof in a while? it seems like the whole um... It's kind of funny because you think that the that the uh um the COVID-19 thing would really go to their benefit, they'd be like, oh great, we can you know this is this is it, but they have the problem that one, you know, I'm not sure how much uh queue talked about in any kind of legible way they're being you know um uh He didn't really talk about those things he didn't talk about um there being a bunch a virus or anything so it's like hey if if is so smart what the fuck uh and then there's the fact that even though Trump's president you'd think a time like a massive uh massive uh illness outbreak like this would be perfect opportunity to round up the siccos and they're not doing it, they're not rounding up the siccos, so they must be very confused, so I'm I'm looking forward to talking to those guys about what the latest uh, what the latest uh attempts at parsing reality are from those people? uh, I think that for epine stuff, I think for anything, any of the fun conspiracy stuff, uh, you should treat conspiracy shit. the way that you treat uh like one of your favorite food indulgences, you know, you shouldn't give up things that you really enjoy to eat, but you should eat them in moderation and certainly as part of a balanced diet, that's you can apply that to media in all ways, but you can certainly apply it to the way that you construct like political reality in your head, and the great thing about conspiracy stuff is that it's just even if it's not true, it's the shadow of what's really happened, you know, like uh, nothing that uh oliver stone says about the the the military. complex taking over the government after the Kennedy assassination is wrong, it's just a question of whether or not Kennedy was actually killed by them. um, same thing with CIA mind control, i mean what do the hell do you call this massive digital infrastructure that controls every element of our uh of our like symbolic language uh and which is basically at the beck and call only of corporate titans and uh the deep state intelligence agencies, how isn't that just how isn't the fucking how do you not think of the internet as just like a giant uh ml mk ultra experiment, you know, and it's like none of that has to be literally true, but if you recognize the contours, you can apply them to your real life and it makes you realize things like, oh, this is not a democracy, oh, these institutions are not legitimized by who is who votes for who, you get that truth, and the let the like the lighter you hold and the less you indulge in like your conspiracy stuff needing to be technically true. the more it can help you contextualize information and new things that happen to you, but like the the cranks, the conspiracy cranks are the people who insist, no, no, no, this isn't just something we can speculate about. This is something that we can, not only can the uh, we know exactly what happened, but I am the one who actually knows what happened, and those people uh have become too brittle in their thinking to accommodate anything else, like take a guy like grover fur, anybody know grover fur, grover fur is the king of the uh stalin apologists uh, apologist um academic tradition, he he's he's he's a university of New Jersey and he writes these books about how the entire secret speech was a lie that everybody who died in the um in uh the great purges was killed by yezov uh without stalin knowing it and um uh that the ukrainian famines basically didn't happen or were we're grossly exaggerated uh and to the extent that they killed people stalin didn't know about it now of course he's trying to do that to justify Stalin right like he's trying to get people to think Stalin was a good guy. but he's acknowledging that all this bad stuff happened, well if Stalin was a good leader and a good good guy to guide the uh the the great ship of state uh the great Helmsman, why the hell was all that bad shit happening? like how how and it starts from, but the thing is he starts from a good premise, he starts from the premise of I'm going to defend Stalin against the the uh, the Robert Service, Robert Conquest, Neol Khan Slander of the Soviet Union and the entire uh uh Bolshevic. project and you should, and Stalin needs to be contextualized. I mean, my god, I would start by pointing out, you want to cry for the Holadormo, how about the fact that the fat piece of shit who is uh, supposed to be like the epic Win Bacon member of the big three, Winston Churchill, have allowed 3 million people to die in Bengal of starvation and yucked it up the entire time, I mean contextualize it, that's where you like tried to uh extract the truth and like remove the sting of the slander, but Grover got so fixed. on the question of Stalin's personal virtue as if that matters that he just like rearranged his entire project to not not even be about that anymore because he he didn't buse he wasn't he didn't hold the truth loosely enough is in his hand and that's the same thing with conspiracy stuff so like yeah i believe the epstein stuff represents some degree of a real network of real rich pedophiles who really ritually abuse children where they do it how often? they do it, which ones do it? I don't know, and neither does anybody else who speculates, you can build up like you, the the artifice of your uh, of your uh, instinctive faith in it through the accumulation of like meaningful details, I mean epsteen is really the gift that keeps on giving in that respect, it's it's he's been dead for almost what a year, almost a year now and or or nine months and uh there's still stuff happening that's that's spilling out about his insane connections to every element of the... of the of uh of the of the uh what, you got the deep state, you've got Silicon Valley, uh, you've got the uh, the NGO Para governments of the gates, that's also tied in with the coronavirus fac seed, it's it's just a rich onion and worth up, but like the whole time, you don't have to, you don't have to fucking say no, because if it's not true i'm wasting my time, it's only wasting your time if it matters whether it's true or not, and then since you're trying to build an ideology and not, not like you're not serving a jury, just kind of let it hang and just find what really is convincing, so you can let the stuff that you believe because of motivated reasoning fall away, because then you're not convincing yourself, it's true all the time to fill in the gaps of your uh, of your information, how would you start a mercenary company? that's a good question, i i should probably get one, sounds like it be fun. Huh, that's funny, Rohava is a model for uh, post American Falcanization, I mean that is obviously one of the better case scenarios if that were to happen, um, I was thinking about the the whole like coalecing doomer wave now, as we really look into the face that the government and the and and corporations are and the state. is willing to just normalize 9/11 every day to maintain a market economy and not even like to get to permanently overthrow it and have themselves executed. no, they could still manage the transition, they're just too incompetent and too brittle in their uh power to risk letting that happen, letting it out of their, letting letting it show be shown to people for even what a year that you could manage the economy without market signals, so they're going to just... just let everyone die, they're going to thandos snap everybody, because that's the thandos snap, thandos is the ultimate neoliberal, because he's got the thando's glove and he could do anything, but he's is so conditioned by neoliberalism that it's like, yeah, no, there's too many people, not enough resources, got to kill them all, when you could rish for any number of changes to the material circumstances that would make it more uh more harmonious for people to live together, and that's what we're not, that's where we all are, i mean they weren't fucking around with the there is no alternative uh, and like we're looking, honestly what we're looking at more than anything, is is at the fucking enormity of our powerlessness. in the face of this, that's really what is freaking people out, it's just how fucking powerless people are, and how we're going to let it happen, and we're going to end up blaming each other, we're going to end up feeling guilty and going to be mad at others to some degree and going to put almost none of that energy towards like resting power from these draculas and that's not any of our faults, because coronavirus is like just breathtingly symbolic creature, i mean not it comes out. it attacks this system, this lake capitalist system and it basically replicates every uh uh fault line, it it it presses on every fault line to push things in a bad direction, so like at the material level it comes to an economy, the United States that's first of all runed by a corrupt caball of of uh of incompetent criminals and I'm not even talking about the Trump administration, I'm talking about the the permanent bureaucracy and the basically semi-permanent party uh operatics to make up. both hard parties of congress, both both sides of the isle obviously all the way through all three branches of government just topped with a little cherry of the ridiculous orange cheeto man uh so you have that and then you have on top of that a fucking uh a a gig-based fucking economy of people working uh uh like people working tenuous precarious service industry jobs uh to to just make up for the deficit in in or make up for the... need for consumption that Americans are required for the by the rest of the world uh to be as the consumer of last resort, we got to keep eating uh, it piles up too much, the economy falls apart, keep eating, hogs, keep eating, uh, well, boom, now at the at the material level, you can't get service, you can't go out, you can't go to the to the uh, uncle Pete's pot, trop slot, slap troth, rather, uh, you can't. go down to uh going out to the pizza gorge and of course that just makes people who are wildly alienated and basically get only their almost all of their pleasure in life from direct physical sensation of fat carbohydrates uh and alcohol that that's not a good combination and they have to stay home and the economy has a huge demand cycle and they say great this is the material conditions that should lead to a revolution right like that was the hopeful that was the hopeful pill when the... started, people aren't going to put up for that, but look at what the effect of the disease is, just as it affects the material conditions long its weaakest fault line, which is the fact that it's a service economy, it attacks our political culture at its weakest fault line, which is that it's wildly atomized, like one of the big reasons that Bernie failed is because the citizens do not uh have the uh motor connection between uh uh people who are have enough free time. in the communication flow to even hear that's hear that or like at the level and have the level of like good faith investment in strangers on the internet or the government to invest anymore any of their will towards it and now we're literally in a situation where we've created a fucking cast. of people who are too busy running around, I e too materially alienated, too uh, labor alienated, too busy running around uh, risking their life to survive, and everybody else stuck in their houses like uh veel caves to with uh with with this vast amount of alienated um lesure time and it's they're literally pressed against like out from each other, they're socially polarized. by the actual uh, by the viral, the the the effect, the virological effect of corona, and so now you've got two forces pushing the economy into greater uh distress, but also pushing the ability to fight back against it uh, is dissipated by the pressure against people physically from even being able to talk to one another. because as we've discussed, internet isn't going to do it, we've discussed, that's done, it has to move to the real world, and just as the real world reasserts itself, everybody is literally. behind their doors and unable to talk to each other and more and more and more invested in symbols, i mean my god, they're now making like snl saturday night live a fucking so a zoom show, do you think that's going back? it's not going all the way back, none of this is going all the way back uh, so that's why there's a lot of room for despair, but like something's going to shift, something's going to shift, there's going to be a big shift happening here uh in the coming years and the thing is because everything is so brittle and because our political system in particular so brittle and because we spend so much time of our emotional investment uh in politics around those symbols that are most fragile like the United States and all that as a concept uh we forget that there's another representation uh of like the fragility of America and it's the size of its economy like the... size of the American economy, and the simple fact is that even with corona and even with uh thousands dead, even with the huge demand shortfall, even with great depression too, with just pure neoliberalism, there is a, there's like an intropic rate that that economy can like lose power, unless there's some massive intervention like the like the coronavirus tr to the black plague or you know we get nuked or something to destroy a bunch of capital instantly, the capital has to go... there go out into the rest of the world at a certain rate, so America's decline from this point is clearly and obviously uh, it's not even a question of whether it's going to happen, we're in the decline phase, we are on we are on one of those plinko board zigzaggy decline phases, you know, and um, the thing is, this is going to bring another decline phase, but at any one of those, the conditions can shift enough, then all of a sudden there's political friction again and you can do something, so the assumption that because everything looks so brittle now uh, even with even with bad things happening that those bad things have to be the end, that those bad things mean there's no way to arrest decay, uh, that is incorrect also, and of course it's a liberal excuse to disengage from politics completely and uh, let the world go to hell while you, uh drown yourselves and luxuries, Adam Curtis a few years ago described how any compelling vision of for a new world would require somebody something that can marry subjective mystery and scientific reality back together again, agree, disagree, wow, you know, the funny thing is is I would have read, I would, I didn't see that movie. uh, I'm not sure which one that is, uh, but um, yeah, no, the pandemic is going to be just the same, only worse, but the thing is is that the worse is going to cause a new alignment that might bring out a different crisis and that's the thing, uh, you got to, you got to remember because like there still has to be a function that makes the worse happen, and that is like, you know, the the punctuation, uh, oh, he was interviewing russel brand, um, I would have read that a few years. ago and I would have been like, that's absolutely true, but then I would have just been like, yeah, but how, and then I would have been like, yeah, well, somebody better figure that out, oh well, uh, I'm off to epically own Ross Dout it, but uh, now I'm like, oh god, yeah, of course, that's literally what I've been thinking through this whole time, but the problem is is that at that level of abstraction there's nothing to do about it, so you end up being paralyzed, you have to start from the grill, you have to start from from the... table in front of you and deciding what you're going to put on it, but the thing is is that you say you need to put, and this is the problem, like you got trad castle say yeah, you need to put religion back into the material world, but the way they want to do that is they want to take the material reality of like the the brittle and disgusting uh institution of the catholic church and just bash people over the head with it, well that's not going to work, that you're just going to you're just going to end up like being another arm of... disciplinary capitalism uh, they're just going to sell rosaries instead of flashlights, it's just it's not, it doesn't change anything because people's relationship to the religion hasn't changed uh organically, which can only occur over time when they have an opportunity, when people have an opportunity to reflect, the only thing when we're this alienated uh materially uh globally and how and and is is going to be to reduce material alienation, so nobody's going to be able to go back to... church and uh have kids again like these tradcasts want if the fucking boot isn't taken off the neck of people in this country and around the world and then then you can have like a a genuine piety and sense. of uh of purpose and social cohesion emerge, but that means you someone has to move first, and the person has to move first is the person who has to has the foot on the neck, and that is, I'm sorry, it's not, it's not the the happy uh, it's not the happy merchant, it's not uh, it's not Hollywood degeneracy, it's not cultural marxists, which is all just begging the question, it's capitalism along that axis of who is making it harder for people to be spiritual, it is capitalism, so any of these trad cats who want to marry anything to the idea that no, we can do this through markets uh or through basically through supporting market politics uh and and advancing market politics uh is absurdly wrong so it's like a spirit all spiritual problems have a material base and vice versa and the spiritual problem is spiritual emptiness the uh the solution is material is reduction of material alienation and spiritual alienation and will measure and but the question's like well that's both things yeah but who but where is the plane? the plane is material so you start with material so anybody is tradcating on the internet is just larping along with every other tanky with the fucking uh stolen avatar or anybody else they're all just planning pretend none of them really believe in that because they're not acting in a way that would bring it about they're acting in a way that perpetuate and suspend if it were, like this is where the cat comes in, i hate to say this, but if everyone reacted that way, if everybody decided to fight for traditional catholicism online or bring back the Soviet Union online, uh, guess what, it would, and and their practice for doing that was fighting on the computer over it, like if everybody had your beliefs, but their beliefs were fighting over the computer about it, guess what, you'd still live in neoliberal hell, think about that, everybody who's like a political practice is yelling at other people on the computer to their identity, if everyone did that, not everyone believed what you believed, but everybody believed what you believed and acted on it in the same way, like if they were just snapped into a place, it's the same world as ours, so it's not like the material conditions have changed, but now everyone believes that you believe, everyone's a trad cath, congratulations, but they also have your ingraine need to establish trad cathary through the internet or through or ' epic uh uh mous third worraldism or anything, and guess what, neoliberalism that you snap back into would persist, it would change a little bit, but it would be around the edges. see, I don't, I don't understand how that's supposed to say be disagreement. suicide rates decreased during times of war because people felt their suffering served a greater purpose. Exactly, they were less spiritually alienated. but because they were more materially invested, they're suffering, work is not labor is not necessarily spirit deadening, dead labor is spirit deadening, dead labor, with you're fighting, if you're fighting a war that you believe in or believe in to the extent that you want to see your family live through, That's because you believe what you're doing, and so even if you are in material hardship, your degree of alienation is less, so yeah, but that's the same process and it's generated at the material level, I got all, I got all peppery there guys, I'm sorry, I'm trying to yell. less in general, i'm trying to like, i'm trying to let things flow through me, but i'm a little, i'm a little off kilter today for a few reasons, sorry, hoping to get back onto the uh, onto the escot mount, is meoliberalism still a useful term of what we're going to see following the pandemic as a retrashment or globalism uh from globalism towards protectionism and uh yeah it'll just be the the plan will be different uh like neoliberalism doesn't treat everybody the same obviously ask anyone from a fucking uh you know an African country uh or India the global south ask anybody who got killed in the Bangladeshi fucking uh sweatshop uh that uh matterglacius uh defended doesn't the uh it doesn't under these conditions it does doesn't treat anybody everybody well now it pretends to, but these and uh but it doesn't actually uh and so if if if the global market breaks into regional markets that are... able to connect to each other anymore because of some sort of massive breakdown, if if if global warming and the pandemic have that degree of dissolution of a of structural uh legitimacy, then that's just going to reproduce itself in that group, which is why uh the white nationalists are idiots, if you still have capitalism as the driver of your economy, you're just going to find a new group of people, look at what john Cornon did in Texas, this guy, he tells everybody uh, he says, if you're a fucking uh, if you're fat or you have a heart attack and you die of covid, you didn't really die of COVID, you died of your own sinful behaviors, but he's referring to his own texas constituence because a greater threat to profit exists, that same phenomenon is going to exist in your white havens, so neoliberalism is still going to be the or at that point it's just capitalism, because neoliberalism, the the neoliberal um element of that is the is the dream of it becoming global, like the globe really is the symbol of neoliberalism. because that is the dream is is yes markets obviously like it's always been yes markets obviously since the beginning of of uh of history but yes markets obviously given these restraints yes markets obviously but like all these things camesianism whatever it's all yes markets obviously but what about the real world we live in neoliberalism next no no markets we have the whole world see the globe so if that broke up you would just have smaller sub-units, since they were aware that other places still existed, it couldn't be neoliberalism anymore, because those places are you know contributing in some way uh because they'd be interacting presumably, to undermine like the establishment of a market, so like neoliberalism is a totalized state or a dream of a totalized state uh that wouldn't persist in like some fractured thing, but the per but uh the logic, the extractive logic of that hyper cap hyper develop state of capitalism where it's been honed to a fucking hanzo steel edge that cuts through everything uh that's going to uh still be there and it's going to cut up every one of these traditionalist societies it's going to chop up all those uh Hungarians who think that uh Orban has their best interest at heart uh it's going to chop up all the brexit all the all the gamins all the brexit gamins if they fall out of the purview of capitalism as it emerges if they are not needed um as consumers, and then they'll just find a new axis of of uh of of back back justified uh differentiation to justify why they deserved it. see that's the problem is that like obviously the end state of communism is is global communism as it has to be, i mean if neoliberalism is the dream is the nightmare. of a globe reduced by markets to destruction uh and desiccation, the the the the dream is a totalized communal state that harmonizes flow of resources and protects the uh the homeostasis between uh species and and humans and and the natural world natural world. and right now the one where it breaks down and shatters down into smaller and smaller units until we establish we go basically we went from it's like a ride on a uh it's like the the American Eagle at uh at six flags it's like early early slave uh agricultural empires uh feudalism capitalism crisis point cri crisis for of profit, the need for profit in the system is essentially the point where the need for profit in the system of capitalism collapses against the degree of entropy in that system i, the exhaustion of resources, the alienation of of of human spirit and and uh and material you know condition, and when that happens, what has happened in the past? the next stage, hypothetically, the one we're all hoping for, is is a move towards the capitalism, now or towards some sort of socialism, now that that flow is, if that if the if the momentum in the direction up is insufficient, it's going to fall back down and it's not going to go into something we don't recognize, it's going to be a new version of feudalism, a synthesized techno feudalism that has uh the social characteristics of feudalism, but now with the uh the... economic efficiency and symbolic efficiency and material deadness frankly of uh of capitalism, which is essentially the worst possible state, you can't... think of a worse state than this, because you've got a situation where people are as cowed and and uh confused and unable to organize effectively against power as they are in as they uh more than they ever were under capitalism when it became hegemonic at the mercy of a uh of a governing ideology that has at its disposal uh a a a refined version of the ho and the and the mount and bailey castle that is purely digital, purely synthetic, operated at the press of a button and essentially guarantees that human conditions will be at that point reduced down to the status of slavery again, slave empires, which this is see by the way, that is the singularity that the fucking dope ass uh uh uh like acceleration is nickland types that's what they're praying for uh basically they're they're betting that that's not just one result, but the inevitable result, and so they're basically coping with that, like that's what Nick Land shit is, it's the ultimate like fake cope, it's like, yeah, sure, we're all going to be one with the demonic uh uh uh robot lizard god, but that's cool, that's fine, I like it, actually, but obviously that's absurd ridiculousness because we're too early in the process, way too early in the process to say, oh yeah, no, no, this is the moment when it turns. there are so many different variables because so many different things can happen and there's so many different directions that that developmental curve can take uh that yeah it's just at the end of the day the failure of imagination it's a failure of having the spiritual will to pursue the question to its fullest extent at which point you realize any any non-communist teleological approach. your term, not the idea that it's going to happen in your lifetime, that's absurd, but it is a potential end state for human existence, and if Nick Land, nickland by saying no, it's going to be the tech hell uh uh singularity, well I'm sorry dude, then there is a potential, if there's a potential tech singularity for the to the exact same extent, there is a potential tech heaven singularity, sorry, there is, and you might say, oh, not really. at the level of abstraction we're talking about, how many thousand like what hundreds of years? i know the timeline is going to be much faster than it got to get here because we've compounded time into these uh technological innovations that like basically concentrate time into a weapon like that's what technology often is um but even with with hundreds of years the idea that no we're in the world where this all falls apart uh it's cope you're giving up you're giving up you're giving up on the problem and uh and why? because you triggered the libs, you gave up on the problem, the real riger of this problem uh, because it was more fun to trigger the libs online, isn't that it nick? and that's why they made the wrong call, that's why all these guys went the wrong code, because they were too invested in mechanical truth to see the push and pull between spirit and matter. oh boy, i'm getting over the top here, never mind, but yes, so that's that's me saying uh, no doom. pill uh, because you're always in a contingent moment of history, buse everybody else, look at look back at all history and you will find the contingency in it at some level, and you just have to know where you where that is for you to put your shoulder against the wheel, because you're why are you triggering the libs? because you cannot get full satisfaction from a moment of uh of of of labor of of pressing against something, of actually getting friction, you prefer the fake steril friction of going on the internet, uh, actually there is no, somebody ask what's the difference between grill pill and cleaning your room, there isn't, it's i'm a tertempting to this is essentially going to uh be provide some i hope. for some people this is providing like a uh a a uh a challenge, a dialectical challenge to the peters and stuff, which we didn't do last time, i'll admit it because i wasn't thinking that way. uh, I was just thinking of his greater threat because everyone's beliefs were so brittle on the internet, it's like, oh no, uh, the the the the the essential insight that Jordan Peterson had was that you can't tell someone to do something, they have to want to do it themselves, that's it, and that's and and the way you the only way to prove that to someone is to ask them to do something small and then see it develop in their own life, and so they convinced themselves and it wasn't you, that's the central insight of... clean your room and nobody talked about it like that because to give him any credit was to say that yes actually women are chaos lizards who need to be kept in cages or whatever the fuck um but the reality is is that if you don't start from that you are fucked and like I guarantee you 99% and the thing is is that mine's better mine's better because I i guarantee you the majority of those fucking uh um clean your room guys they ended up just as miserable if not more so, because what was Jordan Peters, Peterson's ultimate explanation for their misery? it wasn't that they live in misery because they're incarnated flesh and that their beauty in life is to reduce the amount of suffering in the world. no, it's that there's a demonic cabal of of marxist college professors telling girls that they shouldn't date them. no amount of cleaning your room is going to get you to a point where you can't uh satisfactorily press against that truth, unless you fill a - gym bag with techns and go to a fucking college campus, because it's abstract, because it's because it's faulty, it's just a faulty thing, and because it's faulty, what do they end up doing, if they don't grab a gun and go shoot people, they go and try to take down those marxist professors online, because jordan peterson. have only told them one part one poll of this wiggling truth nugget thing that you're trying to grip together, he was saying, he was saying, yes, you need to be self-motivated, but you need to be self-motivated to go on the computer and tell these fucking feminists to shut up and to tell them to read my book, boom, you're right back on the computer and everything i've talked about about reaffing all the shit, banging your head against the wall, seeing your degree of investment in any level dissipate. and be replaced with nothing, but I'm saying we live in, we live, we are bound, we are bound materially, we are bound materially, and that means that we can only act materially, and that's why clean your room even though it starts from the same premise as a grill pill, is fraudulent, and mine, like I said, you can find out for yourself, I'm not trying to tell anybody anything other than if they want to be less miserable. try to find something that they can do in their lives. yeah, dbt is a part of it for sure. whatever like thing in your head that can act as a uh as a bridge to legibility is something that you should incorporate. i mean, i'm not gonna judge, i don't care. yeah, a current affair, yeah, the the Mcrim guy. I mean that guy really should have made caused people to be more introspective, you know, because I mean either way that's disturbing right, like if you're not going to think about it too much, you're still gonna have to wonder how many of my fellow rozamosi comrades are just like on the edge of some sort of snap, some sort of break, uh, how can I trust their owns, how can I trust their uh their cool uh, how can I trust that their memes aren't counterfit uh or at least to think like damn? doing all that posting online really did not help this guy at all develop better political opinions because usually uh your politics should not include shooting up a bunch of people at a bar including your your uh sister for godsakes or no I'm sorry I'm sorry I think uh this trans uh brother I'm not sure. uh, you're forget, you got to assume all these uh, I'm sorry, someone asked a question about uh, the thing about uh energy and resources, you have to imagine at some point that all systems are closed. and that even that includes economic systems and at this point you can assume that the economic system is closed, as for now the economic system is a closed system, except for like... photosynthesis you know at that level of like of like the sun energy being brought brought in and like the the uh the uh magnetic poles, it's a closed system, it's a global economic system for the i mean the exceptions are negligible enough to be uh essentially friction, i might end up living in the woods, i have no idea, the thing is is that you can't really plan too far ahead and that's scary at times like this when everything feels so liquid and if it's like it doesn't change things, you planning and fretting about a future that you can't directly trying to bring about will not change the urgency of your feelings about it, you have to channel them productively right because you got to remember it's like yeah we still have photosynthesis and and uh and uh and sun coming in, but we also have greenhouse gases literally cutting off and and and uh like reflecting the heat back, so it's like unless we are able, I mean unless somebody wants to to uh replace the carbon economy with like a wildly more efficient solar energy uh grab, we're going to have a crisis point because because consumption just isn't going down, because consumption is how authority is maintained in the west, yeah, see everyone's offering me just and uh uh, everyone saying I'm wrong, it's like, yeah, people, I am wrong because I don't know that much about science, you can check, I don't know, but I just know that that is, that is the mental picture to help you bring down to size of... like the economy, the specifics of it, i don't know, because i'm not a science man, and people are and any any objection anybody wants to talk about, i that's a category because you see the way that systems rise and fall and collapse, they are all mirrors of each other, oh boy, i'm getting crazy, never mind, getting two in the weeds, uh, delete all of this, i got to stop looking at the, i got to stop looking at the thing, i get the chat. I get distracted, but the thing is the problem with de-growth, people say we need to degrowth, well what is the political violence of that? you got to get people on your side to have less of a consumer experience, when the consumer experience is the whole total of their commitment to the system that they live in, that's a challenge, and saying degrowth is one thing. making to growth something that is politically palatable is different. there has to be a reduction of uh of consumption in the west just by virtue of people won't want to do it as much, it's not going to be like people like oh it's you need a and the thing is is under neoliberalism yeah like de growth in the west it would be uh soilent and uh and those roach uh uh candybars. from Snowpiercer neoliberal de growth is yeah genocidal like neoliberal anything is going to be genocidal as resource constraints and and distributing uh and climate change uh instability ratchets up but a socialist degrowth would just happen naturally because people wouldn't need as much stuff because they wouldn't need to be replacing their uh their... their alienated spirit, so the way to talk about it is to talk about like the first step, like so don't talk about degrowth, because now you're arguing about whether de-growth is good or not, oh good, this is useful, work from degrowth to politics and then start over again, work from anything, and it's like, no, you need more tech, yes, you need more tech, and the tech needs to be socialized, work from there to politics, don't argue on the on the abstract level of an idea. and those are two different, that's a different question than where we're trying to get to, so those are two arguments that should be had, but they should not determine present action and i feel like people have substituted arguing for like which brand of communism, what flavor, what type of uh socialism will work, and the thing is you can only refine that so much online, eventually it has to turn into action, and if you're taking the action at that abstract level to now, you're going to get frustrated at give up again and go back to the computer, because it's not applicable, it's a level of abstraction that's for that is not related. to your daily life, so you got to work back from your conclusions de growth is a correct conclusion under some circumstances, green like an industrial job guarantee and like a new industrial revolution is also true and necessary to an extent, you have to bring them back down to the level of politics to move forward enough to know what the mix will be when the moment comes that it becomes something too. enact, right, when and where, and that is going to be determined in the future, so we have to determine in the now, how to create a space where the left is as strong as possible, how to get to a point where people are willing to act on their belief in some symbolized. We are both, we are waiting for the moment at the symbolic level, but we're acting to bring it about at the material level, and the thing is is that we're moving towards a goal, but we're moving, it's like we got a carrot on a stick in front of us, we got to watch our feet though, you want to look at the carrot once in a while, make sure that it's still there and it didn't fall off the stick or get blown off by wind or a bird took it, but you have to keep your if you're on a treterous terrain, which we are, you got to keep your eyes on the feet on your feet, or else you're going to trip, see everyone's asking me, how can we do it, i don't know, because it's not at that level yet, we're not at the abstract level, the left isn't a level of power to consider degroating anything. people couldn't even degroth the mold, i couldn't even degroth the mold in my own damn bathroom, am i right folks? the left is in a position to do nothing, to act in no way because it doesn't have power, so it must build power. that answer to that question is too close at the too close at hand to the people who need to do it to be answered in the etheric plane, so yeah. and basically uh, I'm taking the can down the road because this is just such an unstable moment, it feels wildly unstable, but the thing is, there are spontaneous reactions, you know, like the 1905 Russian revolution, obviously not comparable in a lot of different ways to our current situation, at every level, all of the political parties that have been trying to agitate against Zardom were completely shocked when it broke out. It was all through spontaneous action, they had helped bring it about through their agitation partially, but they were all surprised by it and then they had to change to adapt to the new situation, and we all find ourself in that situation. Right now we're waiting for the uh, for the North Sea fleet to go around Africa. I do not do fat dabs. never done a dab, i mean i've, i've hit the dab of course, as we all have, who amongst us doesn't enjoy hitting the dab, when do i think restaurants will be back, that's an interesting one, i think it's going to be um hm, that's really interesting because uh, obviously they want everyone to go back to eat immediately uh, but people want a guy, but the good news for them is that if people do really start dying now in big numbers the way they're predicting, people will get more used to it, and that will drive them basically to go. distract themselves more from that horror by going back to the restaurants, but uh, there's going to be such a huge gap uh in demand there that I don't know how long it's going to take, uh, on their way to Iceland, I've been to Iceland. we are beautiful, but it's also a volcano, remember that thing blew up, it's clapping time, folks, I think cities are gonna stay close for a while, but that's going to pose problems, obviously. Will the USPS die? I mean, the trajectory is it will be taken over to some degree by and replaced by something like Amazon, right? I mean, that just seems to be unless something intervens and it could, it seems like that. is the course, yeah, the thing is is that one thing that might honestly happen that we on that we are underestimating the possibility of is that there is just they do just go hogwild that even even these like uh you know neoliberal wahabists in charge they just open the spiggot uh and you know instead of just doing the the the direct transfer to corporations they've done, actually start putting money out there uh just to keep the lights on uh and and they would do that to the least extent they would feel like they would have to keep the situation stable and that would be something i guess like finally instituting at long last at UBI just to get enough demand in the economy to hope to start a uh a kensy and but that depends on a lot of things including how bad climate change gets and how quickly and like the if if oil continues to not make be worth anything that's an x- factor too that i have no idea how you factor in, but it's not good either way. yeah, i mean it would have to be like, i don't think it would be a monthly thing, that would that would be terrified that that would turn into a... so like social security checks, but I could see them like cutting like $1200 checks every like two or three months on a ad-hock basis, classic kick the can down the road, because that's all they can do, like that's late late stage capitalism is just kicking the can down the road until something happens, what you're really intervening for, if you have an interest in investment in like the government, what you're really intervening waiting for is another technological like uh inflection point that uh solves a lot of your underlying problems of distribution and again gets and and that puts profit back into the system uh but if that's not coming and man i don't know if it it doesn't sure doesn't look like it uh then they're going to just keep kicking the canton the road crumbles off the end of the bridge uh Oh yes, gelly Rouble, Hitler's niece, he probably killed her, I mean he was ate off Hitler, right? I mean, he's a off Hitler, some is his his niece who had a very weird relationship, mysteriously commits suicide during his rise to power, I'm not going to suspect, my first suspect isn't going to be Adolph Hitler, like the worst guy ever, yeah, I'm just going to make a bazy and inference that it might have been Hitler, they clapped, it's just they lot, it's losing a little energy, it's like anything. like you kind of get used to you kind of like clap it up and then it gets less novel and then you kind of and then you either pater it out or you know at some point you give it a little bit more and it takes back up again it's in a loll right now for sure that's very nice of you to give Hitler the benefit of the doubt all right I'm going to I I think I've realized what's happening is that when I get to the level of like. because one, it's so far away from the reality, and to I feel so sort of unmored still a little bit. I'm still coming into my daily understanding of myself uh so I think tomorrow uh if you anybody who's tuning in tomorrow who's watching uh I would like to do some history questions I had a lot of fun talking about Napoleon uh couple days ago so let's uh let's talk some uh some movies maybe and uh and history would be fun tomorrow all right. uh the the twitch videos are a few days behind being up on youtube but they're all on twitch for now well that's just it this person says if i'm not well read how the hell you learn about wallenstein that's just it you learn about wallenstein you don't have to read him boom because it's not like anybody's going to really challenge you on your knowledge of it. because nobody else has read him, nobody else has read him either, which means the people who have read him aren't going to get other people to really get it, and so they don't talk about it at a very uh advanced level and so nobody feels the need to, like that's how like the incentive system of of talking about politics and history and stuff on the internet is to learn less, i know that happened to me, typing, ooh, that's a good one, all right, i got some stuff. to think about for next week or for tomorrow, typing is very good, and the thing is is the discourse is all cliff notes and like that's inevitable, it has to be, but it's what are in the notes, we pick the bad things, we picked kind of vapped things to be in the notes, ah the German pesant war, that's a good one too, that one's that one's very interesting to talk about in context of uh protestantism. i they're also doing a uh robford movie with uh with damian uh lewis as rob ford like in a fat suit very funny oh cromwell cromwell would be very good all right i'll talk to you guys uh tomorrow bye-bye
