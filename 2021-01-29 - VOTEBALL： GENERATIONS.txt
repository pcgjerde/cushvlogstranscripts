 wasn't says it wasn't god damn it fuck oh my god wait a minute now ah did i do it oh i did it oh i don't i got you know what i did guys you want to know what i did i fucking turned it off and turned it back on again. No, okay, boomer, that's why will that will never affect me, because d, of course I'm a fucking boomer, that's like saying okay, mammel, I do not have any kind of sense of uh, insecurity about my generational. cohort i am, i am old for a millennial and i am old for a millennial, like i'm i'm one of the oldest millennials and also i've always been like at the very far edge of uh the whole scene, you know, one of those people, stop listening to new music once i turned like 22. Although I do think it's funny that now I'm going to try to fucking expound on some bullshit that's supposed to be pseudo profound and it's going to be on the heels of having like spent almost half an hour fucking around with my phone before I turned it off and turned it back on again so I've already impeached my credibility as a fucking interlocutor before we've even begun so that's always a good way to start but I'm all about transparency as a way to undermine judgment and protect onesself it's very good move it's a smart. move oh the insta stream was, i thought it was the twitch deal and i thought twitch was having problems and so i just tried to do it on instagram, but then it was fucked up there too, so that was i realized nope, it is my phone, and then i thought, well what's the last thing i could possibly do, i could fucking turn it off and turn it back on again, because i'm pretty sure what is happening is that even though i was connected according to the computer with the wi-fi uh that it wasn't really there like because whatever happens. when you haven't turned the phone off and on again recently enough, and so I literally just blew in the fucking cartridge, so it could have been muncher, that scamp, that mischievous scamp, it just occurred to me, I can't believe how long it took to think about this, with muncher being this avatar of our like joyless consumption at the end of history, like 40 years of being slimer, just consuming, consuming. as a hungry ghost with no anima, no uh reason for being because we've been stripped of our of our control of our our lives and become beings of just pure uh consumer hedonic uh uh exanguination of spirit, like just the the hungry ghost of buddhism literally after 40 years we're we're now blue and pained and in misery and what does munch or munch, what is depicted behind him in that? 3d tableau they unveiled, corn, he munches fucking corn, the only agricultural, corn and soy are basically our agricultural exports, not just our exports, the basis of our heavily subsidized uh fucking monsanto franken diet that we all eat, corn in the corn in everything thanks to high fructose corn syrups corn in fucking gas tank as i said on the iowa state fair dock that we did, you could build night, you could build the twin towers out of corn and crash them into 747s made of corn every day and you would not run out of corn, it's in plastic, it's everything and that's muncher, that's us sucking the corn, anyway that's not what i was coming to talk today about, i have an actual point here, that's i called this one a vote ball sequel because i feel like i'm getting another piece of the puzzle together that has made me pretty confident that i can now really start to try as people have asked me to to put something down on paper buse i felt like there's been a missing piece a way to talk about things a way to approach the subject that's made it hard for me to imagine a coherent thing out of it that i could move forward with now i think i have it but first let me say that the other day i said that i uh knew how the what the ending of trading places was, and I explained it and I asked if that was correct, and most people said that's right, but I did get a DM from someone wh pointed out that there's one detail on me. which is that they did not take Denholm elliot the butler's money to Chicago to buy the frozen concentrated orange juice because this is a futures market as the guy pointed out to me, these are commodity futures. what they were doing is they were taking his money to act as collateral to make a margin that to and then like basically taking on the assumed debt uh implicit in that arrangement selling their uh future contracts. is in saying, i will buy, i will deliver you frozen concentrated orange juice at this date, for this price, and they sold those at the height of the frenzy, and then after the real crop report came out, we likes, oh no, there's not going to be that much demand for oranges, because we're going to have a glut of oranges, it collapsed, and then uh, they bought those contracts at that point and pocket. did the difference by just literally being the middleman, and that comes down, the reason i didn't know that is because that i didn't really understand that, i really hadn't uh fully internalized that that's what a future's market is, like you're literally just it's just time, it's not the commodities themselves, so that's a mayapa, i didn't get that part right, but what i come here today to try to do is take us from where we we're talking about like the social base of this baronial revolt we're seeing now, the beautiful boters against global capitalism and we talked about their uh their like demographic and geographic distribution, their politics and all that stuff and how that is the actual like power structure that is resisting capitalism, not the people, not uh uh because because yes we are all being alienated by it but alienation is being uh gathered around the cultural uh concepts generated by that culture, that those regional barenies basically, and uh and as such like we're not actually um, we're not actually seeing any real combat about the underlying system of economic exploitation undergrting both flavors of capitalism, both essentially it's essentially about... of time, it's it's the future versus the past of capitalism, and then the present is like the crucible of their conflict. And we are subject to this dispute, and we can pick sides, but that's because we're being, we don't live as as as workers, we live as uh, as consumers, of spectacle and of everything, munches as it work, uh, and That's as far as good as far as it goes, but the one other thing that I have kind of been knowing at and trying to understand and I've used the college thing a lot that people are sick of me talking about college as like a way to try to get at understanding the dynamic here, but it and it all felt clumsy, I felt like I was onto something but it felt clumsy and this is what really made it click for me is that forget about college necessarily. What we're talking about is so we've got two political wings. right, we've got the two battles, the two, the two superstructural battles, or the superstructural battle between the two uh types of capitalism as reflected by the political parties that they uh, are represented by right, the democrats and the republicans and so we talked about the voters and that's the social base of uh of the republicans, we haven't talked as much about the social base of the Democrats, but as you can imagine, it is the white people wh instead of being local barons, instead of controlling capital in fixed positions, like franchises or oil extraction industries or anything else, um, they uh were they work their way through the credentialing process to apply their minds to gain high status, relatively high-paid work in the professional managerial class, that's the voters like obviously at the top the billionaires, but these are the voters, because disproportionally the vote people who vote vote most frequently, vote in primaries and therefore shape the like the political environment that we we live in and are just absorb every day, are older, wealthier versions of the voters of both sides, so we are talking here unitedly, even if you say oh they might not technically be capitalists, they have capitalist interest. most of them even these PMC people, they have investments in the market beyond even a 401k in a fucking house, like they had they are invested in the market, they are capitalists the way that the petty burjois. often are where it's not a universal, it's it's not a unrestrained position of you know of capital ownership, but it is their wealth is and their position is inflected with it, so those are the voters, but the politics that we're seeing and the politics that we care about and the politics that we imagine, the politics represented not by cable news, but by the internet, ie, politics as it's understood by... the younger people who don't make up the voting base of politics, but make up the activist base that online and in the real world creates what we call a political like movements, momentum, the left and right as represented not on television, but online, these people are the ones that we all are, and these people are the ones that we are all arguing against and who who we uh spend time to dissecting the motives of and and things like that, because this is the self-consciously political level, who are they? they are, for the most part not working class in the sense of being directly exploited as employees, for their labor as a you, not even getting all of the the the cultural shit that comes when you're dealing with you, a high status jobs. you know like your your uh, your retail workers, your your door dash, whatever, uh, they largely don't vote and don't participate in politics necessarily, because they see it as false because they live too close to the reality of its fraud, which people in the middle are, and when their kids and most most susceptible to creating structures that dominate the thinking that goes on the rest of their life, where they are programmed, "they are too comfortable to have that, they have to be disillusioned, no one at the bottom gets illusioned in the first place, and so that means that we're not talking about uh, the working class in general, and we're definitely not talking about the poor, and more than that, we are not talking about the generationally poor, yes, some of the people in this middle that we're going to be talking about are money poor from poor money families, but they likely have a college degree, and at one point..." generated had ideas of like um um upward mobility and probably more than likely more than that most likely they came up in that middle section of like uh pmc or uh small business small bourgeois or that remaining slice of labor aristocracy that does exist there's still a labor aristocracy folks, it's small and shrinking but it's still there. in the public sector in in trades, it's there, these are the generationally poor, like if they went to college, they were the first members of their family to go, something like that, uh, who are talking about, who actually not only votes, but creates the space of online argumentation, the space of... self-conception, the kind of thing that gets somebody to put on a fucking Hawaiian shirt and walk outside during a riot with a gun, or make somebody decide to go out and throw a brick at a cop, like these things are not created by our social relationships near so much as they are created by our pseudo relationships between the internet and ourselves, because where else are we getting anything, that is where we live, we all know it, who these people are are the children of those people at the top, they are the downwardly mobile children, they are the children who went to college with the expectation that life would be something like their parents lives, if and if they did the things that their parents told them to do, and not just their parents, everything around them told them to do, they had a social contract in their hand, and then they graduated from college and it got resinded, these are the... people, maybe they fail sonned into their parents basement and became pepes, maybe they uh became a fucking DSA member, whatever the hell it is, it all starts with taking that first step off after college and just tumbling into a fucking abis, which no one had prepared you for, and that's that's feeling that fall, that's what's powering politics at the level, of activism, activism, remember, because if it's not, if it's passive spectacle observation, it's just tv, and it will just be continued with being what it is, any anything, any illusion we have, we can shape the system away from total annihilation, it assumes active political participation, not voting and not imagining oneself to have a fucking identity, so that means what we have, since we don't have a social order and we don't live class and we don't for the most part have class struggle in our lives, we have a spectacle and we have consumption, our uh our activism is inflected with that, our ac is spectacular and it is more than anything libidinal, because we are not activating, we are not being being activists on behalf of any sort of universal love, self-abnegating uh um submission to a cause greater than ourselves, because that requires a faith in one another, an emotional connection to other people. both intimately and abstractly that persists beyond one's self-gratifying impulses, that's been scrubbed out of us, that has been bleached out of us, we aren't those people, we live in the culture that they created for a long time, and we see what they what their lives were like, and we use the language that they used, we use the vocabulary and the ideas and the symbols that they use, but they are hollow and empty, but we don't know that, there is nothing that isn't, there's to contrast it with, so everything is ashes, I don't care how religious you are, if you're a fucking Christian in this country, you are as much of a dire, soulless materialist as the most epic bacon fucking uh, our spaghetti monster moderator, and that means that when we become active and the politics we create, and the politics we've created until now, what we are creating is a politics of agrieved customers, because we at a level deeper than thought are operating are being driven forward by pure self, the desire for pure self um uh self-satisfaction with no conception that self is infused with others because we have that drilled out of us, our entire lives. i don't blame anybody for acting that way, and that is why when i say this, i'm saying, i'm not saying, i'm not accusing anyone of anything, i'm not saying. anything bad about anybody, I'm including everyone who is listening to this, myself, the entire politically active, second generation, dispossessed, downwardly mobile Americans who make up the political class now, the active political class, they don't have any other way to be, this is the only way they have to be, now people who have politics that they think are good, like to think that they work thought themselves to those politics and that... what made them uh not selfish, made them like act for socialism and fight for socialism, it's because they had some sort of conversion, something about them was different and special, and it really isn't that, it's really which shoot which demographic uh um corn shoot you get pushed down by through basically almost entirely chance, and that's what sorts you, not any virtue on your sort, it's like fucking plinco. you end up in a shoot thanks to banging into things that are based on your race, gender, uh, uh, class, where uh, geography, everything, injury, disability, these things are shaping things, not some universal drive towards transcendental, you know, politics, which you need to have to power of meaningful left, but no one knows that because they don't have anything to contrast it with, and anybody. else is lives, and so if all we know is our lives as consumers in this society, and we relate to this new retraction of the social contract as consumers, our desire will be to speak to the fucking manager, it will be to complain to someone in power so that they change it, because the customer is always right, well the reason we're so fucking people are so pissed is cuuse the customer is no longer. right if he ever was, it was a fucking con that was run, and now at the end of the line, the reality has been revealed and how are we going to play deal with it? and so our politics, which we think are activists and we think are moving us towards a better world and are generated by you know real human. solidarity, and they are at some level, because once you start acting that way, you start realizing, oh, the world, there is this thing better than me, oh my god, there is sacrifices that means something, and that changes you, but you're still embedding all those experiences on top of this ricky structure that's created because you think that politics is complaining to someone else until they fix it for you, because we have no understanding of ourselves as social coordinated actors, we are only individual isolated actors and consumption is our expression of autonomy and action, it's the only thing we can do, and so we do it, and so if you want to talk about every fucking pathology in politics, cancel culture and fucking uh uh the rise of fascism and the question of is it fascism and the question of oh you know what what could you say slurs in the ts all of these things are pseudo controversies this arguments to be had that are being indulged by people who think they're acting out of altruistic instincts but are truly just trying to get their fucking rocks off all of it is yelling at someone who you can is responsible for your pain, that's it, and it's disguised as leftism, it's disguised as rightism, obvious, all of it is fake, it's a fucking masquerade to to hide from ourselves the reality that they were just yelling at a customer service rep. what is twitter, what is social media, but an unmoderated customer service chat room to the United States of America, where we say, uh, fascis in the streets, fix this uh, wow, uh, record setting, global warming, uh, excuse me, anybody, that's it, and no one is paying attention, no one is recording any of this, uh, your call is not uh important to us, you will not be held after for a quiz on your happiness with the interaction, you get nothing, you have to make doe, and so we make a politics of sadism. of punishing people that we can imagine are responsible because we are cut off from even imagining productive politics that challenges capitalism from a position of strength and solidarity that transcends race, transcends gender, transcends generation, but is unified around an understanding of humanity that insists that there is is more to the human experience than can be expressed in numbers, which is the drive of the capitalist algorithm, expulling the soul out of humanity, like kalima pulling out fucking Indiana Jones's heart, and so take something like uh, the woke versus unwoke question on the left, oh slurs, oh should we say slurs to when we're doing socialism uh or is that you know alienating, you're talking on behalf of people who aren't there and you're only making it an issue, you're making it an issue preemptively, these things are not emerging from like real uh connection or real events, they are all people hypothetically creating. situations to then get mad about, that's it, before they even come up, if they came up in the subject of struggle, a lot of this shit would disappear, like you should say slurs, i shouldn't say slurs, why would anybody be really cared about the issue at hand, who is going to a fucking like a meeting to unionize a workplace or a meeting with an activist group, why would they care about their if they can say slurs and why would anybody else care? were said incidentally, they would have bigger shit to worry about, everything flies off into neurotic flights of fancy, because we're not looking to fix anything, we can't even imagine committing ourselves enough for body and soul and heart to do that, we are looking for someone in our vicinity to blame and scream at. I remember the... DSA convention I went to, this is 2017, this is right after DSA blew up after the Trump uh election, and we all went there as like press, I tried to actually go there as a uh, as a uh delegate for the the Cincinnati DSA, but I ended up not doing that, and there in the lead up to it there was a big controversy because a lot of the delegates said that they weren't getting enough money from national to... pay for travel to since Chicago and like and that the that the stuff that was there which was like there was discounted uh like living arrangements provided and there were meals and stuff but and was like subsidized, but it wasn't free, and so people got insanely angry about that and started like yelling about how this was you know classist and it was, it was showing you that the poor couldn't uh involve themselves in this, and you know, in the moment, those sides seem to be very, like that seemed to be a meaningful debate about you, how do we extend democracy out and how do we recognize things like class privilege and and access to resources, how do we about it, by definition weakens the organization, like the idea that it's all good, like I'm sorry, like the idea that you're going to do public struggle sessions in an organization that's trying to recruit people, which means that you're involving people who are just looking out from afar, you're demanding that they take a position on arcane note matters like this before they can even enter the tent, why would that not scare people away, and for what benefit? you could figure this shit out, and it doesn't take people being cops and it doesn't take uh people being wreckers. all it takes is everybody looking for an outlet, looking for a manager to yell at, and it's not their fault, they're captured by this as much as anybody, and nobody's going to think or argue their way out of these conflicts, because they're serving a deeper need than anything rational, so you cannot break off from them unless you find another place to find that meaning and energy, something outside of that loop, that loop of of of hidonic. exaltation and then despair and that height and that ever heightning need to intensify the cycle in order to make up for the fact that it's fucking wearing off, it always wears off and that you have to seek something else, and that that is why the questions that occupy the minds of people day and out, day in and day out, baffle me sometimes, because the movement that's going to come is going to have a religious, not in a sectarian sense. but in a sense of a articulated spiritual dimension, because it will be arriving alongside and embedded in real struggles between people, where bonds are formed, emotional connections that transcend the rational, accurid, symbolic representation for relations that we have to uh, consol ourselves with, because we build so much of our emotional lives around fake con uh interactions, and that will create uh, when I say religious, I just mean that like if you get into a meeting and you have a conflict with somebody, instead of flying into a fucking rage so that you can make a scene and be a marder and get people on your side in your conflict with the other people in the organization who you've decided are actually the reason we don't have socialism because you're mad at them. if that, you could kind of like work things out more easily, if the hair trigger, if the if that hair trigger wasn't there, waiting to spring on someone else, because that's what we're really there for, if you're really there for something else, then conflicts, holy shit, you can resolve them, you can agree to formats for resolution of issues and go through channels instead of creating dramas that reinforce your... sensual relationship to politics and the reason for it, the reason that this is the dominant form is because the people doing this, they grew up as consumers, they did not grow up alienated from this system, like i was on minions death cult uh the other night, last night and they asked me like a lot of these people who are like you might not the robinhood deal it might not cause a revolution through you know the the manipulation of stocks and but it's going to alienate a lot of people, it's going to disillusion a lot of people away from um away from a believing that the that the capitalism is you know anything other than predation, but I said that we already have a critical mass of Americans who know that already, who don't need to be fucking disillusioned, the poor, and it does not make them into a weapon of political activism because being poor is not. a relationship that builds uh durable, self-sustaining uh conflict with the state the way that labor does. It's got to be from the point of view of labor, that's the only way it's happening, that's the only way that a spark is going to be lit that isn't going to be consumed by this inferno vidiocy, but these middle class kids, like I said, not necessarily uh from the families of the beautiful boating, small bourgeois, ownership class, uh, not necessarily even high level pmcs, but like if we're talking about the last generation to get any of that good. from the post war bubble uh nurses, school teachers, even those labor aristocrats, those few remaining uh, you know, union factory workers, but also like skilled laborers like h-fat guys and plumbers and fucking uh um electricians, like those those guys still exist, the building trades, those guys still exist, and they make middle class externally, bend you towards like trying to seek understanding, and like the more costted you are, the less you see capitalism as it is, and you see the system as it is, the later you come to that. moment of alienation, the harder it is to undo your own programming, so that's why the this coming tide, this rising that may or may not that will come, but may or may not come in time, that's the only open question, is going to come from the real prols, but not that doesn't mean that people who grew up that way and now find themselves like really struggling and therefore reset being said that they're the PMC, hey, am I like, I'm not, I yes, but you are falling, and it's a different relationship to politics, if you can drop that fucking anchor that you're holding, if you can drop that that, if you can kill the fucking Karen in your head, you can join, man, you can find it, come on in the water is fine, it's not here yet, obviously, it well, intendrals and in in grassfire. conflogrations that exist, but I'm not there, I don't know where they are, sure is around me, but wherever it is, and when it starts coming together, like the fucking the drums, the fucking the drums that's that uh started the Haitian revolution. I was trying to remember where it started boyn or something. I think we're going to do black reconstruction. I don't have a copy yet so might not be right now, but I think we're going to do black reconstruction next. Boy came on, that's it, drums and you can fucking drop this bullshit and get serious, or you can decide, actually no, that's not real because it doesn't give you the juice that's sitting on your... fucking ass gives you and it gives me, like I said, this is all me, I'm literally yelling at myself every time I talk about this shit, just the question is, does this refer, does this make sense to you, does this sound like I'm describing the world, if it does, then standpoint theory can fuck off, yes, I am projecting, I am projecting, 100. the question is, am i projecting out towards something that exists, like yeah, everyone's projecting, that's literally what you do, that's all that, that's all that like thinking is, you're the only point of reference, you are the only point of reference, i'm sorry, doesn't matter how many fucking footnotes you put in your fucking master's thesis, like everyone's projecting, the only question is like who and who makes sense and who doesn't is, does it sound like they're projecting accurately? does it sound like they're describing a universalized experience or are they being bent by neurosis and self-interest into saying something else? No, it's not salipsism because you recognize that what makes truth is not anything in your head, what makes truth is what you can reflect through others, because everybody, that thing about you're the only one, that applies to everybody, so comparing notes, laying experiences on top of each other and seeing what makes what connects, that's it, that's the only real generator of meaning and fact and truth, that's it, nothing can come from within, it can only be reflected backward. yeah, I finally realized that that's like really really what I'm really all about, I'm a feminologist, what's it called a phenomenomenologist? Yeah, that really is me, a phenomenologist, amateur phenomenologist, I'll put that on my fucking uh, because everything else it's like, it's all good, I love it, history, economics, politics, love talking about it, but at a certain level you have to start um, you have to start playing with tools that I don't really handle very well, numbers, for example, there my... fingers are very uh clumsy, so if i can stay up here, that's why i really feel like i'm snapping things together, but then once i try to like come from the other end i got to use numbers, it's not so good, okay that felt really good, so i'm going to i'm going to put together some stuff and i'm going to start writing soon, so look for. to something soon i'm very excited and it'll all and the beauty thing is is that I will preface the thing by saying look uh there you can look like the statements i make in this book, I am not going to cite myself, I am not going to, I'm not going to back it up, I'm not going to have stats, I'm not going to have numbers, they exist and I believe that everything I say will be built on a nice structure of you know well uh integrated you know... uh uh empirical understanding, but uh, they will mostly be taker leave concepts and if you if you if you accept them, I think they really will, they will all hold together, but if you reject any of them, that's fine, and you may have your reasons, but it's up to you to decide, are my reasons good or are they bad, do I really disagree? with this because there is something wrong here or am i looking for something because i don't want it to be right? no, no, people can find their own research, people can, people can, i don't, the whole point is to is to reject that, like that's that's the thing that gets you locked in here, the idea that if you can know to a fine enough degree why something is happening, if you can get a swiss enough, a well timed enough little swiss. of every phenomenon in within like uh the political system that that will help you find the right thing to do, and that's that line will never appear, because if you don't want to cross it, you will figure out a way not to cross it, the line of risk, the line of self sacrifice, you will, if it's always going to be a question of empirical understanding, you will always be able to zenos paradox your way from ever crossing the line. you have to ask yourself deeper questions, and if you want to try to like pull things towards you know more grounded observation to back it up or say, oh yeah, the whole premise of this is wrong, fine, but that's going to be on you, knowing when to quit, knowing your fucking limitations in a world where you can convince yourself that you know everything. That's one of the only ways that you can really uh be productively uh intellectual because that's what allows you to sort of you know showcase your best cut of meat and not the shit that's all cut and and gradiated with bullshit. Uh, the beauty part is is that no matter what happens and no matter what I write in this fucking thing, I will not be held accountable, can't do it, can't be done, can't be held accountable. Sorry, not going to happen, can't be held a counttable, oh can't be hold the counter pull, he's a powerful boys, he's a powerful doors, he looks to look good, but but now I find him, simply unaccountable. accountable boy, they all said, can't be done, can't be held accountable, and like I make fun of that phrase, but look at it, when they say someone needs to be held accountable, they are writing a comment card, because they're not going to do it, what, they're going to post about it, they're going to do, if everyone did the same thing they did to hold the person accountable, what would change about their life, so if that's not it, clear. the implication is someone else is going to do something. i think the real hope, the real thing that drives everyone participating in the political project unconsciously or not is that the way the world changes is that you say things enough, you find the right phrases and the right words and everything clicks and then everyone just changes their view simultaneously and then acts differently because of that, and that's not, that is my friends, idealism. not what does it, it is conflict, forces in conflict, right now we are in the middle of a class war, it's turning into a class genocide, and a lot of that reason for that is that the actual working class is not fighting it, they are essentially just getting merked without putting up a fucking duke because they are not self-conscious and organized as a working class, that project. has not even really begun, there's embers of it from the burned structures that have been destroyed, especially since the 70s all over the world, not just in the United States or even in Europe, and now we have to live in the fucking wreckage and rebuild from it, but that's what's going to fucking move things, not this, not people uh all complaining and unison to some imagined power that will address our grievances, they're in power to or grievances and to only address them in a way that helps them maintain their power, as soon as the power is threatened by your unified demands, those demands will be ignored, which is why people saying that cancel culture is why like discord could get away with cancel with suspending the wall street beats page, like oh, if you guys hadn't created this idea and and precedent that it's okay for tech company. used to censor speech, they wouldn't use speech as an excuse, no, they would use something else as an excuse, they're in charge, they do what they want, and because they are just telling us how it is, and we have nothing to say about it, when they figure out a justification, all they have to do is figure out what the fucking room tone of the cultural moment is and then use that language, if they had to do it during the Bush administration they would have said it was about terrorism, now because the... is different, they'll tell you that it's because it's racist or nazi or something, they'll use the tools that are there, but they get to pick them up, and the reason nobody can accept that, even if they believe it intellectually, is cuuse if you really understand that that's the case, no amount of this bullshit will do the job, no amount of complaining to the manager will do the job, and you have to reorient your understanding of what political action is, and nobody wants to fucking do that because because it looks hopeles and nobody wants to suffer unnecessarily, and the only thing that breaks you through that and lets you do the indie Anna Jones leap of fucking faith into the goddamn hole is if you have a thing beyond reason driving you, an emotion, an emotion that is generated by feeling the transcends language and rationality, otherwise known as faith, not in anything specific. It's all arbitrary, it's all symbology, it's all the things that work, it's the simplest, it is the most, religion is basically getting the the symbols that can that can hold the most emotional meaning in the feuest characters or lines, that's what it is, john brown yourself, indeed, not about the killing, and this is a perfect example. John Brown has become the idea fix of the like online left since 19 since 2016, correct? no one can argue against that, why is he fetishized? because he killed slave owners cuuse he cut the heads off of some fucking slave owners, that's it, because he speaks to the manager and cuts his fucking head off, it's fetishizing violent retribution against our agrieved individuality, our the contract has been breached and someone needs to pay, that's what we're dreaming about, but we still do need John brown, but we need john brown be because what drove him to do that, a thing that violated his christian sensibilities and also made him a fucking marked man for the rest of his life was fate. he saw the moment, the context of that of the of thesoatomy massacre was that a big confrontation had just arisen, a final big like apocalyptic confrontation between the free state forces and the slave uh authorities in Missouri, and there was essentially a the siege of lawrence, a bunch of fucking butternut crackers were were huddled around Lawrence threatening to sack it and and like the the free state governor and government were inside of it, and they backed down, the free state side back down because nobody wanted to spil any blood, certainly not their own, and from that moment, brown knew it was going to happen if it was if there was not an intervention. if he didn't do something to change the cocking contours of the conflict, what would happen is Missouri would end up becoming a slave state, and this was the fear of the antibelum abolionists and nobody talks about it anymore, but it is actually absolutely I think what would have happened. Missouri comes a slave state, unbalancing the uh order of the um uh unbalancing the senate. so that now there's a majority of slave state senators uh and the northern states would have succeeded, the northern states would have just said, you know what, buy, which the federalists threaten to do during the war of 1812 at the Hartford convention, which is one of the things that helped drive a stake through the heart of the federalist project, and then slavery would have persisted because the south would have let him go, good, you guys go, we're going to have our little shitty uh, fucking neo feudal uh suit like pretend to be knights in armor doing tournament jous like a bunch of fruity dick heads and that was going to be what happened unless the stakes changed and so they went and found some fucking uh some relatively low-level uh uh slave state Missourians some of whom didn't even own slaves they were just there to to you know maybe get some land in exchange for votes, cut their fucking heads off, and overnight that changed the stakes of the conflict, so it was not someone's going to pay for the situation they can't change now, some manager is going to get talked to, so I can feel better about my grievance, this is going to materially change the conditions and drive us towards a conflict, which happened after... people talk about the fucking osowatomy creek, but after that happened, brown and his fucking kids and his retinue ran around the whole state of cansas as like a like the wild hunt of medieval fucking Europe, like riding into uh pro- slavery settlements and just rustling cattle and having shootouts with us cavalry and fucking uh doing jail breaks and shit and becoming like legend. figures and drawing two Kansas freestaters who were willing to fucking fight and that's what galvanized northern sentiment to make the democratic compromise that had allowed the uh the democracy to hold together in the face of the wigs splitting up and the you know their opposition becoming hegemonically antislavery that was the last that was the fucking way for thin mint that Mr. Kriosode could no longer fucking uh digest and as soon as as soon as the question of bringing in Kansas became central to the party platforms uh it it was no longer the the democratic party was no longer viable and honestly it might not even have mattered because fucking Lincoln swept the north even more uh because it's not like there were a lot of votes for breck and riger bell anywhere in the northern states even where it was a two man race uh Lincoln cleaned Douglas is fucking. clock and the thing that changed that dynamic and of course there's other stuff and there's no way to say that if he hadn't done oscillotomy creek that like we wouldn't had a civil war like obviously but he help he acted out of a sense of the terrain, he was not acting out of a desire to see vengeance done and to see himself, his blood thirst slated, guy was in his 50s at that point, if he'd wanted that he would have done it earlier, oh man, chinese new year, they're going to rub our asses into it, and we have it coming. so when you think see somebody fetish isac John brown ask like what are you really into this for and hopefully people will get that but like it means more than just symbolizing it you have to interrogate yourself and you have to find you have to log off and not just like not go on the internet not have anything around you at all but yourself to fucking sit with until you hear something buse there's something there we're all drowning it out every fucking second of the day we're like Harrison bergeron, we don't even know we're doing it, you got to fucking sit with it, and then you got to act the people around you, and you got to build those relationships through experience that let you carry through and do things that are against your immediate self-interest, because you're carrying with you a a warmth, that's always there, it's always renewing. That was all right, there you go, so yeah, something's gonna be, it's going to be some stuff like that and whatever I end up writing, I do try that meditate, I've been bad at it lately, but uh, I do like it and I hope to get better at it. and you know it all sounds like a like a retreat to the self, which is exactly what happened after the 60s, but that's inevitable, like I said, this experience does not for most people generate anything differently, and even among people. it does generate something into, their experience might not allow them to activate their new beliefs and they might end up getting just beaten out of them by life. you know, like it is this, it only generates bad uh, you know, it only generates this this empty, hollow depressed life, it doesn't, it it it suppresses the spark of you know of of something beyond that, that the the awareness that you are actually connected to something other than yourself that you're not cut off. and so most people aren't going to be able to do anything effective their whole lives, it's unlikely. the only the things that make it more likely are things like class struggle being articulated as such, which i think is going to happen, but like i said, you know, we're just we're on a time time level situation, but we're mostly going to continue to like in the the majority of all of us, we have to remember this, no matter what we individually have, whatever. if whoever you are when you're hearing this, whatever you decide to do with your life, there's no, there's no likelihood that the that anything like the majority of people is going to have some sort of shocking change of recognition that's not going to happen, they're going to they're going to be they're going to go towards their demographic cohort as long as they are experiencing life uh through the lenses of the consumer, and that's why the 60's fell to that because it was it was a... consumer revolt in the same frame, in the same way, only it was about, it was the high expectations were even higher, they were already getting stuff that objectively we would be drieling for, but because of that they had higher expectations than the culture could give them, and so that was a that was a consumer revolt too, and now we're having another one, the difference is that there is no big bucket of gravy at the end of the rainbow to drown these motherfuckers with, which is what demobilized it last time, there's no, there's no more. fucking there's nothing in the cupboard, full proletarization and deep neopesantization is all we can look forward to, and that terminal crisis, that the the the lack of a uh realistically conceivable alternative to full of miseration if nothing changes, that that's the thing that changes the conditions and spins the fucking can mixes the paint can, and as long as we're a... eyes are open and our hearts are open, we can maybe participate in that, but everything else is for entertainment purposes only, it is not real politics, it is, it is a big. argument of people trying to uh, trying to to find someone to yell at about why, and the left and right are divided demographically, once again, not everyone, but for the most part, white male uh, grew up in the suburbs, especially if the parents are like middle class, but not college educated. Oh, you are going to uh be blaming the blacks, you are going to be blaming the blacks and if you go to college where you learn all about empiricism and about how God is dead and that we are what filled the void and that therefore we have to rebuild the world you know out of dead sticks, well you'll learn about things like uh like the bell curve and you learn about IQ and you learn about uh survival of the fittest and stuff like that and genetics and that gives you a reason to do that. oh, look at that, that's so nice. thank you. if you grew up in like an innering suburb, uh, if you went to, if you uh were went to college and if you aspired to, because of your middle class upbringing, you aspired to a knowledge economy job, you're probably uh on the left somewhere, like this and then the split depends on like the specific conditions of that, so if you uh, if you are one of those, you know, one of those children who got a job in like the PMC Strata, even though it's precarious and like you have a ton of student loan debt it is like a status job relative to you know working at McDonald's or driving an Uber, but you don't have a lot of money uh or I mean but you do have. like a decent amount of money and an expectation of more, like you have that and so you can see yourself as precarious, you can definitely feel agrieved that you didn't get the deal you signed up for, but you are still feeling like you're on a you're on a track, you're probably forwarren, if you went through that uh the whole treadmill and ended up falling, you're probably for burning. so once again. I'm explaining these things, I'm talking about myself and reasonable uh extrapolations from that experience, y'all can tell me if this sounds familiar. All right, cool, I'm glad that makes sense. All right, I'm feeling like I'm ready, buse like the college thing, I felt like that's a good, that is the experience that like delimits this. because we're talking about uh uh, we're talking about people who basically all went to college, they almost all did, but the response to what the hegemonic college like manners of aspiring uh managerial, you know, because there is no more, there's no more dignity in labor, there's only dignity in clicky clack work, um, everybody goes into college expecting that, that's the experience that like generates everything, and that's the experience that everybody who makes culture does, and the people who are moving towards what they think that they should do, which is multiculturalism, which is progressivism, which is materially grounded for ones who are successful, because it means that they have to keep affirming these values in order to maintain their job positions, because it is imposed. it is an imposed thing and those areas, so that's a reason that they have to hold these views, you know, the reason that they have to be a woke, because there's a like a prod on them to do it, um, and then there's the people who say fuck this and become conservative, the thing that distinguishes them is not uh necessarily class, because among these people we can be talking about beautiful boaters kids, we can be talking about professor's kids, doctors kids, cops kids, construction workers kids. and urban and white and other politically active minority, liberal, and the college is just the shoot that they all go through, that's it, and now and that's what I was not really able to articulate and why a lot of people got caught off on caught up on me talking about college that it's not really about college, it's about... geography, it's about whether you grew up around a hegemmonic culture that was uh generated by the global neoliberalized spectacle or in a more uh more socially embedded um regional culture and then they all go to college and then they get sorted into republicans and democrats out of that. and I'm not saying that it's destiny for any individual person, I'm not, and I'm not saying that this is, this describes everybody, I am saying that if you get a bunch of people and they have these experiences, it is these experiences of whiteness in a rural or exurban area versus uh, you know, uh, whiteness in a diversifying, inner ring, wealthy suburb, those experiences produced different. like general reactions and general uh like ideological formations, and those are the things that are uh dictating like the political uh scheme, but that it is sterile, it is not, it is not because it's detached from class politics and class power, in this moment of total immiseration, it is sterile and can only spin its wings and cannot. effectively oppose the full boot of neoliberal uh globalized finance capital because it's only it's being fought on behalf of these retrograde reactionary elements that by their very construct uh nature and structure cannot allow for working class solidarity because they make exclusions on cultural alliance which the liberal ones do too. but they do it on behalf of global capital and the conservative does it on behalf of this this uh these barens, this archipelago of paronial feudal power, but the none of them are doing it on behalf of themselves, as a through class interested as a class project, a class operating as itself and for itself, operating for other classes, for the PMC finance oligarchy. and from the local boat ownership uh class, what will break that is the emergence from below, the orthogonal uh release of a working glass energy, the drums at boys canane, that's what it'll do it, and the only and this is not should not black pill anyone or like oh politics is useless. "it should free you, these things that feel intractable conflicts between sides that are dred, like this is the western front, and you can just bypass it, you can just say, oh, that's not for me, you can be like that drill tweet where he gets the bill from the fucking waitress and he goes, no, thank you, I don't believe in that. you can liberate yourself from caring, which is what is oppressive, anxiety as i have said, that is the electric prop.". on the nuts that keeps you in line, anxiety, because we're too well off to fear, we have anxiety, and that and anything that loads you up with more of it, paralyzes you further is not good for you, so you can fucking yes, you can do the magino move, you can go through Belgium and fuck this whole bullshit off, kill the canon in your head, that's it. All right.
