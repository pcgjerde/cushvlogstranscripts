 I hear marriot she's static on my radio and the cool they glow in the dark but I'm here with her incennata and here in echo park comeliter hold me tighter I think I'm sinking down and I'm all sling out on heroin and the outskirts of town, I'm sitting here playing solitare with my pearl handle. cut off the welfare chat uh hi folks, how's it going? is everyone okay, is everybody still practicing self care during uh this whole coup situation where the government is being overthrown by the united uh... by uh it's fascist base if you want to believe that uh and i hope with a couple days and a little bit of uh thought people have calmed down a little bit reflected they've seen Trump go on tv and say I didn't mean it I was kidding I was kidding now of course that doesn't mean that's political violence is over it doesn't mean that q or the Trump base or anything like that are going to be mollified I say that stuchastic political violence is going to be a pretty much permanent feature of uh at the very least the Biden presidency and maybe just a new feature of American political life uh like endemic diseases are now and of course some of that will be just the native energies of these people who still feel cannot reconcile themselves to political uh uh adulthood i guess you'd say and the one that are going to be ginned up and supported and carried out on behalf of the government as part of their their sensuous little game of domestic gladio that they like to play the little dabble in uh in exacerbating threats in order to justify draconian crackdowns, but i will say that what we're seeing right now the beginning of like we're starting to see big time charges being filed on some of these guys they found uh and they tracked who wants were in the capital, um, they're already talking about how there's going to be live ammo uh in the guns of the national guardsman on inauguration day. uh, the male fist of the state is coming out in order to assert authority. now that doesn't mean these people are going to listen, they have every reason to believe that this thing is going to work out for them because at the end of it, fundamentally, they believe in America, they believe to a religious extent in the... United States and its political project, that's why they believe, that's why they have to believe such a convoluted insanity and have to have such paranoid politics, because it's the only way to square the circle of living in this country, living in this country, experiencing it the way that we do, the the nightmare of misery and emisenration and humiliation that it is, but that it is also everything that we are psychically supposed to believe it is, and these people are the people who believe that shit, because they've never been, there's never been a reason for... not to, they have never been confronted with the state as such telling them, no, in fact, the entirety of the political reality of the last 40 years has been managing the ego, basically of this segment of the population, by which I mean broadly, the middle tier of white Americans, income wise, and and like in relationship to capitalism, not just the small petty bourgeois, plenty of workers like the whole fucking argument about oh everybody at the capital was a small business tyrant and actually no they were sons of the soil obviously it was both obviously there's no way they were all boat ownership dealers a good deal of them were but there's also there's no way they were all like horny-handed sons of fucking toil either they were a mixture because that is the we're talking about people who identify not by their fucking class because nobody does that in this fucking country of course they're not fucking self-consciously working class or fucking uh little uh petit bourgeois, the whole point of America is to make those categories not something that people live with, they live with other categories, racial, nationalist uh geographic, and that's what people carry with them. and in the 1970s the United States was, we all got one way or another the Howard Beal speech, the one that not the one he yells at everybody, but the one he gets from Ned Baity, I've read it on this on the stream before, you have meddled with the cosmic forces of nature, Mr. B. there are no nations, there is no west, there is only Union carbide and intnt and atnt, that's everybody got that message in the 70s behind in front of closed doors. now in the political realm what that ended up meaning is is you had the democratic and the republican parties both dealing with this new reality. okay, the whole point of American politics, which had been since the new deal about distributing the gains of America's industrial economy, will now be changed, the game done change, there's going to be no more spoils to give out. uh, if we're going to maintain profit, it's going to be at the expense of work, and at the expense honestly, not just of workers, but of these small business people, because yes a lot these people in Washington are small business people, does that mean that their small businesses are doing well? do you think it's likely that they're incredibly successful? some of them are, but I guarantee you a lot of them, including the the pool uh cleaning, pool supply company lady who voted for Obama, by the way, who got merked by the secret service, she yes, she had a pool pool owner, pool supply company, how much was she in debt though, how much are everyone, how much is everybody who is not at the very commanding heights of capital or has some sort of... culturally uh um attractive job that allows them to be independent from like the sheer exploitative machinery uh how fucking comfortable are any of them even these small business tyrants who are precarios and you can say that they don't deserve to feel that angry they don't deserve to be that outraged because hey everybody else is doing worse, nobody else, i'm not living anybody else's life, nobody lives anybody's live but their own and relative fucking every belief every feeling relative, so the precariity that goes up and down through American society and has since the 70s, I'm sorry, even bad naughty small business owners are going to feel it, maybe they don't deserve to feel it, maybe they shouldn't be so babyish about it, but that's not that doesn't do anything to them, that doesn't convince them, they didn't go through the ideological carwash to like unpack their fucking napsack of privilege and say uh, you know, and and say thanks for all the luck they have, and then not try to make the world better. they believe in America, because when we all got that message in the 70s, oh yeah, no, this is over, America, as you thought of it, this land of opportunity, that's over with, it's going to be an ensurfening, everyone is going to become a thrall and we have to, because because your day having a say in this is over as working people, as non capital holders, so what are we going to do about it? well, the people who make up now, almost the entirety of the democrats, college. educated uh professional whites and and uh African-Americans, basically there's other groups in there, but those are the two big groups that make up the significant portion of the de and young people of course, the younger generation, but largely uh sorted by college, either the older, wealthier ones, the ones made sure Biden was the nominee, or the younger, poorer ones, they all went to college, and then you've got African Americans, and then you've got these racial groups that we treat like they're black, but aren't, because the experience of race in America is worked because we have black people in this country, and that relationship is different than the relationship between any other um ethnic minority and the United States, it just is, and trying to tack them together, that's one of the reasons so many liberals are baffled by all these working class uh minorities voting for Trump, so those two groups of people. because it wasn't just telling people, yeah, no, that's over, being able to just have a decent middle class life, with any job you can find, no, that's over with, that's gone, that was okay for college educated whites, because the new world we were going to get was going to be a knowledge. economy where the fact that you went to college and the fact that you learned all this stuff and the fact that you learned the vocabulary is going to give you a chance to survive and in fact thrive, you can still get a house, all those atari democrats that represented the 70s suburban explosion, the uh they represented people who could still realistically get the American dream because they had they were part of the knowledge economy, and ever since then those people, those democrats, those people who line up with the... That's have done so on the assumption that well, yeah, things are bad in this country, but honestly more than anything, it's because of these backward ass other white people, the ones who couldn't get with the program, the... or why we can't have nice things even though the reason is because the the the uh drive train of like working class pressure on the political um economy was disengaged and so now it's just an inner capital battle, there's no working people involved in any way, it's pure that seated the table that existed and that set the table for post war social democracy in the United States into a greater degree in Europe, that's gone, so now we just have this culture culture battle, but that's okay if you're... educated because you could still get a job. now the younger ones of that, they're they're looming into a world disabused of that notion, that's why a lot of them are burning supporters, that's why a lot of them call themselves socialists, because they have a more sophisticated critique of why things are the way they are than the lumping reactionaly. but when it comes to shove they're going to pick the democrats because that's the only game in town. uh, so whether they are coersed by a belief that adhering. these rules and adhering to democratic norms and the democratic party social agenda, social gospel will be good for them materially, or that it's just good on its own, like they've been convinced, they have been ardeologically carwashed even beyond uh the point of personal uh self-interest, either way, they have accommodated themselves to this order, African-Americans, they were the the the the leadership and political stratter were just bought into the democratic party mechanisms and then everybody else had the unfucking fist of the state smash onto them, that's where you get the drug war, that's where you get a a a zero tolerance policy to get to say, hey, no fucking uh, yeah, yeah, no, you know how there was that brief period when it looked like we might open the doors to post war prosperity to you, yeah, no, that's over, but don't you fucking get any ideas about it, we killed all the fucking panthers, we killed Martin Luther King, we will kill you, and if you try to fucking make a dollar outside of uh, this new order, like drugs or something. "it's going to be an excuse for us to throw all of you in prison and then put our fucking dumb ass uh grab student kids into your fucking housess and that left the broad swath of white Americans who did not go to college either because or went to college and explicitly rejected the whole uh deal for idiosyncratic ideological reasons or whatever those people the the the successful" were the ones who created the post war conservativism, like they saw the deal and they spit the bit, they said, no, we're too psychotically devoted to these uh, these jaxonian notions of freedom, because we're programmed that way, and now though, like it's increasing, it's more and more people who aren't successful, even though the republican party has only benefited the wealthy, because the the the republican party is the only counter. articulation to the neoliberal status quo, and the actual point of conflict is the one that's been the same since the dawn of the republic, which is the conflict between finance capital, which is the overalling and and and and at the end of the day, governing form of capital in this country and in the world and uh and um locally, regionally bound resource capital uh extraction indusries and then all accompaning like local uh economic activity where you have local stakeholders who emerge and that's been the war since since the fucking dawn of the the of the federalist and the uh the democratic republican and at every point that that power source the American local baronry basically has been bought off and that local and and one way that the working class in general has been bought off is that they'... essentially for the white ones after World War II gave an entrepo to that broad bareny that broad American like regional capital bareny uh the you could get even if you worked at a factory you could get a little lot with a fucking yard you could be a little lord you could be a lord of your own land even if you weren't uh the a landlord of any other kind and even if you worked for a living and so when that 70s uh reality check hit, Carter shows up and says, I'm going to explain to all these people in a nice quiet voice why we can't have nice things anymore, and they're going to understand, yes, it's good for us to want the soul of America to be nourished and not our bodies and that we need to be uh, you know, virtuous and blah blah blah. Reagan was there to say, hey Moron, idiots, you just tell them that everything's going to be fine because you're going to cut taxes. You say, yes, things are going to get worse, but it's because the government is. all of them on their terms, now it's not like the democrats are really trying to stop any of that, but the drive train of politics is this activated like small holding white uh petty bourgeois that is being uh casseted that is not getting the reality check that isn't isn't getting the beal speech is just getting a pat on the back and said no no it's just those it's just the nasty tax man that's the reason that you're not more successful how about oh how about here's some more more mortgage uh uh uh deductions, here's some more like uh the degree to which we do uh safety net shit anymore, you're going to be the beneficiary of all of it because we're gonna subsidize home ownership and give you your little fieftums and give you free cheap credit that you can borrow against so you can open 500 different fucking like uh uh nightclub themed vape shops and uh and uh rock and roll uh uh rock and roll karayoke bars with the shooting ranges and fucking dealerships, and what we're seeing since the collapse, 2008 collapse is is that we can't buy them off anymore, they can't be bought off anymore, the the shit is coming to them, the poor whites, the poor whites, the ones that didn't have access to the bareny, they've been killing themselves, literally, they have been literally killing themselves with fentanill uh trying to get disabilities checks and and and and living the lives of despair that are the usual outcome of being... totally unconnected from any ability to assert political control over your life and any control over your economic condition, the ones who are in the middle, those middle ones, those are the ones who are most agitated, most anxious, the most most afraid of falling, and those are the ones who make up the republican base now, and because they believe in America, they even though their politics are totally in co-hate and they have no actual formal meaning and they don't have any, it's it's an articulation of resistance to neoliberalism, but it's baffled by the fact that everybody's just watches tv for the last 60 fucking years and nobody actually has a lived experience to compare with anybody else's. we only share fantasies, we only swap and share swap and share fantasies with one another, and so all of this alienation, whether it's from uh precarious uh petit bourjois or precarious uh non-college educated uh labor workers, no matter what their income is, uh, it's expressed by this spectacular fixation, this emotional connection to Trump as a delivery figure, because what he delivers them from is this political stailmate, that they are realizing will doom them, but because they believe in America, they have to find an answer within it structures, within the democratic part, within the republican party and within within the republican party, the figure of Trump who mirrors them in their selfishness and short-sitedness, and as such is acting. not for any concern about institutions, which is demystifying the institutions and teaching these people that the institutions aren't real and they can just open the door and that that fucking like oh that velvet rope you can just step over it and of course that's because they've been allowed to do this because white work white uh middle strata political alienation has only been beneficial, it has only flown to the benefit of the republican party and it is flown to the benefit of the corporate democratic party by always driving the the uh the republicans to the right, meaning we are forced because we're locked arm- in arm like in fucking uh Sydney Portier and Tony Curdis and the defiant ones, we're locked of the republicans for life, so if they go right, we have to go right too, it's good for everybody, but now you have a genuine conflict between this, this this uh assumed this faith in the political subjectivity. uh that these people have uh and the cold heart fact that at the end of the day we're just humoring you people nash international finance capital runs this shit and we will put up with this stuff but at the end of the day if you really get in trouble with maintaining these flows of capital we are going to have to give you the sit-down talk and i think what we're seeing here is going to be the beginning of the sitdown talk and i think it's going to see big time prosecution. for everybody went in that place and you're going to see surveillance, Biden is already talking about his first order business, a domestic terrorism bill, we're going to have a white war on terror or a war on white terror, i guess and it's going to be the same sort of color-coordinated terror alerts, it's going to be the same collection of FBI and uh encouraged and in fact uh conceived uh terror attacks thwarted, real one's happening, and the core of this group, these unassimilated true believers in America, only been able to believe in America for so long because they have been humored and their political uh their economic um destinies have been have been protected from the ravages of the market, the the the disruption. of the global economic structure as it fastens its fucking tendrerals over every passed of all life, but now the bill has come to, there's nothing in the cupboard left to fucking humor you people, we can't do anything about coronavirus, we can't do anything about offshoring, we can't do anything about anything, because both of our both these parties are committed to this, and the thing is is that the republicans now are going to have to confront their base in a way they never wanted to do, and they're going to have to come to some sort of uh some sort of accommodation and my guess is what it's going to be is that the more well off, the more successful, the more charismatic, the the the ones with more to lose are going to be are going to be brought in by a claim that look, yeah they ripped us off, they stole the election, but if you retake take over the republican party from inside, you can stop it, and if you're on the outside of it, you can work for this, the same way that the left is sheep dipped into the democratic party, and they will accept it, at least. because there's options there, you could run for office, i mean my god, all these congressmen are up for re-election next year, every single one of them every one of these person could be fucking replaced by a local beautiful boater uh or even a not so beautiful boater if they were charismatic enough, and if you can't do that, hey you can stream, you can uh become an influencer, you can you can uh, you can make that grind work, the less competent, i guess, the less the less stable emotionally and financially are going to have to find out that the government exists, not as their friend, that the government is not their friend and that the cops are not there to help them, and how they respond to that is, i'm very interested in finding out, but this is all white people getting the reality check that they that we spent 40 years, the people in power spent 40 years allowing to go unchecked, because it was it was possible, there were those bubbles, there was a nice real estate bubble and and and tech and whatever else, but once you've reached the point where all growth comes from uh disrupting sectors meaning reducing income, reducing uh job um security in the name of flexibility, that's the only place to find any money under the fucking couchess and and where uh the the ability to even be a small business owner is going to go away. and every and you're going to have to be proletarianized, which is to lose your freedom, like we've talked about how American freedom is tied up in ownership, first it was land, but now it is of a business. this is the end of the myth, this is the closing of the frontier, and these white people are going to have to learn their lesson. now it will be much softer of course than the lesson that was administered to uh black people in this country. but I think it's you're going to see it and it's going to get coded as racial justice, it's going to get coded as progressivism, it's going to be what we get instead of any kind of meaningful push towards uh dealing with climate change or the fucking the the the fact that uh that it is basically impossible to have a life that is compatible with what American existence is in the current context. and that's why all the fucking argument about like oh are they working class or they uh boat owners what what the difference does it make? this is the only political current in america that gets people out there that will get people to do this and you can say the black lives matter protests but the black lives matter protes because uh uh black liberation has always been. the most easy type of uh domestic uh disturbance to be repressed by the state, the one that they're willing to expend the least effort doing, because it costts them the least politically, how what's going to happen if you piss off black people, if you're a republican, what they don't vote for you anyway, and if you're democrat, what are they going to do, vote for republicans, they have the fire, and yes. It's because they live in a fantasy America, but that means they're powered by something that the left, such as it exists, doesn't have, which is belief, and I don't even mean belief in God, I mean mean belief in success, belief in victory, and of course that all stems for them from a delusion, they believe that they could win because they think this is a different country than it is. because they have just absorbed America's propaganda from a position of relative privilege in America, and most people unless they go to college to learn how to have anxiety are going to respond. to that the same way by accepting it, and only now are we seeing their lived experience colliding with their idea of America, and because the because they believe in America, they think, well this is all fucked up, even if why they think it's fucked up is wrong, even if it's all bundled up with racism and and stupid nationalism, and it is, and xenophobia, it's still generated by a very real connection of their unhappiness to the political order, which many people, including many... real working-class people do not have, and that's because they don't believe in America, because they never did, and when we see these people willing to do this shit, fucking what, naruto run into the fucking capital building, and i i don't think there's any reason to believe that it's going to stop now, uh, and then you look at what the left could put together, it's not good, and i think big part of it is nobody, is going to organize on the left because of the repression of the left over the history and because they're trying to create a self-consciously working class movement, they're not able to like just just go have faith in Trump, they can't just have faith in Trump as like a symbol because they're aware that this has to be a class project and it has to have class goals, but because of that they're also aware of all the obstacles, they're aware that the state has a rait against them, which these people don't think, some of them are coming around to it, and when they fully realize that... they're going to get more radicalized, but that's all to the benefit of the system because those are more uh enemies of the state that we can uh profitably prosecute or threaten people with, and so until the left finds faith in itself, even in the face of the transparent absurdity of that, they'll never be able to be anything effective buse the argument about whether you should be happy or bad sad that the cops killed that lady or you should be happy you should be rooting for Biden to suppress them or not is all meaningless because we have no power over it. the democratic party is going to go is going to govern from a position of austerity and misery, it's going to try to frame it as as uh racial and gender liberation, they're going to do that, the right is going to attempt to coddle. this movement, suborn it and avoid a full confrontation with the state, which they don't want to do, and there's nothing that we can do about any of it, because there's no working class movement to assert a position to the desssert demands uh opposed to this dynamic, if anyone has been listening to... uh age of napoleon uh, he just started talking about the Asian revolution, and he, I was listening to it recently, and it's very good, as is all of Evereth podcasting is, uh, and his description of the political moment, during before the Haitian slave revolt, when there was a big crisis caused by the French revolution back at home, about what to do about the... national assembly and like how to orient the the colony or towards France uh the main battle was between a coalition of uh white slave owners and small white laborers and like middle class people, the the big whites as they were called and the small whites who both wanted to uh rebel against the the king for different reasons, the the the whites, the big whites because they thought it would give them more control over the island and more authority over its economy, specifically its trade so that they could trade to other places more profitably uh and then the small whites because they thought that they could get if they had more of an a say in like the politics of the island as opposed to having no influence over politics in France that they could assert their uh rights uh but they were in a they one thing they agreed on was that they wanted to make the uh government of Haiti spec explicitly uh white supremacist like to enforce a racial code and to maintain like a white political uh a white political monopoly on of power in the in the colony and the other group was the mixed race community the the children of uh of relationships between relationships but between uh white, mostly white slave owners and African slave women, but many of them had been because the french did colonization a little differently. than the Americans did, I think maybe because of the catholicism, uh, in many cases, uh, white slave owners who had uh, black mistresses would marry them and and confer property to the children instead of enslave them, and so you had a class of uh, of mixed race, slave owners and and smallholders, who and and bourgeois, shopkeepers and stuff, who wanted to uh diversify the uh, the racial character of the political ruling class of the of the colony, both of them agreed that slavery was staying where it was, and enslaved hacians were not going anywhere, and the whole battle which was incredibly pitched and saw, saw uh botched insurgencies on both sides and and uh the republican uh the local like ad, the local representative of the French revolutionary government trying to having to like play both sides against the other and it was in in the context of... that that the slaves rose up against both of them, and when I see the republicans and democrats, it's very hard to see it as a battle between, you know, that big white, small white colonial coalition and and the the more progressive, more racially uh, the more racially advanced and and expansive, mixed race uh political movement. as ours, the problem is is that they're where are the slaves? the slaves are not marked by race, they're not marked by conditions of life, they are marked only by their self-identity as consumers. i did the quotation marks for a reason, shut the fuck up, god you fucking people, god, i love being fucking scolded by nit-wits. because I didn't use the right words when I even I did, so that's the challenge, and it's the same challenge no matter what, it's the same challenge if everybody there was a was a fucking uh pipe fitter uh, or if everybody there owned six Subaru dealerships, either way, the challenge is the same, build actual self uh, like... and a lot of the people want to do that through the media and want to do that through memes and want to do that through posting, they see what happened with Trump's people, and they want that for me as that Franklin goes, but you can't have that, that is what it is, because it is reactionary, because it is not responding to material conditions and material. It's responding to a emotional engagement in a spectacle of politics. There is no left-wing version of that, there can't be a left-wing version of that. Now you can have left-wing voice is like uh, braising ideas and concepts, but the organizing is going to be done boringly and tediously at the fucking level of life, at the level of work. or residence, whatever it takes, but it's not going to come through engagement with this spectacle, because everything gets to diffused, and as we said on the show and as I said on the stream the other day, the reason that this is, the reason that these people feel so confident in themselves and the reason they're willing to do this is because they've never been checked, they've always been encouraged, and that's because not even that capitalism wants them to win in any real sense, like have them defeated, defeat global capitalism in a battle. but that they're useful, that kind of political mobilization can always be uh metabolized because it's not a real threat, it it has no character of of organization or coherence or policy behind it, it cannot meaningfully confront capital, it cannot make demands, the only demands these people have is keep Trump president, all right, fine, what if they did that, we got more neoliberalism, more misery, more uh austerity, they wouldn't care, they'd be happy because the people they hate would be mad. and in fact they would blame everyone else for still being around, still existing and and and preventing Trump from doing what he was supposed to do. I'm not on the edge of doom or anything, and anything, this should be liberatory, because if this can't be f here then the fact that everything looks like it's unwinable and unsolvable isn't such a big deal, like it only feels like this saying that this is a a space where where? uh product productive action cannot occur, that feels like it's doomorism to people because they cannot conceive of anything else. the good news though is that if it doesn't matter, well then you can find something, there's something out there now probably, there are fucking prairy fires burning that nobody's aware of because they have not been fucking turned into uh quant they've not been turned into memes, they've not been turned into uh something that be quantified and and and chopped up into some sort of uh like left cultural credit default swap. i don't think i'm going to build a gundom not. I'm blackpiled about this fucking model of engagement, but everyone should be, it's not the only thing in the world, if it is, if it is the only thing in the world, that's the true blackball, because I'm sorry, not a single person who has doubled down on posts as practice, has given me any reason to believe that that would not be sticking your finger up your ass until the world burns. somebody's asking about the socialist rifle club and stuff, if you're meming it, how serious can you be about it? I get that you want to get people on board, but when you're talking about like arming yourself against the state, how seriously can I take somebody who puts that shit on the internet? like that's a very good example like you might very well find that in your life you're gonna have to fucking uh get a gun and do something i'm not saying anyone should do that for the love of god i'm just saying that local conditions might obtain where like okay say like trump losing causes these people to go berserk and the cops are basically just let them tire themselves out but that essentially ends up turning into a number of like local pograms. not saying that's going to happen, but let's say it did, and you felt yourself in a position like where you lived, that it was your responsibility to fucking defend like your neighbors and and and and vulnerable people from them. anything you have to do at that point is not anything you should be fucking posting about and trying to like memify and turn into uh, turn into epic dabs. If anyone's posting about anything, they're not serious about it, everybody posting about a coup and how this is a coup and you need to take it seriously, if they're fucking posting about it all day, they don't really think that, like none of us really think any of the stuff that we think are powering our our political believes. what we mostly just feel is the lastitude, we feel helpless, that's what we really feel, and then we just turn that helplessness into a bunch of different fantasies that we can we can engage with, but like if you think that this is a threat to democracy, i'm sorry, we don't have one of those. "we do not have a democracy, you could argue that during that new will deal deal period that that there was something approaching a a working class articulation of power at the highest levels of government, it was it was coersed, I mean it was subborned and it was uh essentially house broken, and when it was no longer a luxury that the system could afford, it was immediately removed, but it was there, but since then we don't have a fucking democracy? are you fucking kidding me? like thinking, how much, how much emotional force are we supposed to take from the other day's events, from the the the the idea that it was some sort of attack against the sacred institution and sacred uh places? this is the most profane and disgusting place on earth the US fucking capital building. it's like it's like a giant mini St. little St. James mansion. It's just that fucking uh the the weird white and blue greek themed uh dome that he had there, that's just a giant version of that. and the fact that a incoherent jabbering old man because of our fully spectaclized lives where everything that is uh worth caring about is worth caring about to an apocalyptic degree in which more and more that includes politics was able to get people to care this much to die to fucking like have to uh give themselves heart attacks while being tazed uh and to i got to say if you if you don't think this is funny then you are as much of a buzz kill as an SJW. if you don't think somebody going to Washington DC with a gadsden flag that says don't tread on me and then getting killed in a stampede is funny then I'm sorry you you are literally just awoke scold but just with different uh naughty words and different bad uh uh that can't be joked about, but yeah, i can fucking give a shit about the fucking us capital building, the thing that should be, we should be embarrass about is that that's what did it, the thing that everyone should be embarrassed about is that donald fucking trump is what got people to do that, and yes, the fact that it's donald trump is why they were allowed to do it, but uh, like there's going to have to be some serious. and television, but a lot of it is that they aren't neurotic, it's a lot of it is that they did not learn that politics have to be perfect in order to be actionable, that you have to be able to explain everything about everything you believe in order to act on it, which is a paralysis i think that infects the left and i know infects me, tell me if i'm wrong, like i can't act unless i know that every action i'm doing is correct, and the fact that trump is just spectacle and and and emotional. allows that makes crossing that bridge much easier, getting to the leap of faith, the left it's harder because so much of it is intellectual, because so little of it is actually connected to uh like a struggle for survival, but that's going to have to happen, people are going to have to convince themselves at a deeper level and even allow themselves to think, i might not even be right about this, this might not be the right case, there might be somebody online who might call this cringe, who might say: that I'm doing liberalism or that I'm doing uh anarchism or that I'm doing tankyism or that I'm doing whatever the fuck, I might, I might be wrong, I might eat shit at this, I might get laughed at, and that has to be okay, because otherwise people give up, people give up, look what happened in last summer, people thought they had the revolution in their hands for a minute, some of them did anyway, and it ended up being a giant chess match, taking down statues, because that was the... only buse the symbolic realm is the only area where you could see a plausible uh uh movement forward and one of the things that makes it easier to do that like if it's a question of like trump should stay at office that's a great binary that's wonderful and the left doesn't have any. like that, i mean there i mean, i keep saying the left, there is no left, but there is no left articulation of that that can be summed up in such a binary and time dependent and and space dependent question as will you be inaugurating a new president, but my hope is that the democratic party, which is looking like it's on the road towards total uh, total self abnegation, like the fact, i mean i don't honestly care if they fucking try to uh to impeach trump, i think i think making that the thing everyone should care about is dumb, honestly like hey how about try to ring the dinner bell a little bit, especially that you got joe fucking mansion saying no to the $2,00 checks, maybe like circle the the wagons around an actual helpful thing the people could you know think feel good about as opposed to just advertising your powerlessness. because they're not going to vote to impeach him, and you will be reminded again, oh yes, all of these norms are just agreed upon manners and real force can decide these contests and if it does, you don't have it. any, you don't have any, because well over a a half the guys whose job it is to come in the room and clear it, half the time, half the guys whose job it is to carry a gun into a room and decide who should be there, uh, at least somewhat agree with this, and are of no commitment to the democratic project as you represent it, no matter how many times you talk about how desacralizing and and and and shameful everything is. "that is a that's that is a balance of power where the democrats essentially exist at the sufferance of the republicans because their existence keeps everything moving, keeping the democrats around allows them allows rule to be carried out, because we need that illusion of democratic give and take in order to allow all the ill humors of capitalism to be vented properly, but if you make it an existential question and like these people saying we're going to throw them all, we're gonna" all in jail, we're going to throw all the seditious uh members of house into jail and we're going to throw Trump in jail. yeah, right, you know what would happen if that happened, or at least you know what you're afraid would happen, which is all that matters. all you need is the fear, and the reason they have the fear is that they know that they could not marshal the same forces and coordinate them the same way, because of the hostility to the of the police state, to those people, to their disorganization, to the lack of... the democratic party representing anything beyond just a a a rejection of the republican party. but what we're going to see from the democrats is going to be us uh a a a a an attempt to do essentially like bushism like these guys are trying to talk about this as 911 is bad as 911 they wanted. be their 911, that's the point of this, this is going to be the democrats 9/11, that they get to wave the bloody shirt at the republicans, which honestly could help them, because looking at the polls, this is not a popular thing that happened, and even though there's all these like um, well manicured Jerry Mandering structures that allow the republicans to hold power, I do not think that the uh wealthy writer, wealthy older white people. voted in the democrats are liking any of this, and a lot of them voted in split tickets for democrat for republicans might start punishing republicans. now just in the same way, all these, but the thing is all these fucking guys in the house, live in Jerry Mander Republican districts, they can't go against Trump, because they will be gone by the end of business day. and so they're going to get to wave the bloody shirt and use it as an excuse for uh a democratic application of police state uh technology and surveillance and incarceration because neoliberalism has finally come for the whites, i mean it came for the poor whites a long time ago, but it finally came for the boats, it came for the people who have had a little chunk of that post-war magic and now it's shrinking away. and it's this is not negotiable shit and their uh political movement is too inarticulate to to challenge capitalism realistically, it will be subborned, it will be uh reduced, it will be recuperated, and that which cannot be will be repressed, that's the fucking playbook, and the republicans, oh boy, I mean, they're at this point, it's clear they will never, they will never accept the... of a close election to go against them again and that means every election will essentially be a tip ball and that helps the democrats too though, because if it's close enough and they lose it, it's just Bush versus Gore again, everything's kept going, everybody kept getting paid, it didn't break anything, the system maintain itself, you just like slowly, and then the democrats are regional party, maybe like run New York and California, I mean somebody asked why it's bad to call it terrorism, i think i'm articulating it right now, like we already tried this with one form of terrorism, which was a response to American bipartisan policy, which the proper response to would have been to minimize the threat and not treat it like the end of the world, but instead we maximize the threat, treated it like the end of the world, specifically treated it as an excuse to shit all over civil liberties domestically and carry out a war overseas, now the war is coming home in every sense, the war is coming home and that means that we're going to have to intensify our state apparatus of technological control, which we're having instead of fascism, and that will now start have to fall. having to fall on the whites, because everybody's going into the wood shipper and some of you will get lucky and get shit out into the capitalist side, but the the mass majority of you are going to come out, your kids are going to come out, peasants and that's you do not have where with all the ability to challenge that, they will shit all over you, we're getting shit out. I mean China, yeah, that's the model, but at least there's some sort of efficiency there, my god, because they don't have to pretend that they're a fucking democracy, because they don't have to offer their stupid uh, like special dispensations for their uh, their their colliky white middle class, everybody is equally uh with the program. and here's the important part too, people say yes okay, but shouldn't we treat this seriously, when has the US government shown itself able to uh defeat terrorism with its uh, with its control of of beyond throwing people a jail, beyond creating greater degrees of alienation from the people you're supposed to be deradicalizing, when is it ever helped? so saying no, this time we're going to do it right, because it's going to be against the right people, even if it did, obviously it won't, it will be used riberally against uh all kinds of left wing uh movements, no question, indigenous, we all know that, but even if it was laser focused on these these white reaccionaries, it would still would be bad. Denazification worked, they just turned West Germany over to the nazis, that's how they denazified German, that's that's how they denocified West Germany, they just let them stay in charge and gave everybody some a fucking uh chocolate uh subsidy, but if you're going to talk about like we need to confront these people, we need like a real confrontation with uh with like the forces of fascism in this. country, I ask simply, okay, you and who, and if you're if you think that's necessary, and we're and and you consider how far we are from it, if you think posting there is effective, then you are really just jerking yourself off, they banned uh, they banned linnwood from from parlor, damn, that's how you no shit's serious. I don't know about what third party will emerge, but I do that the democrats are, they will be the death of us, because they are in a position where they are the only force standing against just full reactionary ganglian rule. but they represent no popular uh mobilizable uh civic uh uh order or or organ or anything, they represent no one, they're just fully a brand. Trump has transcendent branhood, Trump is now essentially in his ability to get people to fucking act on his behalf religious, and the democrats have nothing, they have transactions, they have virtue signaling, that's it, that means that they cannot. and that why that's why they cannot really force the confrontation here, even though everyone's like, wow, they really need to get Trump out of there before he just calls for another you know invasion of Washington, uh, they know that they don't have the fucking horses for it, they don't have the horses for it, so something's going to have to fill that gap, but I don't know what it is, the moving for people's party, all the stuff I've seen from that makes it look incredibly online to me, which as you know I am highly allergic to, so we'll see, but it's certainly whatever it is, it's going to have to emerge from actual experiences of struggle, of experiences of conflict on behalf of of people themselves, as workers, as residents, as as people live in a place and want some fucking dignity, that's what's going to do it. all right, uh, see you chickens later.
