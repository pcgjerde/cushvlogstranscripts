 It's time to soy face folks, we're soy facing, are you guys on? Let me check, I always got to check the twitch to make sure you're streaming correctly. It looks like it's time, looks like it's happening, oh there we go, hi everybody, I'm in my name uh my living room because it is kind of crummy out, little little cold, uh, a little chily, hanging out on the couch, I'm I'm soying it up on the couch, trying to keep my knees out of you, I don't want to distract everyone with my erotic energies, I don't ever going to get all riled up when they see my scabbed nobby toddler ass knees. this is actually not a hot couch at all, it's a very comfortable uh cool couch. uh, it's not very big but uh gets the job done. so today I figured we were going to take the take the uh pedal off the metal a little bit and just groove, just going to have a groovy chat sesh, no real uh agenda today. uh, yeah, I said... yesterday if anyone's got any cool uh questions about history or maybe popular culture we could chop them up a little bit trying to stay uh trying to stay grounded trying to knock that wood oh this is a better angle anyway perfectly kiss me gaming uh is grilling if you don't if the if gaming is grilling if you don't get angry while you're doing it i guess uh or bored uh yeah and cuz think about it, like if you're gaming, if you're not bored, you're emotionally invested to a degree of anger, right? uh, if you're just zoned out, that can be good, but you should be building some sort of skill set is the idea, you should be actually producing something, uh, that's the whole point, uh, presumably, I mean, I think gaming could like kind of give you habits of mind, but you're going to have to actually build something, you're going to have to contribute to the world. even if it's just at the thing of scrimsaw or like carving a little wooden man at at first, whatever it is, i don't know, i don't know what the kids do, whatever it is, it has to be three-dimensional, and then eventually you can get so good at like putting uh, putting like meaning into action, that you can go back to gaming and it can be part of your practice, but the problem at the beginning is it's too frictionless, gaming is too frictionless, it's just like uh, it's just like yelling on the internet, it's friction. there has to be friction uh and that and i mean that in a literal sense like an item like crafting an item or preparing an item anything but yeah so if you guys have any let's let's chop it up on some uh on some fun history history and and uh history stuff and and whatnot i got to find out those little why those little guys exist, i'm assuming those microstates all exist because somebody made some blood oath to the pope in the middle ages or something where they like decided to to uh hide the holy grail i don't know i don't know enough i don't know enough about art to say uh what my favorite painter is uh I have to think about it. I was one of those Dorics in high school whose favorite panting was Nighthawks because I didn't, I didn't have any friends. Uh, I... people, the i would like to talk a little bit about this, the 1619 project thing, i will admit that i haven't read it, so i'm not going to talk about what it specifically says, i will just make an if than statement, if the conclusions of that or if the drive and and point of the 1961 project are to claim that the conditions of American capitalism, in the present moment are inextricable. to uh racism at the point of leverage uh then I don't think that that's very helpful and I think it's wrong and explains why it got you know all these awards from uh the ford foundation and you know corporate America because if the if the point you're trying to make is that racism and capitalism are inextricably linked at the point of fusion then each one is as fixable as the other right? the degree to which you fight defeat racism a concept that doesn't have a material form is the degree to which you defeat capitalism but doesn't work, because racism is in the the the ideal realm, you can only fight the things that generate racism, which are material uh, material um, like significant, concentrated, racially coded material distribution disadvantages, that's the only way that you reduce the racism and they are, they are inextricably bound, they are like a DNA helix, but one came first, one was generative. one is built on top, which and one can be moved, and that's always the case with any of these issues, and the one that can be moved is capital, because it's actually material and you can move it, you cannot move racism because it doesn't exist anywhere but in the minds of men and women and in the refied structures that they create, so you have to unreify the structures to get rid of the feelings, so all i will say about 9 16 is if that's the point it's making, and a lot of people seem to think it is, if they are right, then I got to give it the old, kush bomb thumbs down. Now, of course, it's hard to make that argument, because all the people who hate it the most are conservatives, who just hate it because it implies America isn't good, as this as though that were a concept that made sense in the first place, a country being good, that's not possible, it's it's it's it's a... quality that can not be imbued on that level of definition, any more than a channel changer, it can be good or bad. structures are made up of people, but they aren't people, so they should not be judged morally, and so that's why they hate it, it's like, no, you're getting rid of my beautiful myth of America, and of course, the beauty of that is, if America's perfect or or good, and uh, there's this uh, concentrated disadvantage and resources for black people, then i guess it's not the fault of the country, is it? because a good country wouldn't let that happen. I wonder whose fault it is. It's literally, that's also deflecting from the material world. Both of them are richicheing backwards, but like I said, I don't know if that's what's in there. I have to say, the fact that the uh, one of the authors of the thing is on. twitter right now doing like uh meltdown threads about 10,000 follower uh like semi-anonymous accounts from people who aren't even check marked that indicates like I've said before a lack of confidence in the foundations of your intellectual underpinning you should not be doing that if you really believe in what you're saying I mean if you think that there's uh if somebody is being disingenuous you can point out a line of reasoning but like that kind of dragging indicates that at a certain point you're not really um you're not really sure of what you're you're not really sure what you're saying is right so people are asking me specific stuff and i have no idea i just know that that there is a that things can be intert intervined at the basic level but there's still a causal relationship between the two there's a base and superstructured relationship even if they're fused the only thing that breaks them is the change of material. conditions, no matter what, now that material condition change might because might be come because things change enough in the firmament to push them, but that's always started with the material change, always cuz like it seems like a lot of these people who want to incorporate you know the new lang the new uh the new scholarship on American slavery, the challenges the notion that it was somehow in conflict with capitalism. um, they want to take that as an excuse to reify racism into a social, material force, which it will never be, and that confuses things and makes it harder to fight against the cause of racism. Eric Fohner's book is good, I've heard, yeah, shallby foot, the guys, he was a hell of a writer. has there ever been an example. of a social of a government stopping or preventing a socialist revolution without implementing some of their policies, i can't i mean countries have revolutions when the when the when the symmetry between providing needs for the people uh and being like perceived as the legitimate source of those needs become completely friction completely broken and so... Socialist revolution is just pressure of material disconent. Material discontent must be addressed, and you can call it a social, it could be socialist reforms, but it will be addressed through collapse and war, which reduce the amount of capital and therefore redistributed or through revolutionary, or through revolution or through steady and uh steady and slow reforms. uh, the global south is the mirror image of the global north in a lot of ways and that they are materially disadvantaged to such an extent that they can't grow the sort of mobilized uh uh base of people who have enough alienated uh leisure time. to effectively uh push against capitalism, the same way we have an issufficient number of people can connect that number of people or we have an insufficient mechanism for connecting those people to everyone else. i think people like to the degree that insights about superstructure have been taken by people of bad faith and people who are kind of mystified by being on the internet for too long uh that because that that superstructure comes first, and that's wrong, and so people get angry at gramshi because they blame him for everyone taking his uh, emphasis on simpr structure and turning it around, but it's not necessarily his fault, it's just that we now live in a symbolically rich era of of of spectacle and pseudo uh ritualization of politics, and so it's very easy to take the insight of Grampshi and just immediately. frictionlessly move over to be like, oh that means the superstructure comes first, we should be arguing on the plane of ideas, and that's where the real thing is, no, and we should be arguing about culture, and marvel movies do change the world, no no, no, he was describing a reality, now you're living in it, that's whatever happens, that's the nightmare of history that was caught in, the dead, the history of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living, what that means is that we are all living. in the in the dreams and ideas of of dead generations, so like RAMSshi observes the reality of superstructure, the situation changes, things shift, now we live in a in a society where the economy has become so abstracted into simples and that means that the culture has become so abstracted into symbols that now we have every reason to believe and we have to push against the presumption that politics is symbolic, and so we put on that condition, but it's he's not his fault, he just pointed it out, we're living in his nightmare, the respect economy is as strong as ever, thank god, even in the even in the horrors of the corona mailstrom, the respect economy stays strong, i still respect you guys, you respect me, the respect economy, the flow continues, that we don't need any kind of uh stimulus over here. It's a pull market, well respect from belfast, everyone's favorite accent, that's great, oh that just sounded scottish, terrible, sorry, awful, I realize now I've been terrible at these the whole time, you guys were all right, I sucked, uh, they're still kind of funny sometimes, but yeah, no, terrible at accents, it was absolutely uh, self. illusion that i thought i was doing well, is come town and kahoots with sam kide to bring naziism into America? i highly doubt it, that's as much as i could say about any uh anything outside of myself, i highly doubt it, oh right yeah everyone loves, well i don't know which accent you mean, you mean the real one? i think that's why i like doing accents even though i'm terrible. is because I think I have one of the least um appealing American accents, the high nasal twang of the upper mid-west, just everything. push through the top of the nose, awful uh, the up there episode i recorded on Sunday night and it should be coming out on Thursday, uh, I would say that the Byzantines are a good comparison for us, slow, steady decline uh in the face of uh of uh expanding regional competition. It gets close, my accent gets close to the Canadian accent, but because we're not all scottish, we never got the about bullshit, unlike 90% of anglo-Canadians, fucking mackintire ass country, just a plaid ass country, just a bunch of highlanders playing hockey. When am I going to game? I'm not sure. Maybe we can get the gaming rate going in the office and if we can, I'll do that, but I really don't have the uh capability in my place to do gaming at all. I don't have a rig, I don't have a system. I don't have, I don't even have a a lap thing, and we have a really great gaming rig in the office. I just really want to play, but it's going to be up to the everyone else because I don't know the specs uh to set it up. I don't know what I'm gonna play, I've said that I thought the katamari dimasi would be a good starting point, because a game that is uh uh low challenge level so they can be immersive without becoming upsetting uh allowing for conversation and you know I don't want to just like get too fixated I've heard of Duncan Trussel I've heard he's good I've never I don't listen to his podcast or anything. oh we got to somebody's asking about the potatoes, i love talking about the potatoes, i love talking about the pan potatoes, if the peasants are as marks described a sacr of potatoes, how do you explain the hundreds of peasant revolts throughout history? well, it's not the act of the revolt, it's the it's the it's the goal of the revolt, i mean they've been... revolts in all social organs, there's been revolts every strata of social domination in every organized society in history, revolts are only meaningful if they are effective, they're only effective to which they're coordinated, they're only coordinated to the degree to which they represent a singular will, which is the a class acting for itself on its own behalf, and pesant revolts tended not to operate that way, they were because of pesant life, highly regionalized. and they were usually based on the idea of complaining to the king about the uh excesses of local uh lords or vice versa. they were appealing to an authority that they had an inherent uh belief it. if they if they were bad lords or a bad king they needed to be replaced by good lords and a good king. that is not a class that can overthrow a a uh a class mode of production. so that's the... difference because when they get together they're just a bunch of people who are pissed off at something, they are not people are pissed off at specific exploiters of their labor because it's been because it isn't exploited directly and more importantly they don't communicate together a common experience and like present revolts are essentially pre-quakes of the crisis that are going to break down feudalism or any other social order they're like you have to friction like you can kind it's like this isn't this isn't causally true but it is descriptively true that you can take the a significant friction a breakpoint in history and you can see the ripples go forward and backward and so peasant society revolts are progressive forces and that they're bringing contradictions to the top, but they will not be the basis for a new order that will be uh anything other than transitional. so that's that's the argument there, i mean mawiism in the United States is hilarious because we are of course repesantized, we are we we've been turned into peasants as i've said but instead of being potatoes in a sack we are now uh the pringless because we are now essentially symbolized peasants we've been run through the capitalist machine spit out the other end as as uh as but now we have been socially isolated so that we can we can't form the social bonds that make peasant organization possible because what what the class process was according to Marx was a dynamo whereby the the the notion of a social self that the peasant class has is pulled by the need for new sustenance to the cities that turns the people in the cities who work in industry uh into... people who are aware of class, become a class, a class project and then take over uh, because they're trying to impress that notion of a social self onto a capitalist system that doesn't allow for a social self, they're trying to reassert those values, but now we're so far from the present world, we got pressed through the uh the mandalin of uh of you know settler colonialism and capitalism. now we are physically spread so that we don't have a social baseline to try to get back to through organization, we we might want, we might say we want medicare for all, we might say we want um to end cesta fosta, we might say that we want uh to um uh you know break up the banks or or or nationalize amazon, but to what social ends, we don't have social ends because our social lives are so atomized we can only think in terms of capitalist uh uh capitalist value systems, capitalist reward systems and so something has to intervene with this dynamic for it to change. medieval catholic heresy? oh, there's a lot of good ones, i'm trying to think, the cattars are obviously really fun, everyone loves the cathars, i like the lawlards. just a bunch of guys lolly gagging around and you got to love those hussides buse they were fucking jeez those guys fought yon huss got his ass kicked but they were but his followers like no fuck you we're gonna keep fighting all heres in the middle era are catholic heresies all here before the... establishment of protestantism is catholic heresy, what else is it? is not having space for spiritual life, a material agreevance? yes it is, because you cannot have a spiritual life and you unless you have enough unaalienated time to develop one, and what this capitalist system is doing now, the late capitalist like... late stage uh eating the bone, sucking the bone out of the marrow, stealing the copper wiring stage is doing to everyone at every level is they are grinding out unalienated time from their lives, like fucking toothpaste out of a tube at different rates and to diff in a different people, so like right now as i said we have the people inside and the people outside, the people inside are having alienated time out the waz where they'... have nothing to do but worry about stuff that's out of their control and try to distract themselves with zoom meetings and fucking netflix and clapping and making banners or whatever people on the outside their alien their time is so alienated by the need to be working that they have no time to be able to be to work towards self in any way in it like any concordance of self with your moment in time and space of course so yes every spiritual. is a material grievance and you have to harness whatever degree combination of things you can to alleviate this the material basis for it. i'm i'm calm dude, calmer than you are. the right work weak varies depending on how alienating the labor is. there is no single one. in an ideal social order, people would work to the degree that it was rewarding to them, and you might say, oh, that sounds. everyone's going to loll around, no they're not, not if they are matched to a task that fits them, everyone has some combination of abilities and self motivation, whatever you want to call it, to look at a task and complete it without it feeling like too much work, some tasks have high high tolerances for that, you know, that's why people are willing to eat shit to go to academia because the their labor time is almost. almost entirely unalienated because they want to talk about literature or whatever the fuck. shitty jobs, those are wildly alienating jobs, because even though you could hypothetically find pleasure in cleaning a toilet or... or something like that, it's hard, what that means is you could do it, rewardingly for less time, so a shitty job you should do for less of your time, but more people, you might say, yeah, but what, but more people can do that, more people together at a job that is um, that is not that is difficult to find rewarding, could make that job easy and complete it, while jobs that are are more rewarding uh in other ways so that you could do them longer without becoming annoyed with the task, you would have longer work weeks, and the funny thing is it's like that's the social, that's the central insight of like those cookie like 20th century like social credit people, the recognition that not all labor is the same, not all activities are the same uh and where they should not be renumerated in the same forms uh, because like alienated labor that sucks physically, it takes a lot of money to make that worthwhile, and just so happens to be the work that is rewarded the least uh materially, that is a signal mismatch, and like those goofy social credit people who like took over Alberta in the 30s, I guess with their green shirts, they recognize that, but the problem is they didn't have. other part of the puzzle and so they ended up being cranks and that's what cranks really are, like every crank movement is somebody who gets some truthful, real fucked up thing about the social order that needs to be unkinked, but they get fixated and they can't see the forest for the trees, like that's every social crank from Lisander Sponer to um uh to Henry George, to the to the silver shirts. Oh somebody found a Zanix while cleaning their room, see the universe rewards, is there any uh, somebody saying, is it better to have a weak Biden as president than Trump to fight them? I don't know, first of all, I don't know how we're going to fight them, that's still to be determined, secondly, I don't know if you're fighting them at that point, I feel like at this point, I mean they're they've thrown their hands up, did you guys see the single most amazing video of the Trump presidency in my opinion, the one that beats the hamburgers by a factor of a billion, he's a honeywell plant pumping out n95's and some guy, some bald security guy or like executive, total like a guy looks like one of his funkies, he look like Keith shiller is holding up this mask and he's he's like explaining just how wonderful it is, and Trump is standing next to them looking about 500 pounds, he looks like a refrigerator in a fucking Joseph a bank suit and he's just looking worse than he's ever did, he almost you can see the lines in the split spray tan, and he's just like pretending to paying attention this guy and pointing at it, like check out this guy, and over the speaker is blaring the guns and roses cover of live and let die, it's one of those sublime moments where you realize the totality of the moment you live in, like you it's a crystalization of every every single factor that has brought us here and it's going to bring us into the future, uh, they've given up on running anything or even pretending that they have the ability to stop people. from dying like Trump for his whole presidency, it's like I'm the guy protects America, I make America, look at you, America's great and because of me, now even he knows it's not going to happen, at some level he's like, yeah, ah, you, you expect us to be able to solve anything, no, I was there to rile you up, one way or the other, I was able to keep your orgon occupied by loving or hating me, while the actual looting of the nation went on underneath my feet, so that means that whichever one of these is going to win, like the forces that are controlling them are more willing than ever to just display their power nakedly and give up the fig leaf of democratic legitimacy, and the the gamble they're going to be making is that our social atomization has reached a tipping point they can't be recovered from, regardless of whether material conditions get terrible enough, regardless of how much they give up, even attempting to uh channel our actual concerns, and the thing is is that that is a... that is a thing like at some point we will reach a break whereby after that we won't be able to assert any kind of opposition. effective opposition to capital, that will happen, if things don't change, the current trajectory, that will happen, whether we have reach that point or not, i don't know, and the only way we're going to know is retroactively when the next big break comes, how we respond to it will answer the question, and so our tasks, as little grill pillars or whatever we're doing is to be as ready for that moment as possible when it comes to have developed a daily practice that's as close to the root of responding to that challenge when it appears. what should an artist be doing to bring about socialism? finding out a way to connect their their art or their abilities, whatever they have. i should never, i would never say stop doing art even though... the superstructure is meaningless, because the fact is, you're going to try, what's going to realistically happen is you're going to say, art's not important now, you're going to try something to do something else that you're not as good at and you're going to get frustrated and stop, you should stay in concordance with your like with where you are, you should challenge yourself though, and try to bring your art in alignment with your values to such a degree that you feel the least amount of conflict between them, and that's not going to be a huge. break, it's a gradual progress process that over time leads to big breaks, which is the way that all history works, from the micro to the macro, but you should, but you need to be doing, you need to be recognizing whether your art is having an effect, like if you draw spirograph doodles for example, or make really stupid cheesy uh socialism for the win buttons or pins for example, and you post them online and say look at the little drawing I did and you get two likes, one of them from your mom, even if that makes you feel good, you probably need to add a little grit in there, you need a little throw a little grit into the works to see what maybe you could be doing that's a little more effective, a little more uh reaches people a little more deeply, but at every level you need you start with evaluating what you actually like and then seeing how far you can make that how much you can grind uh that pleasure against the wheatstone of like gruling attention to detail. yeah, so like the only you have to be at this point i don't, i don't think you're a serious analysis of the... situation if you have not embraced the whole notion that we are in a terminal crisis uh, but the problem is is that a lot of people don't want to say that because they think it's going to give people an excuse to stop trying, and it will, like all the black bill shit is an excuse for people to give up, and what that just means is give up on ever even trying to be happy with themselves, on ever trying to be anything other than miserable every moment of their life until they die, that is what they have given up, and they want an excuse to do that because they don't know any other way to be. and anything that says there's no alternative is giving them excuses. just because America has entered a decline phase, does not mean as I said the other day, that that decline has to be fatally terminal to all institutions and all people. It'll be fatal to some combination of institutions and people, but it could be arrested and redirected into different point paths at any point. It can be intervened with by people acting together. So there is no. black pill no matter how much you might acknowledge the situation being in a in a crisis moment and so that's a thing that inhibits like that's a perfect example that like a mere fact that inhibits uh our understanding of the world because some people are going to use it in bad faith bad faith to others and bad faith to themselves really and then you feel the need to deny that fate that fact no we're not in the decline because you don't want to give it in to those bad faith actors, but i'm coming around to the idea that you can only ever defeat bad faith with good faith over time, not in a given moment, you might get owned, you might get owned by somebody who buys your logics you into oblivion, you might lose an argument in some sense that more people think you were wrong than right, but over time you will develop the belief in yourself to act with full concentration and conviction. "the military aggression question is a good one, if America maintains its solvency as a country, and this depression is his bad as it looks it might be uh and uh there is that much material sudden deprivation as there appears to already be uh oh boy that's pressure is going to have to go somewhere it's we're either going to have to go towards our government for letting it happen or some other thing and uh the chinese are right there i mean we're totally intertvined with them politically and economically but logically uh, but man, and they and all of the rare earth metals we use for our missile systems come from them, half of our high-tech, but the European powers of 1914 were uh, were economically interdependent too, i don't know, it depends on, it depends on the reaction of the government, it becomes on the degree to which they are, there is a force requiring capital to redistribute, if we distributes enough, that force will be alleviated and and we won't have to go to war with China, or like Iran is a proxy for China, but if that if there is, if there is sudden massive deprivation of material conditions in this country, there will either be a civil war when we turn that frustration on each other, or a war with another country, that is, those are the only three options on the table, there's no third, there's no third option, is either dramatic redistribution of resources downward or some break up of the of the political symbolic order at the at the level of the nation state, or we all direct that energy on some foreign country, and i think that the set that the civil war is the least likely because of just how how disperate disperate we are, how uh frankly physically unhealthy we are, we're not in a situation where any of us, i mean my god people are losing their shit because they have to have their uh buffalo wild wings delivered instead of going in to the place to watch uh eat them in person, how are they gonna handle not having any buffalo wild wings at all? you know it's funny like dual power, i have kind of scorned dual power notions because it feels so uh uh early to be talking that way uh considering you know the array of power going against us and to call any kind of mutual aid that usually gets tucked away in the category of charity uh as anything other than that i think is could be like categorically unuseful but i'm starting to think that anything that privileges action on the ground is worth supporting, even if you might think it's going to be misdirected, i think people got to do what they think is right as long as it's so like electoralists stop getting mad at dual power people and let them do their dual power, dual powerers though, stop yelling at electoralists and calling them suckdems, mutual laying down of arms and do the thing that you think is right because you think it's right, not because you want other people to think that you're the most left or you're the most correctly left. anything that gets you working in the world is worth supporting, now that means working in the world, that like a lot of people think that to mean like demonstrations, no, demonstrations are just the first level of symbolic politics and it's so fair, it's like better, like if it's if it's just the comparison, if the comparison is just the internet in a demonstration, demonstration. is better just because it's less abstract and it requires more of your attention and focus, but it's still inferior to anything else, it's still inferior to anything that's actually constructive. that's why you know things like extinction, rebellion are not only dead ends, they're probably entirely uh government controlled, like there's absolute reason to be totally concerned about like demonstration politics as a model during a crisis like this. but anything else that's like getting things to people and building connections is worth trying just so you're a better position when material conditions change. i read a bunch of derekson when i was in uh when i was in like college and he blew my mind uh yeah no i read i read i read of a couple of his books and it's like goddamn this is uh uh stringent and the thing is that he's right about a lot, he's right about capitalism, like the thing that Derick Jenson writes uh uh assumes is that the current model will just will collapse and lead to a new dark age. and that's true, and it's like there's no like, oh, yes, but technology will intervene, right, but technology will also make things more savage, and it will it will, it will allow socially unstable, non-viable arrangements to continue beyond their natural life cycle, but he's also you know of the belief that that that would be preferable to stay there in some sort of barbaric situation, and that's not sustainable, like the ann prim thing, no. It's just it's it's not just that it's uh wrong to seek it, it's not going to happen, people will get annoyed, the human brain will will push against its barriers uh of ability to create its own environment, so I mean that's one what that is in human nature, and the way we know is that there's a fucking society and they keep be building them, like everything else like they tell tell you is human nature, that's all horse shit, it's imprinted, but uh, but having a having the progress, the progressive nature. is and you're building on the buildings that were around when you were there, you're building in the context of that of that which you existed when you were there, means that unless you're going to do some sort of ritualistic um communal bringdown, and maybe you could imprint that at the social level where you like a butlarian jihad, uh, you're fucked. but i mean if you had a wide if you like if you got enough people to believe at the level of spiritual that they should not build that they should not uh you know go beyond a certain level of development that would be great, that'd be fine, if it was if it was stable at that level, that would be fine, like a lot of systems are like that, that's why there are still undiscovered tribes. in the Amazon because they have a social homeostasis, the problem is that's not everybody, so that's why it wouldn't work, because you would not be able to to to keep that, because you can say all right, everybody at this level of social order, we all have deeply embedded symbolic belief that we can't uh build stuff, but over time even with that things are going to change, you're going to have to move ground. you're going to have to give up one well and build a new one, and something's going to develop, and time and space are both real and they're going to imprint on on humans, so uh, might as well seek to synthesize technology at a level that can maintain a setty state at the highest point, because it contains every energy in the system, rather than at a low point, which will inevitably lead to instability, the accumulation somewhere else, and the whole thing explodes again. see people are asking about like if a job is useful practice if doing access useful practice at that category no or nothing is if you do it's all about uh that question can't be answered it's whether you're doing it with the right mind now that doesn't apply to everything like if you're working for the bush white trump white house or fucking CIA or uh Monsanto there's no ethical way to be doing what you you're doing, you know, but like at a certain level of abstraction, you can say that about everything is, you can say everything is evil, but you get to a point where good outways evil, like yeah, you are, by by being a college professor, you are perpetuating a lot of bad systems, but you could, if you apply yourself with whole harmony of spirit to the job, you could do more good than harm, that's impossible at a job like uh working at a investment banker or working uh for the FBI, working in any system of like direct control of corporate power, because if you concentrate yourself on the job to the best of your abilities, you're doing more evil, you're just making the evil doubled of working the job, so see if the job you have can possibly be positive in its contribution and then work towards that, so that answer. is the answer of like canopy praxis is is it possible to have praxis there in that in it given its position in the capital structure and can you get it out of it and those are questions that can't be answered by me. Uh, what are the odds of an American NDL uh NDP or labor party uh? I mean it depends on how bad, it depends on how bad things get, um, if Biden wins, I think all that energy, it goes to some sort of weird hair and folk republican party, the big nightmare everyone's been scared of, I think that's a real fear and I think it's more likely if Biden wins, because unless we're able, unless people are able to make them give us enough to prevent a real crisis. um, the republicans are going to respond the only way they can, if Trump wins, yeah, I think, I think the the democratic party splinters in a significant fashion, once again, not sure, that's still far away, um, and things will intervene to change the dynamic, but that's again, if it's not changing, uh, a Trump win, I think leads more likely to a splintered democratic party, a a Biden win, more likely. to a uh a repolarized uh uh realigned republican party, which is worse, much worse. I mean, if you feel like your job is worthless, then you shouldn't do it if you have the freedom not to. I mean, if you have to do it because that you don't have alternatives, and i that's awful and that's the nightmare that we're all trying to avoid and so many of us are caught in uh and you know you should try your best to take the time you have that's free and like put it to use so that you can counterbalance the feeling of uselessness you have in your job um but if you if but i think that doing that will make give you a better idea of what you could be doing elsewhere and that could be a blue jaller job if you have a white coller one and the thing is you have to shed the inherent belief that that job is better because it's in an office, because I mean there are probably a lot of people who are working office jobs that they would like less than blue collar jobs that they're doing because they think there's a social stigma to working with their hands, and that shouldn't be, just as there are people in blue color jobs who didn't have the educational access to get white color jobs that they would find more satisfying than what they're doing. a colonial mindset, wow, protesting the DNC, uh, yes, absolutely, I mean, what they did is worth protesting, uh, and protesting, I know I just said protesting is symbolic politics, but so is a political party, in a real sense. uh and so is a political uh convention, i mean especially a convention, my god that is the most symbolic thing, they don't even have to have them because it's all settled, they've become pure spectacle, so of course you know contribute to the spectacle in any way you want, i don't think that's anything wrong with that, and if it's directed as at the democratic party, i think that will be good, because they have to be delegitimized to against the coming crackup, because they are either going to lose to Trump for two straight elections, which will cause huge, huge crisis for them. I really think that's going to happen, unless everything gets better and we're not in the hell uh, second term of you know great depression and under under the damn cheeto and chief, no, that's going to cause complete breaks. um, or Biden's going to preside over a austerity, he's going to be the bruning of America, uh, not Matt, uh, the general. chancellor who oversaw uh the austerity that led to the nazi's taking power, either way they need to be delegitimized for their future uh delegitimization that they're going to be undertaking. i mean, i i you know why Bernie dropped out, i know that it's good to kind of let this stuff go, and uh, i i think people freak getting really excited. about Bernie being put back on the ballot in New York, it's a little sad, it's like, just give me this one thing, and it's like, that's all you're getting though, and that's pretty, it's it should be sad, it should be a sad moment, uh, but I think we got to like move past Bernie, because he's his he's served his purpose, he he has marshalled certain forces, he has gotten people arrayed along a certain politics and now it's them to move forward, it's on us to take up, Bernie's got to watch the skies. while we watch the neighborhood uh, but I think that realistically the reason he dropped out is that they were going to keep killing people at primaries, I think they were going to just be like, we're going to keep killing people at these primaries until you drop out. and it's like we're not going to let you win, and he started to feel personally responsible, like I'm going to get these people killed by keep by staying in, because that's what the democrats think, like you might think, how could these monsters allow this to happen, they blame Bernie, you can bring show them all the dead uh poll workers from Illinoy and Florida and Arizona and say how did you let this happen, and they'd say why didn't Bernie drop out, why did he make us do that, and they would have said that about all of it, that's the that's the mind authoritarian mindset, the authoritarians never take it. any credit for any violence they do because it's the fault of the victim or someone else. why did you make us do that? it's never never their fault. so bernie's just like, i don't want to be, i don't want to be up at night thinking about people dying because i i stayed in the race, and that makes him a mench, and i think he is a mench, but that doesn't mean that we should be unrealistic about where we are visa v his chances of being president. All right, if someone's a neat on quarantine, what kind of job this should they do? uh, I'd say start at something, start at whatever you think you could do, and but just shed of like ambition, because that's how you defeat yourself, it's like, well, something that you could get a job doing. because like I can't tell you, you're not, I you'd have to be the specific need in question with the specific life experiences to give them certain interests and abilities to concentrate on certain tasks, you should just try what looks like it could be okay, but you have to shed the idea that it has to conform to like, well it's not political enough, I'm not changing the world enough by doing it, or it's beneath my educational level or something like that, which is what made me for years miserable, and I know a lot of other people. you need to just start with something you think you might find something enjoyable about and that you could get a job doing, and then you see how that treats you, but you cannot dismiss things because you don't have, it it can't be anything that you can't, if you've just made the decision that you've got to get to work, the like all right, i have to leave the house, then you cannot make up conditions that require something else, so if that's the conditions, then the conditions are. what you think you might like and what you can get uh guns germs and steel obviously it's not got it's not everything it's not correct but i think it's got a lot of insights and i know that it's something that i've used to put together a lot of my worldview like having red guns journs and steel the walter shedle book that i'm reading feels like it really they feel like overlapping like uh historical observations and and they click together even if details might be wrong and then level uh, it's another like building block, it's it's a good book, it's worth, it's worth engaging with, as they say now, hobsb is great, hobsb is great, but you know uh, yeah, no, he's good, is south korea the future uh? I mean maybe for some people in maybe on a leseum uh walenstein world systems uh you know now that I've now that I'm uh like I'm trying to apply you know these like these concepts to uh the dialectical concepts to history more uh world system cery which used to kind of baffle me a little bit uh I kind of got the contours now seems very intuitive i i want to. more about it, i have not heard of the game ultimate general civil war, but that sounds cool, socialism is always possible, socialism is possible until the last fire burns out, because we still have agency, the level of socialism will be determined by how much of our uh material environment has been deemed destroyed. I mean socialism could be two people splitting the last can of croker beans over a dying fire uh the level that was up to us so when we say oh we we're like yeah we at a certain level we can't challenge capitalism right now but there will always be a a a difference a change in circumstances that brings with it a change in our material uh uh position to power and that that's something we can uh we can strive to be ready for that's all we can do. Hone our blade and wait, and hone and wait, and then strike. Socialism is the deep death of the universe, yes. Socialism is like the the vision of socialism as a social structure is the end state of uh like the uh is is is the last stage before total imminence before the total uh the moment when all space and time literally occupy the same area. what makes something liberal uh is it's presumption of... the individual as an untouched prime mover, i would say that's the that's the best definition of liberalism, is it started presumption, humans is prime movers as as opposed to uh things that are acted upon? that would be my definition of liberalism, which is what's so funny about combat liberalism everyone's favorite mau text, because everything in, i don't want to get anybody, i don't want to get people mad at me and there's only a few minutes left before i sign off, but combat liberalism is liberal, because it says, he's not describing a specific thing a comrad does, he's responding a type of thing that people do that can be applied to anybody in any situation if the reasoning is motivated, it assumes people are operating uh from first position instead of in a dialectical relationship with reality that starts with reality, hate to hate to piss people off. but combat liberalism is liberal because it assumes an unmoved mover, it tells people stop doing this, instead of changing the material conditions that makes them do the thing, it is liberal combat, and it's like there's a reason that mau was so popular in college campuses, because those people were the most liberal subjects to ever exist, the boomers, they were the first most intensified liberal subjects and so of course. is going to make more sense to them than Marx or Lenin, I'm a liberal to some extent, yes, I'm a liberal in so at the at the social level of respecting that there are other people who have equal rights as I do, but at that point i stop, I don't take the next step to say, that means that they choose their own decisions as I do, no, they're socially contexted as I am to them. because that isn't that like the idea of being uh, the idea of of of of liberalism to the that is a found, that is before liberalism even, that's literally to even have a social order that is beyond like a a a a uh a clannish like hive that that has strangers in it basically, a social order in which you engage with strangers requires that degree of liberalism, but beyond that, uh, it buds off into dialectical and and individualist, at least in the west, so yeah, my combat liberalism is liberal, a black, liberals are gonna get blackpilled by by conditions, you're not going to be able to convince them that that, they're going to just use every evidence of awfulness to further their their their set ideas. blaming it on Trump, blaming it on Russia if Trump doesn't work, now maybe even blaming it on the Chinese, some of the liberals are blaming the Chinese, only a change in their material conditions and circumstances is going to change the way they apportion blame for their condition, so that's another thing where like I can't, you can't own your parents on Facebook or people on Twitter into becoming more blackpilled because they're too comfortable right now and they're comfortable channeling. their disconent that they do have that is mostly symbolic on to Trump on to the uh republicans, they have to have so much more material conditions that they have, and the thing is that doesn't mean that you then have to carry out things that make that happen, because the worse it gets faster, the hard the more likely people are going to react badly to the trauma, that is why you can't bring about the collapse, you have to work within the existing collapse. All right guys, I'm done for the day, I think this was a good one, had fun, uh, I'm sorry that the chat is lame as shit, but uh, I have a little control over that. um, talk to you guys tomorrow, peace, and I'd like to talk about the Typing rebellion, maybe tomorrow, it's pretty, it's really interesting, someone mentioned it, but we forgot, but anyway, peace and chicken grease.
