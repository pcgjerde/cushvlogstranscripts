 feel like honking pill feel a honking. feel like hanking pills, don't feel like hanking pills with you, boom baby, i live without you, i live without honk, hank hank everybody, it's hank pill time again, uh, are people doing sea chanties on tiktok, this is called? appropriation honestly from uh from coastal uh salt dogs and i will not sand for it. i'm triggering people by drinking a white clot. i'm embodying beckyhood. i have become becky. destroyer of worlds. that's me. so apparently people are starting to post out of context uh clips from the streams to try to uh cancel me. but my takes are just too strong and correct to uh to be cancelled so once again uh cannot be defeated sorry you're not going to get me because my every word and sentence and expression is a perfectly crafted conceptual uh item and none of it is going to be uh you could do nothing but try to squind at it to try to find out to try to make up something and sorry sorry folks for the discerning online denison there's just no way for it to uh hold water so boom so I'm I'm always uh I always feel validated when people try to own me for my posts and my correct statements but they can't because they're correct and uh that is the defense they say the best that the... the pure defense against reliable is the truth right? well there you go, i cannot be held accountable, you can't do it. of course, this quote would be great pulled out after i've been held accountable somehow, could happen, but right now i don't think so, right now there's no way i could possibly be held accountable, cannot hold me counterable. cannot hold me to account, cannot be held accountable, cannot hold me to account, i can't be held account, you cannot hold me to account, i will not be held accountable, you cannot, you cannot, you cannot, you cannot hold me, you cannot hold me, you cannot hold me to account, there you go, i'll make that my ringtone, go pack indeed, all right, so apparently they might impeach him, actually on the 19th, which would be hilarious, and that would make that would make sense, because the whole argument for impeachment right now is that it is symbolically important to show a line that you can't cross, and I could definitely see republicans getting behind, established republicans especially, getting behind making that a bright line, because does it looks a little dicier and less under controllable than a lot of them are probably happy with, but they're want to want to string it out as long as possible, and they're going to want to reduce antagonizing these people as long as possible, so doing it symbolically like an hour before, he leaves office would be perfect, the perfect sort of thing that looks like action and people can convince themselves is proof that our democratic structures work, but is in every respect just stage managed bit of public relations. yes, yes, I know impeachment and removal are different, but they could remove them too, like an hour before he's supposed to leave anyway, although that's a lot of senators, that's a... lot of senators and yes the senators are less uh less vulnerable obviously but a third of them presumably a number of republicans although not that many buse it's a very... bad map for democrats next time on the senate and honestly the fact that they they had a great map this time and the fact that they were able to what get to 550 was honestly a disaster for them and it means they're definitely going to lose the senate in two years unless of course you know they're able to hang this around their neck and everybody cares about this and it becomes the new political litmus test for uh you know seriousness and i don't know we'll see about that but you don't want to have to run for re-election in two years having voted to kick him out of office guaranteed to guaranteed you're done and a lot of these senators like that's not the worst thing in the world oh you lose your lose your spot oh no now i have to get a pay bump to be a lobbiist this is terrible it'll be interesting to see certainly if we do get, i got to say though, as i said last time, if you're worried about this whole thing breaking down, then you clearly don't get it, because this is bad news, everything is on a trajectory to shit, and i mean a world where you don't feel like there's nothing to do but post, isn't that a more, isn't that a more vital life, even if it's scarier, at least you're scared of like real stuff, you're not just scaring yourself about computer narratives, but like i said more than anything, that's why I don't think that there's going to be some sort of catastrophic confrontation, because it would be too destabilizing, and I don't think that there's any real reason to believe that uh, the the choke points and the uh, the choke points and the coersive and seductive mechanisms of power that currently exist are in any way been undermined or compromised to a permanent end by uh, the shit fit in the capital last week, i'm not blaming anybody for posting, i'm a poster, i'm a poor, i'm a i'm a pure posting machinery, took all of my uh energies and put them out there, i don't recommend it for everybody. RIP to a real one Shelden Adelson uh you know my first gig opening for him at a uh at a masad torture cave that he was uh visiting that he had funded personally yeah a real rest in pice Sheldon Adelson but of course you know he's got the world he wanted he got he got a untrameled Israel that's able to do uh Yakitski uh, Yakovitski and reform Zionism, congratulations, they got their iron wall, and now he gets to go to uh, he doesn't even get to go to heaven right, there is is there, is there's not a Jewish heaven, they name a bunch of stuff after Shabatinski, that's it, they name a bunch of stuff after him in Israel, so he gets that instead, going to heaven. Uh, there's one thing I wanted to say about elaborate on yesterday that I forgot when I was talking about the beautiful boaters and I was talking about the the regional barons who make up our you, Lumpin ruling class out in the hinterlands, the real divide as we know now like demographically and electorally and politically and culturally is between urban and in rural areas and the suburbs are the liminal area between them and like the democrats uh gains for Biden mostly came in those suburbs where those lim those people those those knowledge economy workers who aren't the hipsters who fill up gentrified neighborhoods who want to be out in the suburbs and want to have a house but work in a professional capacity uh are moving towards the democrats because of how unhinged and um and iratic andrational the republicans are being, but of course that's not every one of these white supermanites, the ones who work in things like, I don't, law enforcement, they are hardening in their other in their position otherwise, but anyway that's the liminal space, and the thing about these rural areas is you know, um, they they have towns in them, they have cities, but they're just they're smaller, they're more provincial, uh, and the people who live there. and what they all have in common is that those places used to be where people farmed and where people where farming and agriculture still occur but not on the family. that used to be there, the the yoman small holding farmer that was the model American citizen and and uh and for whom America was created extensively, that survived as obviously it's survived as the mental idea of freedom that that reactionaries have to this day in America, but it survived much longer than a lot of people think in the country itself, you didn't see the real collapse of small holding farming in America, I mean obviously you saw a big... move away from agricultural labor to urban uh labor as technology decreased the amount of human inputs that were required to farm but you still had family farms and it wasn't until the 80s uh and the work of uh guys like Ed Butts who was uh Reagan's racist agricultural secretary Earl Buts rather not Ed sorry Earl Buts uh helped create uh a modern agricultural subsidy program that boomed the small farm for the most part, there still are small farmers around the country and they are as small holders ever are deeply reactionary, but the people who used to have those farms got, they didn't all go to the city and learn a code, they stayed around and became sort of a resentful uh and unmanned, you know, removed from like the matrix of of sufficiency and uh self-sufficiency and self uh, you know, actualization that they used to that used to be a possibility uh for agricultural uh for people own farms, people who were able to buy some land and and work it. now that's mostly connegra and and archer Daniels midland and Monsanto, and and a lot of it is, and a lot of the actual labor is performed by immigrants, illegal, many of them illegally uh, illegally employed, and the... people used to farm that are still there and the only story they hear is the story of the mad little crimson kings who run those little thiefdoms and they've all directed their psychic energy towards the big crimson king in the white house i i guess he's in the white house okay this is actually something that's trip uh freaking me out a little bit is about how Trump has not been heard from since they took his twitter account away he's the president he could just step out the rose garden and there'd be reporters in f minutes and he could just start riffing, he hasn't demanded to go on tv, he hasn't done a press conference, has he paid a public statement, he i i know they're saying he's going to go to the alamo or apparently alamo texas which is a town, just the stupidest people on earth, they don't know what the alamo is, they know alamo, that's where they fought the mexicans, alamo texas, building uh town, we don't know, so did he say anything today? but the fact that he's having it in San Antonio or in Alamo really shows you that he has run up the red white flag and it'll be interesting to see how long it takes for these people to get it that he has thrown in the towel buse he'd stay in Washington if he really wanted to press this thing he might do it at an alamo rental car a lot that'd be funny like the i mean the four seasons thing in philadelphia will still not be topped for pure ioducci. that is pure uncut Yanucci the four seasons oh uh four seasons lawn supply by the air by the fucking airport. I do wonder if somebody slapped him, like I wonder if one of the choin chief just hit him in the face, that would be funny. "i would not, somebody's asking about who would be the protagonist of the moth man movie, i would not really want it to have a traditional protagonist, i would want it to be more um more removed and more uh pointilist, i guess like incidents, not really a like with across the characters that maybe has a threline like keel would certainly be in a lot of it, but i wouldn't want them to be like have an interiority necessarily, i'm not gonna" just not going to happen, it is amazing when they try to get me cancelled, i'm just such a nice boy you can't do it, i'm a nice boy with correct takes, you can't get too mad at me or and when you do you just look unhinged, everyone gets mad at me just looks uh like they have spent too much time online, i saw that red letter media is going to do a review of the blob, people are saying more and more folks, the blob tremendous, people the horror the si-fi horror of the 80s, people talk about a lot, like the thing is obviously now, i mean i'm sure would john carpenter would have really appreciated it if people back then liked it as much as they do now, but the king is the the thing is a towering achievement and it's one of the big reasons that i cannot credit anybody who argues that ridley scott is in a hack because oh he made alien, i'm sorry, the thing is better than alien and it came out like two years later, it's not even the best si-fi horror movie of like the three-year period that it came out in, i am not fucking interested in hearing about alien compared to fucking the thing, and of course kronenberg's the fly, great movie, be afraid, be very afraid, snapping the arm, puking on the donnut, shotgun to the head. can't beat it, but the fucking blah man, written by Frank Darabon doesn't have, I can't even remember who directed it, not a uh, not a auturis thing that has been uh recaptured, but in my opinion as good as those movies and in terms of its special effects, maybe a little better, the blob in that movie is so fucking good, and my favorite thing about that film narratively is how nasty it is, how it kills several characters. are set up as the protagonist of the movie early on, how it kills a kid? it's a pimp movie and it rules, it it lost money, it's another movie that failed, so i guess the only one of those that succeeded at the time was the fly, because i think the fly was a success, tremmers is a perfect movie, come on, Yeah, Frank Darabon and Chuck Russell wrote the screenplay who and the director was Chuck Russell who made uh, he made nightmare and Elm street three dream warriors, which I have not seen since I was a kid, he directed eraser with Schwarzenager, your luggage, and the scorpion king, wow, that is a, that is an interesting career, uh, he directed the mask too, oh smoking, not allrighty then, smoking, and he directed fringe, the tv show fringe, i am wrath, that terrible travolta ripoff of uh deathwish, which i watched with will last year, i don't think we even got through the whole thing, god damn, how the hell do you, how do you make one great? movie and then never hit the hit it again, you probably don't know why your movie is good honestly, but anyway the blog great fell, i feel like somebody says the mask is cringe now, i don't know if that's true, i feel like the mask has made a comeback because once you get through all the levels of irony you are back to luny tunes, you're back to a guy hitting himself on with a on a head with a cartoon mallet, it's the only thing can do once you've you know got too sophisticated in your comedy and anti-comedy stylings, eraser came out the same year as uh mission impossible and has the same plot as mission impossible, it also has some amazingly terrible CGI crocodiles, which coming from Chuck Russell who made one of the great practical effects movies of all time, really does tell you that the that when they brought. those computers, it really was the deathnell for craft in film effects, your luggage, your luggage, god, i saw i didn't watch that whole schwarznager video, i saw that it was seven minutes long, but there is an alternative world, alternative america where we did not have uh, where we did not have. a constitutional requirement of uh citizenship or like native-born citizenship to run for president, and Schwarzenegger not doesn't replace Trump as like the republican party because that is go that was going in the direction it was going no matter what, but as like some sort of um like high charisma spectaclized codification of like democrat neoliberalism because at this point he is a democrat, Schwarznegger is a democrat, I don't care what he calls himself, he was, I mean, by the time he left office, he governed basically as the same way nusum and and Brown do, uh, and he could have and he could have been like the the counterweight bause now we're in this dangerously un uh balanced situation where Trump is this you know this fucking all father who was able to summon the fucking the the the the thunder from the depths of the earth with his voice because he's able to connect to people at that level of fame and american um the the classic American con artistry and hustling. uh a charisma, Schwarznager has is better than Trump at all of those things and he could have provided a alternative, now not an alternative to you know neoliberal hell, just an alternative public expression of like specticalized politics that could have given something for uh for the non-republican base to care about and for non-republican non-voters to care about, as it is stands now, we have this totally vapid uh... democratic party that stands for nothing and isn't able to replicate the spectacular uh figure of Barack Obama, that was the whole point as I said before of that primary, why they let it go so long and why they risked Bernie winning is because they needed to fucking like throw people out there and have the fucking assholes in the tastemakers in Iowa and New Hampshire find the person who could replicate the the the Obama magic couldn't be done, there's nobody there, Schwarzneger could have done it. but without with now he can't run for president, he can't run for president here, so sorry, not going to work, too bad, too bad, but like I said, it would still be terrible, it would just, it would be more likely that the democrats could actually like discipline the Republicans and their base, which we'll see how much they're able to do it, because like I said, I think they're terrified of seeing of pushing against the Republicans because they're afraid of them. making a decision to just not accept their intimidation, which when you're talking about the democrats trying to intimidate people, it's very understandable why they're like that. Oh no, Cuba back on the state sponsor of terrorism with, it'll be interesting to see how much of this stuff uh Biden rolls back and how much they just let there and act like they have no control over, because remember guys, oh those florida cubans and and the and the word socialism, that's what cost them Florida. someone's asking about uh the Persian Gulf, everything being everybody has sort of been failing, including me to notice that there's been a very significant build-up of uh US military and Israeli military operations there, subs run some israeli subs running around, Israelis uh, they've been stepping up bombing into Syria, uh, they assassinated that fucking uh Iranian nuclear scientist and the US Nimits is out there fucking toolling around just waiting to crash into some boats and this is all after the secret meeting between Pompeo and NBS uh right after which the they declared the hoothis a fucking terrorist organization which is completely idiotic and and is going to just get more people killed once again we'll see if Biden bothers to lift a finger on that one but it seems like what they're trying to do is uh essentially like lash the tiller to the to the uh uh to the door uh and in such a way that ensures that Biden is doesn't have a free hand to reset US policy towards Iran away from the brinksmanship that it's currently being defined by. And you know to which degree Biden even wants to do that is up in the air, but they're ensuring that it won't be up to them, that there will be no way to reverse course by the time they take power. Another great, another real reason uh, another reason for uh why it's absolutely great that we have a what almost three months yeah two and a half month no almost three months yes almost three month period between the presidential election and the inauguration of the winner because we have to make sure everybody can get their fucking horse carts to washington in time what's amazing is that it used to be longer it used to be March. They didn't change that until uh as until they passed I believe the 25th amendment uh and they just moved it up to January just I guess it's like well we you know we want to give him the whole calendar year can you imagine if it was March if that hadn't changed oh man. the 20th, yeah, it's amazing how many of those amendments are just mess are just actually fixing just bureaucratic elements from the original constitution, that's how hastily and shitly drawn that thing was, such an insane idea to federate it fetishically, but of course you must be pointed out that there is no ideology, there's no content to the uh constitutional fetishization in this country, nobody does it because it's is such a great document, they do it because they imagine that it exists to, and they're correct, for the most part, that it exists to maintain their privileges. in that respect it is very similar to the magnakarta, which we which is thought of popularly by dollards like the ones we try to say, oh the magna says you don't have to wear mask in me chip shop. those things are not law rules, those things are not the prerogatives of regular people, those are privileges of the barons. and and the constitution exists to maintain baronial privileges in in in this in a vibrant context of like democratic demands from below, here's your democracy, but here is the guard guard guard rails on it, well that will prevent it from actually becoming democratic, you can't break now. don't have to wear a mask on the lory, look at the magna carter, it says the king can only tax my wool exports once a fortnite, how many wool esports do you have, you fucking assholes, i do love that they have a constitution in the Britain that is not written down, which makes sense when you consider that the whole thing flows from the common law tradition, which is all just laws made up literally as they went along, which meant that at every level they were attempts to accommodate power as it currently existed, because that's how you make decisions, it's oh, here's a new thing, here's a new challenge, you're not finding some platonic concept, you're not finding a razer sharp piece of fully persuasive legal reasoning, you are saying, okay, how do we accommodate this? conflict with the system as it exists, with the distributive mechanisms we have in place, that is why napoleon was the good guy, i'm sorry, i mean obviously he was he was a megal maniac and he caused a lot of deaths, but in the battle between the british and the french, i'm sorry, jack, captain jack aubre is a reactionary. This is interesting, someone says in the chat, there uh, his dad is a const, my dad is such a constitutional fetishist, he thought the designated survivor in the line of succession was in the 1783 document, that's so funny, because all it says in the constitution about the state of the union is that once a year the president will be required to uh deliver or to deliver to the congress a um like a statement of of this the nation or whatever. It's it, the content of it is is totally TBD, the the way that it is presented is completely TBD, it was originally just sent to congress written, and then like the sergeant at arms or somebody would read it out loud. Uh, I believe it wasn't till Wilson that the president started delivering it in front of uh both houses and then only after that are people like, oh shit, they somebody might blow them all up, somebody might uh, somebody might guy fox their assess, there's not. in the constitution about anything, it all had to be made on the spot, that is why the only reason it worked is because George Washington was around, George Washington in in an era when the the elites of the 13 colonies were all divided by state, which had to change, but at the moment it was not, they were individual like ruling elites, political and economic ruling elites and they all made wanted, they needed to come together under a federal government if they were going to get their fucking money back that they put into the... war effort more than anything, it was it was a bond, the the beards talk about this in the origin of the American constitution, it was a bunch of bond holders wanting to make sure that they didn't get left holding the bag, which means it was the richest people in all the fucking parts of in all the states, so they needed a central government, but the thing they were afraid of was not their precious liberties in the way we get told it to us, they were afraid about their prerogatives, their ruling class prerogatives being in any way uh take it. from them and like abstracted towards a state interest, an interest that was beyond their narrow specific interest, which of course in their minds was the interest of all mankind, because they were good enlightenment psychos. and so there was a Mexican standoff, the and and this whole document, it got a lot of resistance, there was a whole anti-federalist movement against it, the federalist papers had to be written to propagandize the thing, because these local power uh holders, especially the ones who were most distant from finance capital, like southern land owners for example, except for guys like George Washington by the way, who had a ton of fucking uh uh sitting on a ton of bonds and was actually very cash poor. to the revolution and had a very significant uh economic incentive to get behind central government and he um was the man of the revolution, he was the man who beat the British and most importantly did not become king after that who went home, became cincinatus, and because he'd already done that, he'd already turned down power, everybody who was making the constitution, assumed that you could trust him with this position and so he just made it up, he made up what presidential powers were as he was president, and because he was like self-consciously trying to knit together a national interest out of the states interest, he did what they wanted, but the problem for especially the southerners was, oh no, he's actually creating a central government, no, oh we didn't want, like sorry idiots, you have to have that. like the federalists were in like a marxian sense the progressive force in the early constitutional era and you can point out the fact that they were ripping off the the the veterans of the revolution and the smallholders in order to you know feather the bed of bond holders, correct, but they were also making it possible for capital to concentrate, which if you don't have it, you have a a uh decadent uh stagnant. society, which is what uh antibelum slave culture became, and which is the inevitable byproduct of of of of uh allowing capital to accumulate individually and not allowing capital to become something that can be um accumulated and uh dispersed like from a central perspective instead of by you know the million fucking individual plantation owners along the Mississippi river. and uh that, but that anti-federalist notion of unrestrained baronial power, that is... the engine of American reaction ever since and it has manifested itself in different places and in different parties over the history of America, but now it is firmly ensconced and in fact like the governing ethos of the Republican party, but it was the original motive force of the democratic party. but it was I would say it was the democratic uh, it was Tamani really, more than anything, it was the democratic subordination and uh and client relationship with the emergent working class of the cities that ensured that over time the democrats would essentially become the federalist wig party of uh like interventionist government. The anti-federalist thought, because we have all the land. we have basically unlimited land, we don't need government, all these the government exists to to like um over see disputes over resources like and uh you know police uh labor relationships, but if you have self-sufficient farms and slave plantations, although you know guys like jefferson will assure you over time this lucrative uh labor relationship that creates its own completely contained like cultural context where it's all of it's like... worse deficiencies become like load-bearing psychic structures, it'll just go away over time, that's because they didn't realize how much more profitable cotton would get, but if you have that, if you have like throlldom where you don't have to worry about politics because politics is the master's whip, or sufficient small holders who don't have to worry about uh working for a boss or disputing a paycheck uh just get goods to market, then you basically don't need a government, that was the theory, but you never have all the land, and even if you did, you still have to fucking like if you want to be a small holding sufficient farmer, you have to be able to sell your surplus, you have to be able to sell your surplus product of your farming, otherwise you're just a subsistence farmer, and the whole point is that you can go beyond subsistance to improve land, invest capital into your land. and buy finished goods, that's the most important thing, exchanging your agricultural surplus for finished manufactured goods, where do they make manufactured goods, jefferson's hated cities, literally a a literally um symbiotic relationship between city and countryside and Yeah, but but it's bad so it shouldn't exist. Okay, good, that's that'l that's that has anything to do with anything, fuck out of here. Well, Haiti, uh, somebody asked about Napoleon in Haiti. I mean, one, it's not like the British were better guys at that point, they didn't, they didn't ban slavery until the 1830s, so all of those Caribbean uh, like the difference between Jamaica and Haiti is Haiti had a fucking rebellion, if Jamaica had a... rebellion and Jamaica had several very violent uh uh and part and like momentarily successful slave operations that were brutally suppressed by the British they would have they would have done just the horrible stuff that the French did uh but his decision to uh try to retake Hadey made probably in part because of his the fact that his wife Josene was a descendant of the planters of the big whites of the island was a terrible decision and not and like morally obviously but you know in the context of early 19th century uh morality, he's probably about an average for Europeans understandings, especially since so much of the uh the wonderful luxury economy of of British of French cuisine and and uh and indulgent life was fueled by agriculture, slave agriculture in the new world, but more than anything, it was a... fucking mistake as Tally Ran said about uh about the execution uh of what's his name it was worse than wrong, it was worse than a crime, it was a mistake um because uh, because he there was a a figure of comp and honestly if he if he if he had done that who knows what he would have gotten out of that conversation because one of the the big reason that napoleon tried to reconquer Haiti is because at that point he thought the only way that he was going to be able to change the balance. of power with Europe uh after uh Trifolger was by uh reinvesting his strategic situation in the Caribbean and like turning the Caribbean like into a French lake uh because at that point you know everything past the Mississippi was technically Franciss and New Orleans which is a major port in the Caribbean was French territory but the real answer to that. strategic question is a lie with two song, what are you doing? but to give uh, but to give napoleon a little credit. he did admit when he was on uh saint helena that that was a boner, he shouldn't have done that, and yeah, that's one of the reasons they sold us it to us and that's a big. what if i talk about contingencies and counterfactuals, what if that, what if that back door, that free real estate backdoor was closed, cuz we weren't in a position to fight the French for the continent, you know, maybe we actually have to reckon with our political problems instead of fantasizing them away and turning us into this nation of fat toddlers who cannot reckon with political conflict because we've never... been forced to uh resolve any, we just find the people who can take it because they don't have political representation in the system, we give it to them hard, be they black, be they native American, be they immigrant, uh, and and or poor, just poor in general, and then everybody else gets a lollipop, but we're out of lollipops, and now we don't know how to deal with politics. but yeah, you want to talk about alternative North America, how about one where napoleon makes a deal with Tusan, recognizes Haitian independence and then has him invade uh, like uh Mississippi, has tous lead a black army into the heart of Mississippi, liberate all those plantations, and give people guns, not likely, but you can imagine it, napolian wanted to invade Britain, he made several attempts, the the they attempted to uh land troops in Ireland during the the the 98 revolution, that was before Napoleon, but there was a longstanding french uh plans during that whole period to just invade Britain, because it's just it's it's so frustrating, if you're to pull how frustrating must it be, like you marched across all of continental Europe and you just dust the the greatest armies of thousand year dynasties and you just bat them away like fucking chest pieces, and then the this island full of wool merchant cheese eating dipshits, these fucking bad tooth uh chinless freaks, these lidless uh huns to just like eat boiled beef on a little... shitty collection of islands, you can't just walk over them because they ruled the sea, they ruled the goddamn waves, and what's interesting about the the British domination of the sea is it really didn't even come down to technology or anything, it literally came down to the fact that because they were like the the premier naval power, i mean they were a fucking island and they had invested the in naval uh develop. for a long time, whereas like big continental powers like France were inward looking, they were able to develop a store, like a a a storyhouse of best practices and um and skill distribution that just made their crews better, they were better at being seamen, they were better at boat shit, they were just better at it, didn't matter the resource distinctions. Nelson, somebody says Nelson was a psycho. Nelson is one of the most despicable figures I've ever read about. Who is traditionally thought of is like a military hero, buse obviously, you know, every everybody who is venerated by history is some sort of criminal or scoundral, and that's fine, you if you're occupying history skage, you are in a sense you have to be operating beyond concepts of good and evil, or else what are you doing there? uh, so you have to judge them that way, but Nelson was just a a glory. founding psychopath who was willing to risk the lives of everybody uh for pure personal glory, like he is the exactly type of showboater that you know traditional shivelrous masculinity is supposed to look down on, but they got a giant fucking uh dildo with him on it in in London, he did fuck, he was a notorious uh cocksman who had a very... public uh scandal about involving improprieties with society ladies uh, but he was just a a complete veanglorious, the kind of character who is um historically like if you if they were accurately portrayed you know in a in a film or something would be like a stereotype of of narcissistic veing glory, very much like custer, custer is a similar figure. Nelson Custer of course is not anywhere nearly as good a cavalryman as Nelson was a uh sailor, I mean Nelson was actually very good at what he did, custer was a complete buffoon. but they had a similar uh just psychotic narcissism, yes they did blow up the pillar in Dublin, which I got to say, that good on you, that's that's just good form in my opinion, that's the thing that people who hate on statue destruction don't get, they say you're destroying history, like just pulling a fucking statue down is making history, now of course it should not substitute for politics. and one of the ways you knew that the summer demonstrations were going to peter out without real uh long-term impact was when they started doing that, but like as an isolated incident and as like a specifically targeted event, it it is, it is historical in his own way, like blowing up the fucking Nelson statue in Dublin, that is a historical event, if that thing was still there, how much more boring would that be uh then? uh then having the story of it being blown up in his fucking head landing in somebody's garden, custer's one military exploit with any kind of uh meaning or uh behind it, like any any the only real credit in his record is the third day of gettiesburg when he prevented the cavalry uh attack on the union rear that was supposed to coincide with picket's charge and might have changed if it had been. successful might have changed the outcome there, but that's about it. best civil war general, i mean that's a weird category, i don't know, i would say, there's different ways, so many different ways to say best, there's different ways to like define best, my i think that one of the most like uh, i mean it's It's annoying that like Stone wall Jackson was genuinely brilliant, but I hate him and I don't want to talk about that, but like Thomas, I'm a big fan of George Thomas, the rock of chickamaga, uh, I mean he destroyed uh John Bell Hood's army, but John Bell Hood basically gave him the hammer, but you know he did a good job at it, nonetheless, saved the army at chickamaga along with August Willitch and Ambrose Beerce were all there, defending Snodd Grass Hill, all right, I don't think they were on Snodg grass Hill, but but that's where Thomas was, but they were all a Chikamuga, uh, bringing a salmer to uh, well, I mean, first of all, statues are almost never uh, like as historically meaningful as like a cathedral, I mean, especially when you're talking about American confederate statues, are mass produced brand Schlock, they're basically Bob's big boys that were all built in the early 1900s by the daughters of the confederacy, like there's much as there's much as like a a historical, you know, there's as much historical value to them as like a bob's big boy sign, yeah, now I'm the last i'm a broken man on a hellf peer the last privateers I like George Thomas uh I like Sherman a lot uh I'll always have a soft spot for grant just because he's such a uh he's a hard guy that to sympathize with for me anyway, he seems like essentially a protofail son, he seems like the kind of guy, he's like a a model for a guy who was, here you go, he was given the same lively, he was given the same chances that everybody was in like the fertile uh early um the fertile um the the fertile middle west you know or at that point it was like the northwest uh in Ohio you know his dad was a relative... successful uh a tanner uh you know he didn't he was he was his family wasn't as poor as like the uh the Lincolns were even uh but he didn't want to be a tanner tanning sucks and then he he went to west point because it was a thing to do he didn't really want to be a soldier and then he fought in the war he he found out he's good at some things the mexican war he hated the war he fought in but he learned some things he learned how to ride a horse he was good at that and he learned he was cool under fire then they sent him to Garrison a bunch of fucking in forts in California in the middle of nowhere and he just drank himself out of a job and then he went back to the mid-west and with the same opportunity that millions of Americans were given to make something of himself. he fucking ate shit at everything, just ate shit at everything, which is why he is there of the the mirror image of McLallen, a guy who had you know visioned himself as a military genius since he was a child and was finished very top of his class at west point as opposed to grant was a middling student uh and then one a few early engagements in the West Virginia which helped allow West Virginia to essentially succede from Virginia uh and was heralded in the eastern press and essentially. bought his own hype and went insane like uh that kids in the hall sketch where uh Kevin McDonald gets promoted to head uh the head male clerk and immediately snaps and like buys giant gold rings and beats people to that. This guy thought that he could marsh on Washington and overpro the government. He wrote that in a letter I think to his wife after getting some good early newspaper clippings and then he went to confront Lee and he was so terrified of losing he was. so terrified of failing that he was frozen, grant had failed his whole life, he wasn't afraid of failing, somebody wants me to talk about the English civil war, I might talk about it future, because it's a very interesting subject that gets undertalked about, but somebody in the comments is saying that 1688 is more interesting, and you're think about the English civil war, like periodization is more important, I think than trying to keep things pitthy, and the same way you could argue that like world war one and two are part of one larger process, uh, that the same is true of the English civil war and the glorious revolution, and you don't, it's really one event, and it is this prolonged crisis of authority in like an a budding capitalist system that is emerging out of like a decaying feudal husk? and it was a battle over like what is the um actual like proper place for um you know authority to reside in a merchant social order that is uh breaking away from the the feudal bonds of you know just the old feudal aristocracy and creating a new class like the people who overthrew uh the king and cut his fucking head off it was a class there was a class character. like parliamentarians were urban merchants broadly, there were of course big land owners who were parliamentarians, but the base of the new model army was that, east anglian people who were engaged in the new merchant economy that was emerging out of their, England in the low countries what became modern capitalism, at least where I put it, like after some fits and starts and early creations, like the thing really kicked into gear there, and they'... wanted essentially to rest power away from this old feudal order represented by the king, but it was premature because the fucking social basis for that kind of government didn't exist yet, you still were dealing largely with a feudal uh a a feudaly organized society, even though feudalism had been obviously in crisis and collapsed for centuries, it had not yet created a alternative like social mechanism of authority, and so the attempts to stand up parliamentary democracy without an attendant social information immediately collapsed and Cromwell kept having to fucking step back in. I know that there's it's obviously very self-serving the way that he always acted like, oh, I've been forced to interven back here, uh, but I honestly do feel like if they could have put together a viable parliamentary order, Cromwell would have Washingtoned it, but he couldn't, he couldn't. Washington was able to walk away because the social uh base existed to stand up a parliamentary. democracy in America, that didn't exist in the 1650s and so he just had to basically be the king with no without a name and that was not going to last, and then so they bring back the royals, but they bring back with the royals all the old questions about the Catholic Church as a stand-in for medieval authority, you know, and bringing in those dutchmen, because the dutch people actually were the ones who invented the fucking uh like concept of a uh of a merchant. based uh capitalist economic order, like that's where the stock market first opened, that's where the first joint stock company was chartered, and the british essentially just took it from the like when the fucking uh royal fleet uh sailed into New York Harbor and went up to Peter Scivents one legged ass and said, hey bitch, we're taking this from you and we're changing the name too, and so it say hey you guys, how you guys actually were forming these structures before us even? can we just borrow your king? your king who's been like kind of capitalized, kind of soified as it were, protestantized? and we'll we'll take him, we'll we'll take him from you, we'll take him off your hands, we're their ruling class or whatever, the the their their gentry had learned their lesson, what are the what is the chat fighting about, someone's fighting, i need to resolve this chat fight before i log off. when are the packers playing? i haven't really watched the game this year, i will not, i will not lie, but i try to watch the playoffs, apparently there's one dumb ass in the chat, god damn them all, i was told we'd sell the seas for american gold, we'd fire no guns, shed no tears, now i'm broke man, halifax peer the last. so where it's privateers, I might watch, we'll see, people seem to be talking about what's cringe, you, I think that as well, I am guilty of having used that word and trafficked and cringe talk, but you really have to kill that concept if you're ever going to be able to act, because all action is cringe, all acts can be abstracted away from the context where they make sense and turned into something embarrassing, and if you worry all the time about your actions not being cringeworthy, you will never be able to do anything. that's basically what uh what David Foster Wallis's entire corpus was about, how cringeus is uh, is essentially social, the most essential post-modern, post cap, post-industrial mechanism of control, ah, the putney debate, don't we love it, folks, we love the, we love the diggers, we love the levelers too, don't we, we love them. Jeren Winstanley was the the spiritual founder of the diggers in the aftermath of the English civil war or the Interegnum I guess before the final glorious triumph of uh of anglo-dutch protestant capitalism over uh anglo-Irish uh land-based feudalism, but Jared Winstanley. uh he wrote uh a pamphlet where he essentially prefigured Marx's theory of class struggle as the engine of history uh what 150 years before Marx did uh or 200 years yeah like 200 years 16 yeah 165 yeah uh and he says that as long as as long as some labor for others like is basic premise is that like as long as some labor for others they will be in conflict, because that relationship cannot be one of equality, it is one of coersion and a mutual animosity and distrust that come from that, and of course his answer was, a kingdom of God, where all where the need to accumulate is removed by the desire to uh, the desire to live in communion with everybody, and of course, you know, that's essentially what communism would have to be, and I would argue, it will have to have. some sort of spiritual component, I don't think it can be anything connected to a existing structure of faith though, because they are to culturally segregated, but it's going to have there's going to have to be an infusion of meaning into public life in order to allow people to make a new deal, essentially where you trade time for stuff. and people don't want time instead of stuff unless that time has as much value as the stuff does, and because our time is completely uh uh useless to us, our time what our time to what look at our phones, our time to be miserable and be anxious, our time to worry, our time to be disconnected from one another, our time to pursue pleasures that lose their enjoyment with every indulgence. that time, why would we want give me stuff, give me stuff, the time has to have, you have to be able to to spend that time meaningfully, in order for that to make it be a good deal for people. and that's what's so heartbreaking about queuenon is that in many respects and is the sort of popular grafting of alienation and uh and disillusionment with the current economic order with a spiritualized like will to power, they're able to do what they do because they believe they will win, they believe they're right and they'll believe they win, they can win, which is something that no one on the left believes, either of those things. they if they're right, they don't know, they're in a constant conte, a constant personal crisis about whether or not they're right, and not knowing if they're right, inhibits their actions in every move, uh, and they certainly don't think they can win, uh, and the left needs that, the left needs that, but I mean, what they don't have to go to lean on that the queue people do, is the, I mean, Q was made by a combination of honestly, at some point, at some point. the government got involved in Q, there's no question, I don't who started it, but at some point the government got involved somewhere, at not maybe the level of distributing the actual proofs, but at some level of of in of sioping around it, because why wouldn't you? it doesn't make sense, I mean, especially when you consider the hilarious number of actual literal deep state cypers who are deeply and meshed in Q and on at one level or another. but it was also a consumer response, it was a consumer demand being met by the market, and leftism can never be a consumer demand let in the market, that is the problem, and a lot of the people get mad at the left, like the left, they don't want to win, it's a culture of narcissism, it's a bunch of fucking babies, that's all true, but if you're making that point to condemn people and judge them, it's you're just wasting fucking breath, because your... in a much more constrained political context, you cannot depend on the spectaclized gibbrish that people power wash their eyeballs with 24 hours a day to reveal a path towards like effective anti-capitalist action, that's absurd, why would it do that? at least absent like a real coordinated effort, you know, like a ground, a grassroots and like a movement moving towards one another, which we don't have, if it's just going to like emerge spontaneously from engagement with the media and the marketplace, you're just going to end up at q, because q is like every good pyramid scheme and cult, which are basically the same thing, and in many cases are literally the same thing in this country, uh, you need to get people to get involved through their self-interest, and what motivates these people to become q evangelists is yes, meaning, yes, belief. but that's only going to get people to commit so much, what they also get is a chance to market themselves or their products. apparently one of the biggest que uh decoders is some failed screenwriter from New Jersey, the queueman is a failed actor, people all have res, they all have cvs and headshots or they've got a fucking uh trunk full of uh herbal supplements that they want to get you to sell for. them, those motivations reinforce one another, but only towards the direction of madness and jibbering uh savagery, because it's it's America's broken psychy looking in the mirror, the only what what has to emerge to conner that has to be coherent, and it has to be in opposition to the existing fucking sewer grade of information that people swim in, it has to be counter hegemonic, and what I argue against people like the uh, those MMT kids who interviewed me for their podcast, is that that counterhegemonic uh uh like feedback loop cannot be built from within existing media structures and the existing social media structure most specifically, because they are designed to produce the opposite of what you're trying to fucking create. I'm sorry I put that white claw right there, looked like I was doing sponsored content, I swear to god, I'm not, uh, it is, somebody, somebody said, I they were chilled by the sight of me drinking, drinking a white claw, because I embodied white privilege while I was doing it, I think that uh, like status anxiety about white claw really. tells you that everybody is just on here making themselves nervous like Victorian housewives like I read from uh the book last week who all had nervous exhaustion because they were too they were too bored, they were bored house cats, gave themselves anxieties and things to worry about. We are similarly restrained in our ability to express ourselves, and but we have the internet to give us uh anxiety and fainting spells and and nervous exhaustion, and so what do we do, we like, oh, people like me drink white cast, white claw, but I hate people like me, because people like me are me without any of the uh extenuating circumstances that let me give myself. break, everybody else around me is just me and my worst, so I can't uh, I have to like create some elaborate justification either for drinking white claw or not doing it, I just enjoy it because uh, beer is a little too hoppy usually for me, I like a sweet shake, I like it little sweet. All right folks, I'm going to sign off, it's been real, uh, don't do any honk pilling, but I wouldn't do.
