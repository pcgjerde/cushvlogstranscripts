 was that the muppets or? originally did they make that up, did the muppets write that? if so kudos, it's a hell of a song, we all love to listen to it, we all love to hum it sometimes, it's fun for the whole family, you don't even have the uh lyrics to deal with, international, feeling good guys, i feel like i've got, i'm getting, i'm heading towards being able to articulate something uh on paper soon, just put to put that out there cuuse i'm feeling pretty confident, i'll be able to put something together. there soon a write inform uh, i'm just excited about it, so i just wanted to put that out there as as a more of anything as a as a marker so that i don't like get lazy on it because i feel like i could actually uh, i could get myself across anyway, that's all i can really ask, nothing more than that seems uh realistic. uh, man uh, i've been thinking about uh that bungler man, thinking about that bungler, that o bungler, he is as narcissistic as Trump is, he is the it's a mirror, it's amazing, liberals and conservatives have now created like unian archetypes around their collective behaviors in the form of this figure of the United States president and they have polarized around these things and like Donald Trump is the malignant narcissistic heart of American reactionary ideology, which is of course just superstructural aesthetic uh uh ornament to the bipartisan neoliberal economic order that is undergirding all of it and completely depends, and is the two are totally meshed in and are insupparable from and cannot be removed from uh and then the democratic id, the democratic narcissist, the democrat who thinks he's a progressive because he wants what's best for everybody, which is is really just what he imagines is best for him personally in every sense of me what i mean personally uh as in personal pleasure personal uh like uh narcissistic narcissistic self-conception and he is a narcissist in the way that liberals are and these guys both made incredibly improbable runs at the white house when you think about it now unless you want to believe the idea that uh that obama was like a CIA mark project as a kid and they're like we're going to make him president someday. "I mean, maybe he was CIA, maybe his mom was, like her her postings are very suspicious and like anybody, especially at that period in the cold war involved in any kind of international academic outreach, they had an involvement with the CIA, but that cuts both ways really, because it's like, well, everybody had their involvement, but that also means that these organizations, anyone involved in them is has an implicit association with something that they might not specifically have, because not everybody in all these orgs, like even USAID is CIA, I'm sorry, like they don't." they don't know they are, whatever, like they're not agents, they're bureaucrats, and they think that they have that their job is real, that's true in every one of these organizations, but anyway, whatever one way or the other, if you take him for serious as he was in a plant, which I think is silly, he got to where he was, from single motherhood in Hawaii, and and uh, you know, being one of the chume gang, through just a single-minded pursuit of his narcissistic self, like of of of... feeding the furnace of his ego, and what he wanted, because of his, because it was the specifics of his uh background, the specifics of his life experience, what that meant to him was approval from the establishment, approval and absorption and uh ratification by a status quo that he was awhed by and terrified of, even if he recognized its evil, and so he pursued it with a mad gusto, a life. force that makes him, in his own way a genius, this Trump is, and that led him towards absorbing every status, because since the end since, so as a young man, powered by this desire, where do you go, where do you go to make it in the world, you go to college, and when he went to college, he absorbed college, he absorbed it like fucking galactus absorbing a planet, at like a molecular level, he absorbed it, like it's more's, it's big cuuse he's like, oh This is how you get ahead, these are the values you hold to get ahead, this is the operating system that you move from to get ahead, and then he embodying them move forward, and of course over... time that stands in for what being a progressive means because those are the people who are progressives, not not they're not all sociopaths and narcistic maniacs like Obama, they have souls, but they also have false consciousness, and so they adhere to him, because they have like an emotional connection that is not substantiated by like his real, the his real position in the in the in the global exploitosphere, but him at the center, he's fine because he knows real power is always elsewhere, he is happy to just circulate amongst power like a ghost, i've Trump is i've talked about how Trump acts like he's watching himself be president and he isn't president, same thing with obama, he just didn't do it publicly, he did it through like this uh this this literary style, trump does it 140 characters at a time, obama does it with these fucking 700 page doorstops, it's it's just because he's trying to impress someone, he's trying to to fucking impress someone, and that is the essence of the democratic ideology as it exists, it sufuses everyone who went to college and came out with a political idea, whatever it is, not everyone holds it the same, not everyone is obama for god sakes and there are people of good will a part of that hell, i'm part of it, so you can't be completely tainted, if you are then stop listening to me completely, and sure, maybe you think that's the okay, it's fine, but let me just try to express this for the love of god. uh and so their values are Obama, embodied by Obama's life, and now by the politics that he created in in in the in the the the void of the post 2008 uh crisis when we vaporized the economy again and had to refound it and we've created just this quantum economy of pure cash injection of pure liquidity adhering to formations of capital that already exist. in order essentially to to just exchange for its own sake, to pass brief cases back and forth at the end of the global production line, that's what they're there for, the president doesn't have anything to do with that, so it becomes how do you approach the presidency, just as for us, held hostage in this machine, we don't feel like we can do anything about how do we come to terms with this world we're in, and for Obama it is by you know being the most he that he can be. like we all are trying to do, and that's how and that was his presidency, is it created this identity that was creating its antithesis in the non-college uh, i wouldn't say not college educated because a lot of them are college educated, not college house broken people, the people, the majority of them, certainly 2016, less so in 2020, but in 2016, his base was people who went to college were in that middle strata, but instead of absorbing like obama did rejecting it at some level, not completely, not completely, like all these republicans who voted against Trump this time, they adhear to the stuff at the base about the norms meaning stuff and democracy being a real thing and the one man would vote, like they do believe that stuff, they just they stop believing once you get higher than that to like, well racism is real and there's responsibility and you and no, things are the way they are, there's nothing you can really do about it, trying to change things only makes them worse, you just have to try succeed within that rubric, and that's the undergurting logic of of the whole thing, and that's what you learn, but then if you're if you're a liberal, if you have a certain sensibility, you learn on top of that, well that can't change, but we can make things more equitable against race and against uh racial oppression and against gender uh oppression and against class oppression, which is another form of oppression, and they get that gets you to liberalism, that's a bunch, that's like a tower bable that ends with Obama's head on the top, now Trumpism emerging out of just like the the cultural uh you know organization opposed to the thesis that Obama presented in the in the collapse of the Bush administration and the collaps of the economy in 2008, Obama arose as this new thesis in American politics and liberals and democrats and and socialists because how many people who were of age at the time who are now socialists who hate Obama weren't in favor of voting for him at the time when he appeared. I was for Boo Bungler, I didn't see through his lies, I was in a... i was not a child either, i was a voting age, there are a lot of people who would be like, how did you get suckered by Obama, it's like, well, you had to be there, because you had to be there, you had to have absorbed like the the psychic reality, uh, so yeah, I was an old bungler, we all thought there was something there, because what else was there, there was no working class response, working class had been demobilized from a social point of view, and the working this whole demographic slice, and then over the close four years he created an antithesis, this new, this this thing that started among the people went through the machine and said, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, liberal democracy, whatever, uh, whatever keeps the money flowing, but no, fuck all the rest of that stuff and fuck your feelings, and they organized around Trump, and that created a eventual disdain for all the institutions that the that the uh, that the the college absorbs, including the ones that are actually important structurally. but over time because it's all just it's all just a performance, remember this is politics is theater, it just gets sharper and more intense, and by 2016, just like Obama emerged almost out of nowhere to to to smite Hillary and against long odds, Trump did likewise, to embody this new antithesis, which takes all the values that you learn past the basic stuff about this is how the money works, capitalism is bedrock, capitalism is immoval. the stuff that's on top of that that's negotiable because that's the stuff you need to get a job and prosper, which is why people actually go to college as aggregates and not completely, i mean if you talk why people go to college, the motivator is money, that's the thro line of everyone who goes, all the other stuff is built on top of that, and is in fact college kind of advertising itself to people, it's not just about money, it's about this other stuff too, that's like saying you got new features on the fucking latest four by four and so college educated uh uh republican reactionary still wants to make that money still has absorbed that much, but the rest of this, even though it might be like the way that you negotiate changing demographic realities and the and the way that capitalism atomizes social bonds and has to replace them with just more market, which means you have to give up prejudices of all social kinds, you have to give them up in exchange for... money or market participation, market replacing life, market, market decisions replacing individual decisions, turning you into just a circuit, yes, no circuit, and uh, what you see i think with Biden getting the nomination, Biden got the nomination, sort of this, I mean people talk about, I've talked about how Trump is like Louis The II, uh, Napoleon, Louis Napoleon i'm sorry, talking about how... Trump is like Napoleon the Third and like, he's this comic opera uh presence, just bundles in the history because of the inability of like the ruling class to create a politics that can facilitate their disagreements, uh, but it's really Biden, because what happens with Biden is you see in the political sphere, this coalition of people, some of them class conscious in the sense that they are aware that there is capitalism and they like it that way, middle class, the strive, the successful strivers, and then at the bottom end, the people think, no, fuck that stuff too, we do need a revolution, but are still operating from a lot of the other assumptions that they got in college that delute their ability to organize effectively and make them kind of hostage to the democratic party, uh, the people who would say when Bernie Sanders shows up, adhere to him, and then what the what the what the uh, what the uh 20 2020 primary was was a cvil war, basically uh within this emergent, you know, young, diverse, college educated demo, the one that put Obama in power, and then kind of lost interest especially, and didn't really show up for Hillary, uh, but then freaked out because Trump won, and there was a split, you had among the successful, successful, which is like people under the age of 45, who have their own home, it's Pete or uh, maybe Klobachar, uh, or Corey Booker or something, that's not a base, you're not going to win with that, then you had, but you can get a good, you know, but then so basically the rest of it is renters under 45, and then Bernie and Warren kind of split them along, how are you doing otherwise? Are you renting but you have a decent gig, are you renting, but you feel like you're participating in the creative economy in a way that is renumerative to you, both spiritually and economically, are you secure in a way and do you sense security and do you want to maintain security? then you're fucking warren, if you went through that whole rigam role but found yourself uh in a declention, in a social declention or which is the and and like even uh treading water is going downward with debt uh uh expanding the way it is um and they went for they went for uh Bernie but all the... the rest of the voters, the non-college, they're just sitting here, once the first round went and it was clear that all of the. weller off, we're not going to be able to stave off the lower off, they uh freaking panicked, but what sav them is those early results in South Carolina that said, this other hun is all for Biden, because it has nothing to do with this whole argument you guys are having, all the argument, Bernie versus Warren on progressivism, racism and like how do we like uh uh uh reparations? and medicare for all, even even like those things, they are all framed as i think outside of the college bubble as just more politics talk uh all of these things are um they're just passing through like gamma radiation and the only thing that's left is this guy who was there when obama was in and so why would you go with that you could get rid rid of trump why would you want to get rid of trump? this is all rational because all this stuff that's happening is mostly delusion. It's tapping around the fact that the democratic party cannot be moved, and I will say that among those people, I think the burny people, if things had gone differently could have maybe assembled the coalition to push over the coke machine, but as it was, if you don't think Bernie can win and you're and you're not in that, if you're observing that civil war, there's nothing to make you go in for him and not go for the safe hand, which is what they did, and as soon as that happened, you saw the big flight first happened in South Carolina, the the the richest, the the wellest off olds, the ones who are class, the most class conscious, because they they live class, they're for Biden, of course they are, and they see Bernie as a uh, and a lot of them are republicans, they don't even vote democrat, that's how conservative they are, they see Bernie might win, what's the safe hand to stop that? It's biting, and everybody played the safe hand at once. and then once that happened, it snapped the the it broke the fantasy, it broke the fantasy politics that were pervading within the bubble that I was part of, I was in the fantasy, I was ensorceled, it broke that, I was like, oh shit, this race isn't what we thought it was at all, these coalitions aren't what they we thought they were at all, but Bernie was basically fucked at that point, everybody else, the question was, how are they going to make a deal, everybody had a price, and we'll see how well they negotiated, like I think if if Mayor Pete only gets like veterans affairs, I think he didn't do a very good job, i think he had a stronger hand than that, and maybe he's just getting cocky cuz he's so young, he thinks he can just like go, just like start, i don't, i think he's fucking up, or he's uh he's dumber than uh everyone than he thinks he is, which obviously i highly entertain that notion, uh, you know, i don't, we'll see what the club will get, she doesn't seem like a very negot, she's like one those classic people, the reason she beats up her underlings is because she kisses ass everyone who's uh more powerful than her, like that's why. do that because they have to express their frustration somewhere, but they're cowardly kiss assess literally, so she's going to take what they give her, and and she probably already did, and warren of course is either the sucker or uh, or a a chump, no, that's i guess the same thing, i mean just she's either cynical and just got outplayed or she's uh, she is totally uh earnest and is just a fucking moroon. and then that that that like it's like they called a truce and then they subsumed under biden the same way that the fractious bourjois under uh after the 48 revolution in France were eventually subsumed by the figure of Napoleon Ird because they couldn't fucking otherwise agree fucking Orleonis and legitimists and the fucking uh bornapartists he was the one was able to just cut the fuck and oh and the constitutional republicans and the radicals and and the socialists. absorbed it like the fucking plot uh and that and of course you might say well this this prove that like you know these people these are all the work these are uh the new ruling class no these are not real class categories these are essentially uh these are skins you put on in the virtual reality battle drome of politics they are your team jersees when you go play uh like paintball that's what they are and then you go and vote and those votes are cast and those are real elections that are real dogs because it's all the only voice we can hear and so now you've got this democratic coalition, the future of the democratic party unable to resolve its own contradictions because of Bernie because of fucking Bernie's because of how bad things are basically. could not be absorbed, could not absorb bernie, like a fucking uh, like uh, like a piece of grit in a fucking oyster that turns into a pearl or whatever, it was there was... pearls in there, damn it, damn it, and that means that, and this must be stressed, there is a reverse of this politics occurring in the republican party at the exact same time, because there's a lot of these college educated republicans come out, and they still think that they are pursuing some version of the good that isn't being a profit, maximizing goblin, that is not being an instrument of capitalism, they have a sense that they are being alienated, they have that same combination of material pain and guilt that has to be put somewhere, that is inculcated by the college experience, and they have to express it somewhere, and they find enemies and they want to fight them, and as conditions get worse, the enemies are harder and harder to mistake, it is the leviathan of capitalism, that's why we see this acceleration of anti-semitism because you've got to find a alternative explanation, because you're on the right, remember, you still say that the hierarchy is right, and i believe in my position in it and i will defend it, that's you're still observing that. so everything else flows from that, and so you have to get into more and more like contortions to imagine that you're like defending like real culture against an encroaching globo homo like uh uh united nations shit like this is any different than the fucking Johnch society, it's the exact same argument for 1954, but you have to do that to find purchase, to find a reason to care about this stuff, because you know everything good even at your point in the fucking hierarchy is going away, because you probably are renter too, and if you're not, you know your kids are, and you're aware of precarity, except at the very top where you're just making the bet of, oh yeah, the people give me money, give me more money, and man, the people i see talking about how like Donald Trump was a anti-war president, you respond to that, you say he's bombed the hell out of everybody, he escalated bombs over everybody, uh, he's done more drone strikes, uh one term that obama and their response is, yeah, but what would have Hillary done or what do you think Biden's going to do, in this moment, that is indistinguishable from a liberal defending Obama's drone policy, because what would have McCain done, the exact same ideological conditioning tool, and it operates in the same way, which means all that all that righteous, like socially generated, right-wing uh populist energy that people like to jack themselves off exists like this sleeping leviathan of white working class solidarity, when it gets expressed politically, it gets expressed as this stupid uh petty bullshit uh uh fighting about who to blame for what's wrong and it will never get to capitalism because it is entertainment because everybody involved has made the decision that even though they do they say they believe in things and they say they have ideology and they say they're trying to fight for a better future, remember, right wingers think this too, they just have a different idea of what it is, they they oh fuck, ah fuck, i just. It's all a farago, people will choose continuing to pleasure themselves through observing and participating in the social media spectacle of politics as consumer and creator, then do anything that sacrifices their personal pleasure, and I include myself in this, and that is why anything that's going to. come and break up this horrifying stalemate, this awful political situation where we have detached politics from the material completely and absorbed it like we have absorbed the internet as as a replacement for real life and real activity uh is going to come from outside of it and obviously very you know fasily you could say that's means log off and it's like yes the replace time online with time doing almost anything else i can imagine just pure that's clean your room level basic but it's fucking i can't think of any other word for it that is time online is inherently alienated and you have to get that back you have to get that that that experience of being a place because you want to not because it's it's it's uh it's it's a distraction from something not because it's palliative doing something because you want to be doing it and it's never being online and then it's going to be people infusing their relationships with real like love in a way that makes it so that they can't get the pleasure they used to get. out of this because they feel too much what's going on, because our own pain can always be perspectived because we can put it in perspective of what we could lose, even if things get worse for us at every point of the ladder, even if we're exploited more, or alienated more, and remember the rich are alienated more too, in the spiritual sense, it's just that they express their alienation so sadism and ostentacious spectacles of waste because That's all they have, they they have all the guilt, they have none of the pain, so they have to channel it somewhere else, it's the people in the middle who are fucking caught, and the only way to break out of that is to detach your libidinal package of desires, which are mostly created by capitalism, like as in rooting branch like your pituitary development? is like wrapped around a spectacle, a papera spectacle, like you've turned into a, you're turned into a cronenburg creature before you're even, you even get hair on your balls and then you're you, and then that to you is the sum total of good, like we extrapolate all of our abstract ideas about what the best is, what what what's good, what's bad, what love is, what does that even mean? we get them from our own experience of what those things mean. and they are alienated even from ourselves, and only by unalienating time can we unaalienate our relationships, and I'm not saying completely, I'm saying into a degree that can allow us to be where we want to be with who we want to be with, and when you are where you want to be and you are with people who want to be with you, that's where the magic happens, baby, for real baby, I know I'm sounding like Jim Jon Jones right now, but I think that that's true, but of course the thing that makes me not Jim Jones is I don't say the answer to this is follow me to Guiana, the answer to this is to be continued, like that is the end, like one of the things I've been trying to drive at, one of the things that made me hesitate to like write stuff down is I've had a hard time sort of getting to a conclusion that felt meaningful, that felt like it wasn't just passing the buck, and I feel like just that. notion of you know importing import imparting the idea of like what is built in social spaces, which includes people's uh places of work by definition, because that is the engine of their alienation, whether they have a job or not, of course the brutal horror of this is as someone has pointed out is we're all fucking stuck inside a pandemic, we can't even be in with their fucking family members, this is a nightmare and Yeah, it's terrible. This is as bad as it gets in terms of just having all of the social forces like fucking dominoes just pushing against any human connection. And so it really is, it's it's boats against the fucking current, but you got to, you got to do it anyway, you got to do it anyway, sucks. There's no alternative is the thing, we can't, the thing that like brought me to the point of feeling like. I needed to just like rebuild my mental engine is just the recognition that I cannot think myself out of this in any way, in any way that will be satisfying to me spiritually, and if I can't, then I have to find some other place to do that, buse that's where I'm being like, that is the engine driving me towards peace, and I need to instead of ignoring it, I need to engage with it, and and this pseudospectacle of politics allows you to ignore it, allows you to find. principle closer to you than any abstract notion of a greater good that you're operating off of, because there will be no emotion behind it, it will be dry, it will it will be some sort of symbolic logic, and that will never transcend your lived feeling and your desire for pleasure, and your desire to avoid pain. Iron and salt debates, oh that's intriguing, I don't think I've heard of that, is this having to do with warhammer, oh yes, I don't really know anything about ancient China, I should though, I mean if they're the future, I got to find out more about the past. half of the chat is trolling the other half that's doesn't seem like healthy behavior, but it's okay, this isn't either, me doing this is a healthy behavior, none of it's healthy behavior, my god, i don't want to read heideger, that sounds boring, i feel like i just kind of get the gist of it, isn't that true with all those philosophical concepts, kind of just get the just in terms of like your day-to-day reasoning, you read the books, i've read some of these books man, folks, i've read the books, the like the texture of the argument doesn't hold you beyond the reading of it, you end up just with like these placeholders, unless you're going to every time you're engaged with the issue, stop and re-read it, you're not going to do that, so what you're really operating off of is the echo, everyone's operated off of just this like echo located socially distorted version of a thing they remember reading, the impact of a piece of reading, a piece of work on us is the degree to which having read it changes us in our daily behaviors and patterns. and outlook in a repeatable way, in a self-reinforcing, positive feedback loop, as an engine, as an engine of of of presence, of mindfulness as awful as that word is, and as cheapen by capitalism as it is become, as all concepts are, like the thing is is all the ideas we talk, all the words we say, you know, like when we talk about religion and politics, we talk about values, we talk about thing like socialism or... Christianity, these things only have mean, these has these things have a symbolic meaning and they have an emotional meaning, and the more socially attenuated your existence is, the less your the meaning of like the symbols you use is grounded in an experiential an experiential communion with other people, the more they are merely symbolically or logically convincing, which means that when you get into a conflict. between resolving a question towards answering it or resolving a and therefore having to maybe do something you don't want to do and just keep having it because that's more fun even and it's filling up the same psychic slot in your head towards political action and political activism and political self-fulfillment you're going to pick that and that includes me that's why i made a fucking podcast because it was easier and it was more fun and it will always be more fun and easy to post and the sacrifice has to be has to come not from a logical proposition that you pose yourself, has to come from a place of dare i say it, love, where the love is transcendent of your individual sense of consciousness, where your ego has been produced in your calculation of value, that's the John brown spirit i am talking about where you are, it was not the violence that he carried out that mattered really, that was a tactic, it mattered was that he was willing to sacrifice himself. with actual efficacy in a way that others weren't. um, I've said this before, but John Brown was the synthesis of the two strains of anti-slavery uh politics that emerged in the anabelum, American North. You had abolitionism, middle-class phenomenon, center in cities like Boston, of doiled bored rich people who saw slavery as a moral horror. which boiled down to, boiled down to, because they're still participating in the system and they don't really challenge its ability, it it in any meaningful way, because they don't operate from any awareness that or desire to to abolish class anyway, uh, that boils down to impolight impolightness, it's a moral horror, but but it's because it's it's gross. i'm not saying the people these people weren't good, i'm not saying that they didn't operate out of pure hearts, but like their pure hearts were wrapped around. definition of good of morality that was dessacralized by the experience of being a middle class urban urbanite and it was replaced with this abhorance and manners. now in the in the in the butternut north and in the urban tenaments of the Irish, mostly Irish urban rabel, there was and although less with them because they were clients of the Democratic Party, the the non-uh Irish urban workers, the non catholics, the non-taminized ones, who were like there were plenty of mechanics were anti slavery, were free soil, and then of course the almost the whole of the omenry across the whole northern tier were eventually as the issue became more prominent, more committed to anti-slavery, because they saw it as a material a material threat to their way of life, a competition, a labor competition in which they were at a disadvantage and which would lead them. for their children to end up in a situation where they would of course have to either be naster of slave and being a small holder with no capital, likely to become a fucking slave. and what this meant was is that these two movements, they had different approaches to the question of overposing slavery. uh, the abolitions had a general theory of moral swasion, like that was the garissonian school, proslitized the awfulness of slavery, and eventually people will realize how horrible what is because of the power of our oratory, and it will make them. stop doing it, and of course they thought that and they thought it deeply, but what was underneath even their understanding is that the real reason they didn't they thought that is because they didn't want to get their hands dirty, they lived nice lives, they did not feel precarious, they did not feel threatened by slavery, they did not feel the daily pain of alienation of being a fucking backbreaking yoman trying to uh like pay off a a mortgage to some fucking bank out east or or a toiling uh urban mechanic? They had real problems to worry about, so the abstract pain of somebody else wasn't any more real to them than it was to the northern uh abolitionist, and so their anti-slavery was basically just vote Wigg and then over time vote Republican, like vote for just like, I don't, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm not going to do that, but if there's a choice, more slavery, less slavery, I'm going to vote less slavery, let me also happen, then of course the... the south says oh yeah no we're going to get rid of the union like oh i guess we got to throw hands and out of that out of the war anti-slavery sentiment became real because the bloodshed and the experience of it actually made it real but before that it wasn't there what consecrated that fucking what catalyzed that opposition to slavery which was attenuated because it was divided in a way that the southern pro- slavery aristocracy was completely undivided was john brown fusing the real I mean this guy was miserable, he was he, he made attempts at being a - a a a speculator like a lot of people did in the Ohio, the the um the Ohio River Valley, I believe or the the western reserve uh and he speculated on land, but he uh was ruined by the 1930 1836 panic, thank you Martin van Buren, Martin Van Ruin more like it, and he uh was broke the rest of his life, he was constantly hounded by debters. hounded by debters, he was in court all the time, he went to fucking England on a Kakime scream to manipulate the wool market and ended up eating shit and owing everybody money, he was, he was always uh on someone else's tender hook, he was as close a thing, even though he like had his own property and he had farms that he worked, either like gifted to him by Garret Smith or owned out right before they were taken from him, uh, he was working for other people even in that capacity uh, and he was always tenuous, but his uh, and so he had the... manner and and the willingness to take questions to the extremity posed by his own suffering, he also lost, he lost 11 of his 20 children, i believe in childhood, or or dying before him, including a number of them were killed in his war against slavery, either with him at Harper's beforehand in Kansas, fred for example, he was like real human, like real experience consecrated his pain, his he expressed it towards an institution that was offensive to the human spirit at a level that only he really could sense because of the wealth of his the depth of his pain and his connection of that pain to the pain of others. that spiritualized understanding that the swells in Boston said they had mouth, but for most part at the end of the day didn't really believe because remember these guys weren't really Christians for the most part, they were unitarians by this point. they were all like emersonian transcendentalists, they were their their faith was weak t, they did believe in the brotherhood of man, but they were ideas as they are to us now, like these were our predecessors, uh, and uh, like this is the favorite class, this is the buffeted, costted favored like middle strata class that's like born born up through uh the tides of history until now at which point that the thing is capsizing. but on like on the bedrock was their they're wanting to preserve their comfortable position. Brown had no comfortable position, so his moral horror slavery was and his religious horror slavery was a live wire, it was grounded to a well of real pain that was connected to him and his family and his the people he love the most, and that drove him to break a stalemate that was always being settled on the side of slavery because the slavers wanted it more. they were on the precipice of winning uh the the... there by because it's there is no uh social opposition to it, at least in wherever planter economies were hegemonic, they were hegemonic in the creation of the entire social order around them, and the alienation of the small holder uh of the south, the white small holder of the south was as ideologically ensnared as it was in the north, just towards the planter position, and there was no real opposition. like southern unionism didn't even really like cohere until very late in the sectional crisis because it didn't seem like it was really going to happen until that point and John Brown was the one one northerner who was willing to put the fucking bet down and say i am willing to sacrifice this might not work because the reason the north kept backing down is because the only way to win was to risk and why risk because nobody's really that concerned like even the... northern opposition to slavery in in like you know the the non-middle-class sphere uh was um was firming up, but you know you could also let things go. John brown wasn't going to let anything go, and the violence all flowed from that, and you can question the tactical necessity of it, but you cannot question the morality, it's more moral than anything any of us have ever done. and I think even tactically you got to say it worked, you know, they hang him in 195 1859, within two years, the guy who sentenced in to hang was in a federal jail after having been taken off the uh CSS Trent trying to go to negotiate with the British, the world can turn upside down, but you're not going to live to see it, and or in realistic terms because we're not in that moment, we're not in that apocalyptic moment, we're at. very wordt a basic level of like building even you know like the the the rudaments of a social consciousness to to operate out of uh so there's no need for that kind of thing, there does no need to be willingness to sacrifice in terms of just letting go of some passibility for personal selfish pleasure which is always going to be more real and i am as implicated by this as anyone and i hope that i can find a a place to put that energy and feel like I'm doing something with it, but yeah, I mean, I'm certainly not blaming anybody for not doing it, and certainly not now, when we are literally all being told to, unless you're being compelled by the market to run around like a fucking uh, jerbal in a habit trail, delivering things to people, or or risking your life staffing grocery stores and stuff, you got to stay home, so nobody has any position to do anything other than just be compelled either to ignore things by by distracting oneself or just being distracted by... the brutal reality of having to you know work 15-hour shifts or whatever the fuck people have to do now and the degree to which we can distract ourselves is the degree to which we're not going to feel that enough to push out of ourselves and that's why logging off is the first and most important step. all comes back to this is be nal as it is. it's like the hope is that with each circuit like you intensify the feeling around the thought so that... that when you think it, you think it more powerfully than you thought it before, you're amplifying, you're like charging it with psychic energy, you're you're, you're ensceling it, you're giving the word or the phrase and actual like psychic energy, and that happens through repeated like reafffirmations of the truth of it and the necessity for it, that's what I think I'm doing with these. is, I hope it's having some echoing effect on those who listen, but I don't know, obviously all of my reasonings related to my life are filtered through the same thing, and as much as I say that I'm trying to build a sense of love that goes beyond myself, I am certainly not there, I certainly struggle with the desire to just listen to the fully strug, I mean I went a long time operating on autopilot that way, and so I'm still, I'm bucking a lot of programming, and so all my reasoning this way might very well be like, and yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know what, right now you really can't do anything, but I got to say right now, I really don't know what I can do, like as in there's a virus going, but one of these days this thing is going to stop, and I hope that the people we have used this time wisely, is I guess what I would say, is that we have used this time, if we have it, and a lot of people don't, and that's terrible, but if you have it, use it wisely, whatever that means cannot be. described because at that point you're just operating off of some flimsy ricky bullshit ideological construct that's really just designed to like improve your take position in the cl sphere, it's not based on anything more than just motivated reasoning and selfishness. But if anybody, I mean I have not used my time, I've used my time better than I could have, in the worst case, I certainly know it hasn't been as good, but that's okay, it's finding the, it's just knowing that you're trying, it's knowing what you're trying, it's just not letting it run on autopilot, buse that's the danger, it just sucks time away from you, and that time doesn't just go away, time is alienated and that time that alienation has to be recooped somewhere, that pain has to be vented somewhere, and the more you're there, the more you're going to want to stay there to keep venting it, because that's the only other way you can do it, and if you are working, use the time at work wisely, once again, what that means, you're there, I'm not there, I couldn't fucking tell you, why would I propose, my god, what a presumptuous asshole I would have to be to make any presumption, just wisely, just being aware. mindful, yes, that'l be $5.99, get it on a fucking mug, I know, this is all commodified fucking pablom, I know, then this is David Foster Wallas style, fo self-deprecation as a ratorical turn, yes, what about it, did it makes sense cuz the standpoint at the end of the day, cannot be attained, anyone interacting with any text cannot attain this. point of the person to expressed it, which means they'll never be able to weigh their heart against the feather as they go into a anubus's layer. so yeah, it's it's a very tough place to find yourself at any end of this, it's very alienating, i mean it's literally. alienating, it's accelerating alienation, it's because I really do feel like every like not just talk about labor, I feel like every hour spent online as a concept, like when I say online, I mean social media, I mean uh, not all cases of gaming or uh, or uh, watching films, but most of them, definitely all uses of it for pornography, none of this is sin, none of this is. all of this is necessary, but that amount of time that can be defended to it is so elastic, there's so much stretch in those fucking jeans that if you just let it go long enough, you will find yourself lost, and i have, i've been lost doing that basically my whole life, and i i greet, i look back and i'm like, man, so many places i made mistakes, so many, where could i have been if if i don't xy or different. but the thing that I remind myself is that I'm only here because all that happened and I have no idea what the fuck could have occurred, what kind of catastrophes could have intervened, how I would have responded to to the to the starcastic uh terror of life in a body, and all that time is alienated, and it it makes us unhappy because it's not what we want to be doing. win and like I'm saying that's alienation is at the base, you're not doing what you want to be doing, and of course what is want, but we're I think that want is so deform that even doing what you think you want to be doing is not doing what you want to be doing, if that makes sense, I think come on, that makes sense right, because what you want to be doing, it's just programming, it's the just, it's just the options presented to you, here's the one you want, it's like when they gave the uh, they gave. the different magazine covers to Eric Trump and he got to pick one, that's what his job at the Trump news magazine, and they go, and we really like this one, and they put it towards him, he goes, that's the one, and then that is what we want, I was like, yeah, we want it, we wanted, no one's, I'm not going to deny anybody's lived experience, but we wanted as consolation, we wanted as spirific, we wanted his balm for an underlying injury, which is unaddressed, and and fucking weep puss and that has to be expressed somewhere and one where it can be is to turn all of those bad feelings into into spectaclized amusement and in politics, this is where it all comes together, in politics the inflictment of pain, the vicarious infliction of pain on others, people that are responsible for why things are bad, things bad, they cannot be changed, because we cannot change them because we cannot operate out of anything others in self-interest, we are the homo economicas that the fucking Chicago boys made us, we cannot break this program. and as such we are doomed, whose fault is this? and the trump people say it's use fucking Jews in your fucking fancy talk, all the guys making us feel bad about just being uh kings, about making that money, all you're negging little fucking chirpers, chirpy chirping, your fault, you got you threw off our fucking aim, we were vibing and you fucked it up, of course the democratic the broad democratic responses, no it's it's you racist misoginist. male white male demons, you yakubian monsters, you are the ones who poison the fucking uh garden, not Eve, and so we will array our politics around using this machinery of state that is dishing out the misery of neoliberalism at an accelerating rate, it's going to try to direct it towards our enemies, that will be the sum of politics until it is interrupted. from below and from without and from within as people like opped out and burst away from this thing, I have not read Cory Robin's book on Clarence Thomas, I have to say I am a big fan of Cory Robin, just want to buse someone mentioned him, uh, I think one of the very few. legacy left establishment media people who understood the Trump uh era at all, they just people seem to just like people who have a real grasp of every moment until that just like his his election short circuit their brain, rick pearlsteen is an example of this, his books are great, reganland's fantastic, he fucking put in oh you know what he did, he got that greg gumbo, he got that culture, oh he got that culture over there, oh you know that culture is good, oh yeah he got that list of all them uh book the month club mean selections there, oh you going to slap your mama, that's some good stuff right there, oh what's that? oh yeah, but then over here he's got them politics, oh yeah, you got that nixon in there, you got that Regan, oh yeah, you got that those guys that those conventions causing all that rock is, oh that's good, but what's this, he going to bring some political economy in there, oh my god, this stu is off the chain, slap your mama, but he just like, even though he wrote stuff like reading up to trump about like yeah, this is a this thing's a whole giant marky level marketing scheme and it's a bunch of people ripping each other off and that's the whole core of it. Trump shows up and it's just like he frits out like he was freting about like how we were going to have war in the streets on election day it's like do you not get that this whole thing is transactional this thing is too transaction to allow for an ideological contest these guys are all just selling each other time shares you just can't apply it because he was too enthrolled to the drama of the norm breaking he was too invested with the norms Cory Robbins like he was like, yeah, no, I get this, because like obviously uh, uh, reactionary mind is on point, I think largely, there's stuff you might quible with, but I think his general, his his general turn of is very accurate, and then his his diagnosis of Trump uh, has been very good, and like his main emphasis has been that like Trump as policy maker is basically powerless and was the entire presidente, and that was always true, and if he is policy maker is powerless, then all the questions about him being a fascist and his are essentially ornamental because even if he was, he couldn't do anything about it, and that I think that like like first principle for him, I think it allowed him to not get carried away with a lot of nonsense, they got other people carried away because they didn't have that grounding of, yeah, no, these guys are these guys are all fucking scamming each other, uh, and and his whole thing about like seeing Trump as a disjunctive president, the way that like Carter was uh and predicting very early on that he wouldn't get reelected uh that I think sort of fell apart towards the end of the term with the COVID and everything and Biden getting the nomination. I think that like a lot of that was predicated on the assumption that Bernie would emerge as like a counter as like a as a Regan style antithesis like a new a nemesis to the current system like a nemesis to to like the degraded conservative uh decadent conservative. uh ruling class, but then that didn't emerge, we got Biden instead, uh, and so I think that the grounds, the grounds are febral now, for something, something moreus than that to emerge, but it's not here yet, and I appreciate that he doesn't go crazy uh trying to ring the damn bell all the time, just because everyone's got a goddamn uh soccer on their neck and they're jacking off to this stuff, there's an autoerotic quality to all speculations of purges and cous happening and and stealing the election, because if they stole the election, that means that buse you say, what's going to stop them? okay, take that logic seriously, why are you scared, why are you worried? what are you fretting about? you literally are describing a fat accomplie to the point of metaphysical certainty. so what are you actually scared of? i would submit that you are not really scared of anything, you're scared the way that somebody in a movie theater is scared watching the blare witch project. that is what i would say, and of course. people get mad at you because they'll say that you're denying their lived experience, and that is one of the mystifying horrors of of this current moment, this cultural turn, this this like autoimmune system kick in as capitalism gets more and more extractive and and the superstructure has to find new and impressive ways to explain it away, your lived experience doesn't really mean anything because it is not yours, you are a constitutive of an entire matrix of ideological formation that tear apart your very... idea of ever even imagining yourself a unified being that could express a desire or have a point of view only through the the accumulation of these things lived experience at the at the at the population level can there be grased any sort of uh intelligible pattern, you filter out all the bullshit, you filter out the bullshit, and that is what comes from math. organizing which you know that's easy to say but it's still the only thing we're going to get and a lot of people say a lot of arguments online really boil down to like how do we get that mass movement? it's like yeah you can't plan your way there because this mechanisms are broken but if it emerges like i said that's that's how it's going to emerge we are all in fact contradictions that are resolving ourselves and that's why you're never sitting still and all that time online is not just you're it's like, it's like you're doing a fucking, you're you're solving a bitcoin, you're you're you're mining bitcoin in there, you're you're mining like social bitcoin, you're getting your you're getting your little fragment of clot that you can exchange, I'm doing it too, and I'm doing better, I'm I'm one of the winklevosses of the social bitcoin clot, but meanwhile your fucking computer is heating your room and filling the atmosphere with fucking uh toxic goddamn gas, you're literally cooking the earth to solve sedokus or hang out in the fucking waiting room, which is what we're doing, we're... around in the waiting room of western civilization, the or the waiting for like doa to get called, yes Cory Robin, I like it, indeed, I would like to read the clar Thomas book because I think does make sense, like people think, people have a very hard time analyzing him, and I think that Robin's, from what I've read some articles and exerts, I i i broadly get him as saying like, Clarence Thomas is a black nationalist, Clarence Thomas is operating off of coherent political objectives and theories that arise from an acceptance of a racial pessimism, an acceptance that there can be no uh, non uh multiracial democracy. He believes that, he believes like afropessimism, but he also believes a lot of other stuff and built up together, it turns into his political ideology, his uh, his political ideology expressed through his to uh, his uh, is judicial decisions and votes. but yeah i realized i'm just Howard Beal now yelling turn it off right before the commercial break and they bring out uh jozy the fucking psychic and we do vox populy and then i get murdered by uh by epic mouse zoomers, i mean we could literally just do a remake with my life if that's how it ends, but honestly anything that does end it would probably be like similarly fitting and absurd. yeah, like the thing about that that network shit is that you got to take it all the way, and if you take it all the way. all the way, so like, no, all of this is entertainment, like everything that doesn't directly uh, everything that doesn't directly connect to you, your sustentenance as a person, your your... for tearing from the earth's bounty your ability to sustain yourself and your family members everything that isn't that in this social order at the end point of the conveyor belt of the global economy, the big open mouth at the end of the thing, homer simpson eating the fucking uh uh hot uh eating the fucking donnut in hell that means it's all just pleasure because we have a baseline uh uh protec protection from the worst of full emiseration and you say yeah, but like there are so many people in this country who that's not true of, correct, but they aren't part of the we, they're not part of our body politic in the way that we conceive of it, they're not participating in it, because they have been let go, because the way we normalize is by when horror happens, we localize, we cut it off and we just... create a new class of people who are no longer within the continuum of our moral consideration, not at the same level, even if we feel for them, we feel for them at an abstraction, at a distance that we don't feel for people who are closer to us, in a sense of citizenship, and that's because the more we feel their pain, the more we can't distract ourselves, so we have to damp it, we're not doing it on purpose, it's our spiritual sense, our our antenna, our dam out of self-protection, because if we didn't, if we could feel it, we could feel the real declination of people, just the people around you in a city, the people around you in a town, the people that make up the country that you live in, the people make up the world you live in, you would not be able to indulge in the compensatory spectacle observation and engagement that we are all doing. Okay, I feel like this was a breakthrough, I feel like this was a good one, I got real down low here, got to the gritty, I realize though, a lot of people are going to say, you sound crazy, I realize that now, and I know people tell me, don't worry about it, but I'll say right now, I'm not worried about it, I know you got to do this sometimes, you got to find the extension of your ability to express things in symbols and other people's ability to figure out what you mean, like you need to know if you're translatable, if you're operating at a level. translation and if you're not you got to slow down and so i i welcome the feedback certainly all right guys peace.
