 I can follow somethings that are promises, slow down, you move too fast, got to make the morning last. just kicking down the cobblestones looking for fun and feeling bruvy feeling groovy feeling groovy feeling groovy hello lamp post what you knowing come to watch your power flowing ain't you got no rimes for me feeling groovy. Oh yeah, oh no, I thought I changed the setting in. there i can change that now though, oh i forgot the class, oh boy, that work, was i able to update it, yes i was able to update it, haha, look at me, look at me hacking the the gibson, i hacked the damn gibson, oh i can't play any shooting fast games, they're too scary, i know people make fun of me for that, but it's not so much that i'm actually scared, i am a adult, it's that it just, I mean it's meant to make you feel in some way attacked, I mean that's how you know what to do, who your enemies and your allies are in the game, and that's just a, that is a bad vibe, that's all there is to it, it's just a bad vibe, I think, it's not that I'm actually afraid of getting murdered, but you know, video game fans have to say things like that to justify that. frankly childish obsessions, because they know as much as anybody who is addicted to the worst aspects of our mass culture, no that it's all gruel, it's all bad for you, it's as spiritually carcinogenic as the uh mass marketed food stuffs are literally carcinogenic, physically carcinogenic, but you don't want to hear it, because who wants to hear that? but i understand i'm addicted to a bunch of carcinogens and we're all going to cancer spiritually and physically, but that's okay, because we all every moment of our lives have a chance to stop doing that, we really do, that's what I know more than anything, is that and that's why even though I really do think that looked at objectively, human civilization is doomed in the medium term, and all hopes of revolution are doomed in the in any term, I i think that that is what the objective reading. conditions will tell you, but that is just the determinant to determine skeleton of the past, that's just what people did up until now and are going to do, and all we can do is base make base our assumptions on what people are doing now and what people are valuing now and how people are living now, and that's the only way we can, but and that's that's the only way we can create a consensus around understanding the moment, because it's us to filter out any of our emotional truth, which is based on like, spiritual conceptions, we have to filter that out, we have to, it's inevitable, and what it does is it shows you a a determined structure that is doomed us, but and if you look at it with a dead heart and you try to reason your way to a motivation to fight for anything in the future, if you reason your way you won't be able to do it, because there's nothing to convince the brain, what there is is the fact that there is one other fact that is ignored by this, which is every human heart, every human brain is running all day, we're all running on programming, we're all running according to conditioning, but we are also feeling, we are feeling as we are doing that, and that means that we have with every encounter with the world we have, there is a chance for us to have an emotional response to that moment that makes... the world we're in different, makes us perceive the world in a different way and allows us to act from different motivations and the ones that have been imprinted on us. by the culture, the superstructure, that is determined by an economic series of relations, does to our brain, and that means that there in every moment is the opportunity for anything to happen, including uh, the full redemption of the human race, because it's made up of humans, and you have to live it subjectively, you can't look at it. at a dry uh description, because the dry description lacks the an entire half of human experience, which is emotional truth, which is what gives birth to spiritual understandings of the world that allow you to operate from different emotional engines, orient yourself around different conceptions of good and bad, because what looks like the end of humanity only looks that way because we're talking about a... that has been determined over time and has been overdetermined through every reinforcing victory of capitalism in world history, a um a simulus response nexus where the on where the vast majority of people, no matter what they think they believe in, are operating in every moment from a narrow, pleasure, pain, decision tree determined not by what is what what pleasure? pain is in a human context, in a human species context, in a global, like organic context, in a narrow individual pleasure sense, pleasure and pain receptor sense, the thing that it reinforces our illusion that we are separate, and that we have separate interests and that we need to have things like capitalism, in order to bring our separate interests together and negotiate them and and work through them. we did, we did have to find humanity through this process of individualization, but now we've reached the point of maximal atomization where we have to transition back to a collective understanding of human value, and if you have a collective understanding of human value, you are oriented toward a pleasure that is not personal pleasure and a pain that is not personal pain, and that allows for the sort of... sacrifice and the sort of commitment that we don't have now and that is not dominated the modern uh left-wing and populist movements for the simple reason that the sufficient globalized consciousness and technological sophistication to allow for that hadn't happened, we had to get here and now we're here. and that means that we every moment have the freedom to try to find connection and if we do find it for able to maintain a psychic connection to others that that we that breaks up the individuated cycle of self-love and self-lothing that drives us towards indulgence and away from reality uh if we break that up then we can act from different principles we can ac differently, which means that the structural conditioning that has doomed us to participate in this slow wind down of human existence into annihilation can be interrupted, but only for us and that and but the important thing is that even if if it's for you, then the fact that the structure looks impregnable, the fact that it looks like there is no hope, it doesn't matter, because winning no matter matters, no longer matters, you're not. you're not worried about personally surviving, you're not worried about your line or legacy or your world impact being positive, you're just trying to act for what you understand emotionally to be a greater good. I mean, I'm not going to say that I feel that way all the time, I largely don't, but I understand that it's there, and I understand that if I have it in mind when I'm like caught in any kind of decision crisis that I can use it to push through. and not be left to despair and be paralyzed by my surrender to my selfishness, and if you feel that way, and you can you can look at this structure, this this determined machinery that is inextricably bound to lead to the annihilalation of the human race and all of life on this planet, you can enliven it with... because you know in yourself that you can act differently and feel differently than you did, you can look at the person that you thought you were and what you thought was possible and say: 'Oh, I am no longer that person. I mean, obviously we're always changing, we're never the same person, but there is a the fantasy of the self is a fantasy of continuity, and when you have an emotional spiritual experience, you can look back and see the discontinuity and recognize that person is not really you, in a real sense, and that means that you are now a different person, and that means you live in a different reality, and that means that the the the uh overdetermined doom around you is possibility, because if enough people'. will act from a species understanding, from connection to from a spiritualized desire to re, bring back together the human race, then you will be able to change all of this shit, the only reason, the reason it looks doomed is not because of any of the actual technological, physical structures that we've done to this planet, it's not even the global warming that's poisoning us, that's setting the clock, but none of that is determining our fate. We are determining our faith because we are allowing these structures to push us forward towards are half-hearted deaths, because we can't conceive of doing anything other than seeking our own pleasure. We cannot imagine anything meaning anything to us more than that, and so we can only try to put off thinking of death by indulging in the moment and then feeling bad about the indulgence, or if we're of a... different cast of mind if we're if we're a descendant of puridas like many of us are, not even engaging in yourself in pleasure, but in ritually abstaining from pleasure, in in in hording virtue, as Catherine Lewis said, either way, you are, you are operating from a a ant's understanding of of free will, everything that is not forbidden is compulsory, and if we're all operating from that, doom is inevitable. but if we know for a fact there are people always you don't operate that way and that even if we operate that they most of the time there are moments when our humanity kicks in and we could at every moment conditions can change because we can never predict specifically how conditions will change in such a way to unleash a spiritual explosion a a chain reaction of spiritual enlivenment and awakening that changes. is the axis of earth and puts you in a different timeline, a timeline where all that stuff that looked in the rearview mirror like capitalism settling its tendrils around the human humanity's throat, the the terminator bringing itself into skynet working itself to fucking consciousness so they can annihilate everything, it doesn't look like that anymore, it looks like oh this is what had to happen for us all to be able to know one another. We couldn't sheer geography and time kept humanity for the vast majority of its existence, from truly understanding itself to be a species. Technology, while it has alienated us from one another through through capitalist dominion over, the capitalist algorithm of of profit literally stripping our souls, but it has also brought us into closer connection to each other and better able to... to conceive of abstracted humans, strangers as people as things we are, we can recognize now in a way thanks to that technology in a way we never could before, and that means that all that stuff that look like it's capitalism killing us, it was actually capitalism allowing us to to awaken to our death. but that's only if you feel that change in yourself, if you feel that that change is possible by knowing it happened to you, you can't reason your way there, you can't and reason them, no, I am not all or nothing on technology, I've never been all or nothing on technology, that would be absurd, like if the Unibomber had a podcast, I've just said that I have tried to highlight the specific. way that capital that technology has been used to strip us fully of our humanity, but it's also connecting us the way that it was promised to, as always, culture becons us with the liberatory potential of technology, which exists while hiding that the hidden, the invisible hand of capitalism that is going to bend it towards its will. so anyway that's all the way of talk of setting up an introduction to the last two chapters of Eric Fanner's reconstruction, a era that it seems... especially if you read the last two chapters to have been determined. America's combination of freeland in the west, uh, subjection to uh, a London-based global trade order, hugely important, uh, um, and just good old fashion American racism, which was generated by uh, by the realities of the casted labor of the south, meant that it couldn't have gone. differently, but that's because we're looking at it uh, we're looking at a failure of spirituality, we're looking at a failure of of the heart, and so of course it looks like it could have been any other way, but I think we've talked in the pat going through this book, points where there could have been difference, and and I do really think Benjamin Butler succeeding Abraham Lincoln is a thing that could have significantly shifted the direction of America's. development, not in a way that would have put us in some flying car utopia right now, but in a much in a, it is possible to imagine a less dire moment, and and and there is a reality, there is a possible of a world that is not this dire, and even if it's still dire, and even if we were all if we were there now, and that other world does exist, of course, the people there now are also feeling miserable and hopeless, probably and like capitalism is doomed, unless of course you know they're in the middle of the grand reckoning that would have been kicked off by... the crisis of capitalism in the early 19th 20th century, the one uh marx predicted, like marx's crisis of capitalism happened, it happened from 1914 to 1945, and capitalism won, that and we've had to deal with that ever since, maybe that goes differently, who knows, it's all stuff I'd like to talk about in some form, I really do want to do a lot with the idea of an alternative civil war just as like. a ritual practice for myself to imagine differences, to imagine uh moments where that passion that is born of recognition overwhelms. there's a section here uh in, i don't have it, i didn't write it down unfortunately, there's a section in this part of the book where it talks about Benjamin butler uh giving a speech on the house floor, maybe i can find it online on behalf of... the uh civil rights act of i believe 1875 or 1877 uh and in it he talks about how he was a uh all right let me see hold on a second i got to see if i can find it. Talk amongst yourselves while I find this. This is not good radio, I'm sure. sorry, i'm very sorry about this, i really want to find it though, damn it, i should have written down, i did a terrible job, guys, sorry, okay, i think i found it, here it is, Okay, I find it. All right, so he's describing a uh, a civil war battle that included black troops, uh, and it was a uh violent affair that saw a lot of dead, uh, 500 uh uh, black troops died in this battle, uh, and here it goes, so he's describing it, it's it's happened, uh, they fight, they die, uh, the north, I believe wins the battle, uh, and then Butler says this: there in a space not wider than the clerk's desk and 300 yards long lay the dead bodies of 543 of my colored comrades fallen in defense of their country who had offered up their lives to uphold its flag and its honor as a willing sacrified and as I rod along among them guiding my horse this way and that way lesst he should profane with his hooves what seemed to me the sacred dead and as I looked on their brown. faces upturned in the sining shining sun to heaven, as if in mute appeal against the wrongs of the country for which they had given their lives, and whose flag had only been to them a flag of stripes on which no star of glory had ever shown for them, feeling I had wrong them in the past, and believing what was the future of my country to them, among my dead comrades, there I swore to myself, a solemn oath, may my bright hand forget its cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I ever failed to defend the rights of these men who have given their blood for me and my country, this day and for their race forever, and God helping me, I will keep that oath. Now of course, that's demagogory and fluster. and blummery uh and he was a politician looking to uh make a name for himself, but he and he was a croook and he was a uh spoilsman, but he also fought in a battle and saw people die in front of him, with him for a cause, and I don't know why you can't explain his career, the most the easiest way to explain his career, a guy who was a... copperhead democrat who voted for the south uh democratic candidate John brekkenridge in 1860 to becoming a radical republican uh defender of black liberty the rest of his career, even though he was a congressman from Massachusetts who very easily could have maintained his career by uh kissing the ass of the Irish, which he did. and who by the way, we're not terribly interested in uh lifting a finger to save uh ex- slaves. Benjamin butler, fascinating character, I'm gonna, I think, I'm gonna take a break, I said from doing the reading club after this week, uh, I'm still gonna we'll do. another one, like I said, I might not want to do uh reconstruction again, but we'll we'll see, uh, I'll take requests, but I really want to read his autobiography, I'm very excited about it, he wrote a book and it's called Butler's book, which is a great name, his father was a pirate, all right, so while I was talking about how you know things could have been. different, most of the real moments of difference are at the beginning of the war, are at the beginning of reconstruction, like i said, you put Butler in there after Lincoln with a absolute willingness to confiscate southern land, to defend the rights of former slaves at gunpoint, maybe you change the dynamic, specifically the economic dynamic whereby black rights are protected not by the sufferance of the north, but by a black political power, express through land ownership, real possibility, but uh, any chance of things to be different was, I think largely dead in our timeline by uh, the 1873, because it was, I, I would argue, the 1873 panic in the economy, which is what they used to call recessions or depressions, panics, the panic of 1873, which led to to the most prolong, it's it was called the great depression until we had a worse one, uh, it's a um, it was 65 months of economic contraction, the longest in American history, uh, and it meant that reconstruction was domed, uh, that was, that put the nail in the heart, talk about racism, racism of course is a huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge problem, the economic interests of northern uh finance capital hugely problematic, the liberal ideology of the Republican Party leadership, all problematic, but nothing uh was worse than uh the collapse of the economy, the collapse of the economy made all those things uh insurmountable in another economic context, they might have been, they might have been, and I think we've talked a bit about ways that you see alternative thing, alternative structures emerge, that in a great in a more robust economic environment, which was totally possible, this stuff, these things were always man-made, they were always decisions by finance to maintain control of the money supply, that was what led to every sustained recession and depression before uh, was World War II. So this man-made, this total shoot, shoot yourself in the... but economic collapse which was started when somebody wouldn't when people just like what happens with all these ponzi schemes which is what all American history is all American economic history is ponzi schemes the uh manifest destiny the jeffersonian conception of yoman freedom is a ponzi scheme because it always scerns it always assumes more in that formulation land because remember you don't have one kid in this time you don't have one kid nobody has one kid and then that one kid keeps the land that they live on, people have populations get bigger, people immigrate, which means that if everybody to be a yoman farmer, there has to always be more land, there has to be, and everything is built on that premise, and all of our financial instruments and all of our economic activity and America has ever had has been built on that premise of infinite growth, and these ponzi schemes all collapse when the... inputs fail and the uh railroad boom of the post war era was entirely generated by a cycle of uh of inflated stock offerings by these under these uh railroad companies that had no cash flow no none of them were making money what they were doing was printing stock and then they would sell new stock and then use that to buy to pay off dividends to the old stock, but it was okay because there was always more money going in, because the railroads were the chosen method of economic expansion during that period, because remember the civil war starts this big explosion in uh capital capacity, it has to go somewhere, it went to railroads and there's plenty of land to do it, but the thing is there's not necessarily that much money because a lot of these railroads went to nowhere, nobody was on them and they didn't do the and they ended up becoming um giant white elephants, but it was okay because you could always sell more stock and then use that stock sale to get more uh to get dividends for existing investors so that they'll buy more stock, well eventually you put some out and people are like, look, it's already elsewhere, we are it started actually in Europe because at this point the United States is still not. the center of the global economic, the capitalist machinery, it's still Europe, so it starts in Europe, but once Europe stops sending money over here, once Europe stops investing in these bonds, people start calling it in and the whole thing collapses uh, and it about, it took se till 78 to bottom out and it still it still kept going uh from there, what this led to is a price drop among other things i mean obviously huge. loss of employment, people lost their land and their homes because of a giant drop in prices uh in all sectors and this ruined agricultural uh small farming and this led to the creation of the grange uh which was a farmers cooperative union first started out in the west, it moved throughout the country, it also lent that urban laborers started to get more militant and started to organize uh and to demand more of capitalism, and this led the urban middle class who had been the and always were the ideological brainstem of the republican party to uh become super reactionary, to start realizing that oh, maybe we don't all have the same interests, maybe there are producers and laborers, or capitalists and laborers, and if so I know where my interests lie, it's not with the dirty laborers, I am, even if I am a mind worker, I know that my all allegiance is to capital because these people are more, these are my people, and my livelihood depends on the system that they have created, so you see a rise of trade organizations and associations, political groups, uh, fucking private armies and militias formed of middle class fancy boys in the cities to put down a lot of the rebellions that come up as a result of people uh fighting against their miseration and it led to a movement in the northern states to restrict democracy uh and also uh to yeah to limit budgets, limit taxes, uh, extend terms of office, change the jury system, and the north started imposing vagrancy laws, which if you guys remember is what the south did in the black codes after the war to try to keep a control of the black labor force, this is a way to keep control of the northern white labor force, is to say it's essentially illegal for you not to have a job, so congress tries to add some fucking green. to the system, throw some more cash into the economy, get some liquidity going, but fucking grant stung by all the criticism he had received from the liberal republicans bolted to support 72 vetos it reducing any chance of liquidity injection into the economy, and as a result of all this, the 1970, the 1874 mid-terms are a are a democratic landslide, it sees the democrats retake Congress for the first time since the civil war, uh, they win governorships throughout the north, they get, they become a democrat is the becomes governor of Massachusetts for the first time, there had never been one before that. uh and what this did was not lead to the south the democrats now becoming once again the national natural uh party of governance which had been before the civil war, it creates a 20 year period of stailment and what and what it was was 20 years of misery at the base of America, the lower you were to to precarity, the worst things were in this country uh, but that... but at the top of the elite uh parties that these base people voted on voted for, it was a bipartisan commitment uh to hard money deflationary um orthodoxy, which was the exact opposite of what the people who actually voted for these parties largely wanted, of course middle-class people, a lot of them, they were committed to hard money. for material interests, but a lot of these voters wanted something else, but because of the fact that the the suffering people of the country were divided by race and geography and the conditions of their labor and the uh their ethnicity and language, whereas the bourgeois or unified on all those fronts, it meant that the only parties to actually have influence at the top level of government want to maintain this structure, and so people voted instead because they were for closed, they were foreclosed from addressing their actual pain, they were forced instead to fight on cultural, geographic lines, things like uh, parochial education and Catholic Church, things like white supremacy in the south, things like the regional uh loyalties of the civil war, if this sounds familiar to anybody, this is exactly what we have now, where our working class, which had reached an articulation sufficient to influence government in the great depression has been deatomized into total total passivity and self-conception as consumers, so that is why is 100% correct in that the politics of our moment are not Germany in the 30s, they are the United States, because it's the United States in the 1880s and 90s. So the Republicans who had set up reconstruction the way they had on the idea of free labor ideology uh realized over the course of the depression and the right and as uh... working class militancy rose around them uh that you know what, free, free labor, that's not actually it, you know, there are contrasting in influences, I'm sorry, interests, there is actually a conflict of interests between labor and capital, which of course was the presiding view of the slaveocrats of the south, that's one thing they were demystified on, is that they had they built a racial category to allow them to hyper exploit their their laboring class, and in so doing... uh, they, but because it was a minority that they felt they could control, they felt that that was uh, sustainable, and northern industrial middle-class people thought, no, that's absurd, uh, labor and capital, if they are uh unequal footing, are uh, seeking the same thing, we're all trying to make each other better off, of course this is all intergurted by the ideas of sustenance autonomy in the in the in the in the land, which is gone now. um, so now the northern Republicans decide to give away with free labor ideology entirely and uh decide that, I guess I'm basically an industrial version of the uh planters, I guess George Fitz Hue was right, I guess we all, we are all all are either masters or slaves and we need to come into harmony with uh that understanding, we need to say, okay, I'm a master, therefore I will be a good master. or okay, I'm a slave, therefore I will be a good slave, and they started organizing their politics and their culture around trying to promote that idea. because they had been disillusioned by the reality of capitalism after the civil war. and this definitely meant that they decided to abandon the ex- slaves in the south. so while the democrats actually kind of lost a lot of their racial edge because they could argue now about the depression, they didn't have to just use white supremacy to try to uh get the uh rubes to vote for them. "they had this depression, which they could just blame on the other side, because they'd been in power when it started, so they they focused on race less, but republicans in the north became more racially conscious and more uh, more white supremist, because they were doing away with the free, free labor ideology which that was always a a fantasy and which is incompatible with the rising class conflict of the depression error." so in the south uh Grant, let's these southern democratic uh machines start taking power wherever they want, even by doing rigged elections and using force uh, their the government refuses to imburs depositors who lost their savings of the friedman's savings bank when it collapses. uh they just they harden their hearts to the whole thing uh and of course the depression is worse in the south than it is in the north because the economic level of activity is lower uh and there's a huge collapse of course in these the railroad uh industry they have there but then a huge drop in crop prices which is the basis for the entire goddamn economy uh and the white yowen start getting cast off of their land which will make them ready labor uh for the cotton textile mills that start going south in the 1880s uh and the rising black political class that had gained some level of influence in the south is destroyed by the depression uh uh the reconstruction governments that still exist are either uh basically powerless in the face of really concerted right resistance like Addelbert aimes in Mississippi. or in South Carolina, Daniel Chamberlin, uh, you uh, were decided to deal with the rising militancy of the Whites by just going along with whatever they wanted, and uh, and and Chamberlin, in South Carolina, starts, he reduces the size of the militia, which is largely black, he removes black judges, he tries to go bring back convict leas leasing and cut education, uh, and what of course were... black people get to do, vote democrat, they were held hostage as they have been ever since. the reality of black political organization in this country is that they because they are the uh the negative in the political imagination, like the cultural political imagination of one of the two parties at any given time, because white supremacy sort of has to has to be the organizing architecture of the most extreme version of American uh labor relations. because hierarchy has to be maintained somehow, as we saw with the civil war, if you if you change the the uh hierarchy, if you change social relations, you undermine the economic engine of capitalism, and this is what we're seeing here in these last chapters is capitalism reasserting itself by reasserting white supremacy, so that means that no matter how much the party, whatever it is at the time that represents black interests, however how much it betrays them, sells the... out for other interests, ignores them, they have nowhere else to go, because the other party is defined against their interests, and that's what's so funny about the democrat plantation ship from republicans, it's like, you're the reason that there is this, because you're only your existence is predicated on this, so as a result of this, the small burgening black middle class in the south just turns from politics completely, and you see the beginning of what turns into the uh Booker Washington model of self-improvement and political quietism that's going to be very influential as uh Jim Crow really solidifies at the turn of the center uh and meanwhile the white democrats have decided fuck the new departure fuck kissing ass or trying to get black votes they won't vote for us anyway let's just go all in on white supremacy and it worked in large part because by this point the republican party has nothing to offer the suffering poor white, neither party is offering any real uh amelioration of the conditions of the depression, meanwhile the democrats are offering lower taxes, which hey, who do don't want to pay less taxes and white white racial system where you're on top because the the the reality of depression, the reality of economic collapse is that everybody is panicked by definition, hyperaware of the precarity, and the democrats were able to pitch to the white people of the south, in this situation, it is a zero sum game, one group, the white or the black will... suffer and be dominated in these conditions, who will it beat? and because there is no real social connection between the two groups, because it had been forbidden by slavery, in the absence of any other incentives, it won out, and even the grange movement, which was not racially motivated in most of the country and and played a a role in like promoting cooperation. uh along axis of of you know actual economic oppression, elsewhere, in the south the grange was completely dominated by the planters, and agricultural interests, which elsewhere meant an ayoman farmer in uh the southern grange meant a planter, because their power was never broken up, so the the democratic pitch in the to the electorate after the after 74 is white supremacy, low taxes, control of black l uh and it led to a huge string of victories throughout the south uh edmund davis edmund davis we talked about who was a uh an effective reconstruction governor of Texas cracked down on the clan and and protected black rights successfully got crushed not because of the voters of the people who had put him in changing their minds but because of a huge influx of white immigrants from the rest of the south uh throughout the south. two-thirds of the house seats in the uh in congress went to the Democrats and of course the other thing that help this a huge wave of violence in the black belt, the murder of black and white republican office holders uh the attempt in Louisiana to install a governor through a military occupation that had to be put down by the federal government. That's how confident they felt at that point. And the... backdown on these literal insurrectionists horrified northern republican respectable opinion. it was seen as tyranical. oh my god, look at your tyranny that you're doing on our American citizens, just want to shoot people and prevent them from voting. and in the halls of power, everybody basically decided in the republican party that reconstruction have been a big bungle, waste of time. Grant actually said to his cabinet that he thought the... 15th amendment had been a mistake that had not benefited the blacks at all, that suffered that sufferage had been a mistake uh, and they also reason, well we're going to lose power in the south, but trying to hold power in the south alienates whites in the north, meanwhile, if we let the democrats retake the south and we are able to hold our position in the north because we're not now vulnerable to have uh the charge of being soft on blacks uh level that? we can get the north and if it's what and if it's a solid north versus a solid south we win because the north has more people and more votes and more uh more seats and more patronage and more money and everything they were willing to make that trade so well in the uh well in the last years of the grand administration the republicans could only manage to pass a water down civil rights bill that ended up getting uh declared unconstitutional in 1883 anyway, even though it had never really been able to have any effect because it always it all depended on being able to file federal charges, that was always the uh the emiliorative uh mechanism in these bills and why they were all dead letters before they were even fucking published because that ability is a function of ones access to civil society, which was denied to former slaves, but they were much more effective and much more efficient at at passing uh a bill that returned species payment in four years, meaning even though the depression was uh wiping over the country, wiping out value, leading people... with no ability to sustain themselves, uh, with little debate uh, and full unanimity almost, the republican party passes a bill to say, hey, we're going to be uh getting rid of all money that isn't backed by gold, which means retracting further the money supply, strangling the economy in the while it was choking to death. now the republicans obviously were horrified by the uh by the returns of the mid-term when the democrats swept, but uh, in the Ohio governor's race where a democrat was running on cheap money, was running on a greenback platform. uh the Republicans were able to cobble together a new strategy for winning in the north, even in depression behind their candidate Ruthford B Hays, Rutherford B governor after this uh, it was a saw, it was a very close race and Haise one by less than a percent, but he was able to win by holding on to the rural republican hinterland of Ohio, where everybody was a republican because that's the party, that's that was the party that hadn't been shooting at them during the war they fought in basically, like in the rural parts of these of the north and in the rural non uh mountainus parts of the south, your uh devotion to the party was simply the fact that you fought a war against those people, you're not voting for them, you don't need any other reason, it's pure identity politics around being a veteran or a family member of a veteran of the war, because the the the plane peasants of the south and north were the cannonfder of both armies, but uh, Haze was able to win, because in addition to those voters, he brought in that urban middle class who was horrified of the idea of the soft money populism uh, and also because the Haise had uh stirred up anti-catholic sentiment about parochial education and uh priests getting government funds, government subsidy to... to uh whip up the stauchly protestant middle class, of course hated the immigrant hords from Ireland in the city, and Germany too, mostly Germany really, the catholic ones, they were largely catholic, Cincinnati is part of that Catholic triangle of Milwakee, St. Louis, and uh, and Cincinnati, where the bavarians all moved after 48. so the recipe for northern sussax for the republicans is drop reconstruction entirely so that you don't bring up so that racism isn't an issue and you don't have to worry about people voting on race, whip up the uh urban protestants against the uh the catholic hords uh and rely on the bloody shirt and the sacrifices of uh gettiesberg to get the uh the veterans to vote for you and their families and that meant that they didn't need to worry about reconstruction anymore in fact depended. on sort of writing off the south. now in Mississippi, poor Adelbert Ames tries to run a fair election, the uh northern governor who wanted to see uh blacks get political rights, but was too detached, ineffective and uh unsupported by the federal government to allow to happen uh, he got he essentially had to stand back while an incredibly violent elections. saw mass violence against voters uh and the destruction of ballot boxes, stuffing, pure fraud, complete fraud, but there was no uh, there was nothing else to do, because for the north to aid Mississippi is to hurt them in Ohio, and if it's Ohio versus Mississippi, they know who to vote for, they know rather where the votes and the money uh and the and the logic of power lies, and so. Mississippi had to go, their fragilent election was recognized and reconstruction or reconstruction ended there, and at this point, there's no other possibility, the structures, the incentive structures are all in the direction of the sacrifice of the friedman, all the power pulled in that direction, so that's chapter 11. you guys are talking about, so the last chapter uh talks about the real turning point, the the historical sort of coda on reconstruction uh the 76 presidential campaign, so grant is by this point completely tired by scandal, whiskey ring and whatnot, uh, even though he could have run for a third term and kind of wanted to run for a third term uh he was at that point kind of tainted uh James G blain the man from Maine the powerful former speaker of the house also uh tarred with a railroad stock scandal, so the republicans nominate as the compromised candidate, the guy who save the ass in Ohio, Rutherford B Hays, he runs on good government blandishments, almost completely ignores reconstruction, and before the election they even in Congress repeal the southern Homestead Act so that no, not even any possibility exists for uh for x- slaves to get land and so that all that rich timber and mining area. to be exploited by corporate interests. the democrats nominate New York governor Samuel, who is essentially an avatar of wall street, he is the personification of finance capital who supported the south of the civil war and were uh the backbone of the democratic party's uh financial network, obviously the democracy was the party of like the simple mechanic of the cities, but uh, it was always controlled by capital, not never not, there was a third party candidate, there was like a Real Nater type guy, Peter Cooper, a philanthropist and industrialist in New York, founded the Cooper Union, and who uh was who ran on a greenback party campaign or ran with the greenback party, which wanted to inject liquidity into the economy and not see... the rise of a new slavocracy riding over all of humanity, not just southern blacks. uh, so there is a governor's race at the same time as the presidential race in South Carolina between the Daniel Chamberlin, the democrat or the republican governed to appease the the democratic establishment of the south against Wade Hampton, a former confederate general, even all of... cap chamberlin's blandishments and smoochery uh of the planter league didn't help him, they still ran hampton against them because these motherfuckers, there is no degree to which that they will ever accept your capitulation, they want you destroyed, they want their man to be in there, they'll happy to take your uh, your cowardice and and they were they're happy to to uh compromise you, but they have no loyalty to you and they will destroy you, and um, so what's interesting in South Carolina is that for reasons we talked about uh that are specific to the economy of rice plantations which dominated in that that part of the country or that part of the south as opposed to large cotton plantations that are closer that are in like the deep south uh black political power is in anywhere in the south was most articulated and most robust in South Carolina. Now part of that. is because South Carolina has one of the liest highest percentages of black population, but that's not the only reason, Mississippi also, I believe Mississippi at that point had a black majority in terms of of real population, but the majority of former slaves in Mississippi were former cotton plantation slaves and as we talked about, cotton planting is uh deskilled, it is unspecialized labor. uh, which uh means that there is less individual bargaining power within uh a by individual cotton laborers. uh, rice planting is much more specialized, which means that there is more skill involved, which means there's a greater degree of leverage that can be applied, there's a greater degree of autonomy of labor in conditions and in life for the people who work within it, which meant that when that or ended oh and also uh uh cotton labor is uh because it is unskilled but it's also uncapital intensive which meant that the ruling planter elite mainly kept their stuff they kept control of their land because they didn't owe that much basically but uh but like sugar planting rice planting is capital intensive or no I'm sorry uh it's not capital but it is specialized, which means that there was no incentive for capital to go in there, because they couldn't get enough, they couldn't get enough surplus, basically out of the labor that you could get in the cotton cell, so there is much more worker power, organized worker militancy and effective ability to negotiate in South Carolina, among South Carolina rice plantation workers. during this campaign rice workers walk off the job for higher wages and demanding cash instead of script, and the black power structure that did exist in many of these countries, black judges, black sheriffs refused to uh repress the strikers and in fact back them up and it led to the planters backing down, and this shows that there was the potential for per independently expressed black political power at the grassroots, but it was, it ended up being too isolated, but the places it was able to hold on were places where the conditions of labor before the war determined a a different uh power dynamic after the war. but even with this and even though South Carolina actually sees uh election violence perpetrated by blacks and not just uh against them uh the sheer uh overwhelming force of the violence unleashed by Wadehampton's red shirt militias is overpowering uh and even though Chamberlin gets more votes than any Republican in South Carolina history he still loses to Hampton in a election that is of course racked. fraud and fan balloting, but is ratified as part of the greater deal that we're going to get to, because the H tillden election ends with Tilden winning in the popular vote and winning many northern states, which had not gone democratic since the civil war, but having disputed results in South Carolina, Florida, and and Louisiana, which allow for the Republicans to claim they had one uh, and it leads to a big, a big conflict. uh on both sides threatening to march on Washington to impose their guy, but at the end of the day business didn't want that, because business controls both of these parties, so there's no real conflict, the conflict is all made up, the conflict is all a cultural uh uh pantamine for these silly uh sports fans, these blue and gray dipshits, who think this matters, at the top everyone knows what has to be done, and so Congress passes a law to allow... electoral commission, because when you have to reveal the lack of democracy in a system, you do it by appealing to the authority of something that is supposedly transcendent of politics like the gold standard or an electoral commission, which is made up of members of congress and Supreme Court justices and there's a bunch of jocking and and uh grift going on with getting the votes there. It ends with Haise being chosen by the commission and Haise mallifying the Democrats in Congress to attempt to obstruct his his uh inauguration by signaling with uh probably things that he didn't put down in writing but also through appointments to appointments to his cabinet that he was going to end reconstruction and with reconstruction off the table with troops promised in words or not to be removed. from the south, the uh, the democrats give up their obstruction and Haze is inaugurated. And so as reconstruction ends in the south, as redemption, as the the southern Democrats called that spreads across those those states and troops get pulled out so that there's no appeal to federal authority by any former slave if their rights are violated, they got to go to court, good luck with that. is in the north the great railroad strike of of 1877 which sees among the same republic sees a huge switch in opinion among republican middle class voters and intellectuals and politicians in their attitude towards the use of federal troops against American citizens. they've been horrified when Sheriden marched into into New Orleans and stopped the insurgents from taking power there uh they were a gassed that uh when the clan was broken up by the... army in uh North Carolina, they uh were absolutely cheering on the army to be used against the strikers, uh, not enough lead in the world to be poured into those demons. In fact a lot of these people start forming their own private armies, either funding or or creating middle class military organizations to to fight what they now recognize is a class war, and if there's a class war, they know what side they're on. so while this the uh the republicans had always bked at doing any kind of concentrated military occupation of the south they immediately started building armories in northern cities to ensure that if there's any labor unrest the military could put them down and this is this railroad strike is the real coming out party for American labor is a political a organized political movement and it would grow over time to challenge the liberal order. but sadly and tragically it would do that without the benefit of this huge group of American workers who could have been part of that uh that movement, the former slaves, the mobilization, the the recognition that comes with with the increased uh social intimacy uh came too late to change the power balance of power, but if freeman had been more supported in asserting their political power on the ground, in the grassroots, then there might have been more robust institutions of black political power to connect with the labor movement when it emerged, so well the uh, well labor is being suppressed brutally in the north, the south, southern governments that are now redeemed, put in institutions of government that essentially try to undo all the progress that had been done during reconstruction, the the school funding, the tax the infrastructure spending all reduced, taxes cut, spending to be reduced, reduction in the ability of states to borrow, cutting land taxes for the elite, but raising poll and license taxes, exempting people not for a x amount of property, but for in itemized personal property, and what's a coincidence, the itemized personal property that's tax exempt is the kind of property only used by planters, because unlike anything that andrew. Andrew Johnson dreamed of putting uh the uh planters back in power in the south guaranteed that the poor whites that Johnson claimed to support would also be ground under heel uh and black political power is broken by uh the institution of poll taxes uh widespread just poll fraud because democrats controlled the pole uh say states and the election boards and Jerry Mandring which we know and love to this day. now there were signs though that something else could have happened, that there are, there were meaningful political coalitions that could have emerged, because even this late in the game, even after reconstruction had disillusioned so many poor whites in the south away from uh supporting reconstruction, in the in Virginia in 1879 a uh a a fusion group called the readjusters were led by a former confederate general and railroad promoter William Holmes uh who promised to readjust the state's debt so that they could increase education funding which of course been kept low by the democratic governance uh and which was powered by a voting coalition of poor whites and former slaves one uh and while they were in power they funded school. later in the 1880s, populist republican fusionists one in North Carolina before being eventually uh repressed and and isolated by a unified coordinated democratic party, but the fact that this latest that you see viable political coalitions. that are able to persist in power, indicates to me that the possibility, that the richness of possibility is much greater than looking backward can sometimes make you feel like, so these reconstruction governments, these these redeemed governments also reinforced control over black labor by more than anything, widely increasing the penalties for petty theft and bringing in or either instituting or expanding the use of convict contract labor, if the private regime of power over black labor was abolished by slave by the 13th amendment, if the assertion of rights by by ex slaves and by the progress that reconstruction had been able to make in in racial relations made it impossible to do full state violence and full state coersion against all of black labor, the law could be used to find a subsection, a necessary subsection of black labor who could be compelled in slavery basically, and that's what convict leasing was. the exact, the exemption in the 13th amendment for involuntary labor labor, labor for involuntary, as a condition of servitude essentially allowed them to get what they needed, they didn't get they wanted buse there was successful attempts at asserting uh black rights throughout reconstruction that and was often aided by support in the north and vasillated, but and at crucial points came through, they couldn't do what they wanted, but the next fex thing was creating huge population of people who were not free because of their prisoner status, which was essentially arbitrary, because all of these notions of legal power, legal reality were fraudulent, which is where you get this huge alienation between the southern black community and notions of legal propriity. It's very funny how one of the persistent stereotypes of blacks is their criminality when that is in fact what every element of white society is organized to produce the they are criminal because they are a subject people and so of course they don't and and as a condition of that uh they're not going to accept. the validity of your institutions, why would they? they actually can see the fragilence of them. so uh, lean laws give landlords the claim over all the cotton cop that is produced, even over the demands of merchants, which means that uh all the risk of a of a crop whether or not it's gonna be harmed by uh, by... some sort of agricultural failure or whether the price is going to drop, all the risk of of growing crops is put on the shoulders of the of the workers and merchants, not on the landlords, what a shock, uh, and there's an interesting phenomenon where the, so one of the big conditions of this redemption and the and the depression is that uh, white small holders lose their land at a huge clip. and they become the base for a southern working class to labor in the uh cotton mills that start going up in the south in the 1880s because before the 1880s the economic model in the south was we we make the fucking cotton but fuck all that making it into anything stuff that that's too much that's too much capital I would like to keep all that capital please I would like to sit on that capital as the as the plantation owner. what what it's not my business if you have to bring together capital to do things like create a uh a system of factories and why would you want to bring together capital when you are sitting on top of uh a uh self-perpetuating machine of it so you had to go look north or and certainly across the Atlantic to England for that but the growth of finance capital in America the... that finance capital goes south, which means the the incentive to to invest grows, especially as labor militancy in the north grows, and these dispossessed white yowen become the new working class of these mills and there is an unspoken alliance between the uh plantation owners and the uh mill owners that blacks will work the land uh along with the whites who have... a sharecrop, but that um working in the mills is white work, which just very helpfully leads to a situation where uh, the races can be literally placed against each other in any labor conflict, and this is how the failure of reconstruction kind of makes America's politics more reactionary than it would have to be by taking out of political. this group of people whose sense of social solidarity is greater than anybody in the country, because they don't have anywhere to go, they don't have anybody to sell out, they don't have any, they don't have any luxury of believing the fantasys of American ideology, and of course I don't mean that universally, but I mean in aggregate, and by taking that out, by taking that group of people out of politics, you make it more reactionary, and you keep it dominated by a... dified uh working class and a ferociously capitalistic uh bourgeois, and that is where we are now, it's certainly does make Andrew Johnson the biggest idiot in the universe, because not only did he not get his narrow goal of becoming a two-term president with the aid of the democrats, but his beloved white uh white poor uh farmers of the south got completely fucking hosed and dicked over, but their decision to choose race over... uh over economics was made for them in many ways by the fact that the republican party as reconstruction were on ceased to offer an alternative. what else should you be voting for? there is nothing else to seek except for some lower taxes and a race wage. okay so that is uh... Eric Fanner's reconstruction, I i thought that was pretty fun, good book, uh, it's a classic for a reason, folks, uh, next week, I don't know what we'll talk about, but I don't think we're going to do any reading for it, but I'll be here on Wednesday and of course I'll be here on Friday too, um, but yeah, reconstruction, I hope going through that, you see all that there are, there are always chances, there's always openings, because what we got is the worst we could have gotten either, things could have gone even worse than they did, which means they could have gone better, butler man, they offered him the vp spot, god damn it, i'm not in Oregon, shut the fuck up, god and now you're gonna just not stop saying it because you love trolling, people love trolling. The modern Brookty Washington uh Mike Roe, yeah, I mean i'll say it now, I guess, I'm in California, I'll just say it, you guys have got an out of me, congratulations. Trust the plan indeed. That's one thing they get right is that great awakening is always going to be the only thing you can hope for, because nothing that you can sketch out in dry mechanical language can convince, so that's not what you carry with you, what you carry with you is a dream of awakening, and yeah, that is uh, that's cringe to talk about, that's because you're using something that is not transferable in words, you're using a feeling, and that is what is uh, That's what's propelling the vision forward, it's just those guys are all uh deluted weirdos because they're, but the thing is we're all deluted, we're all isolated, we're all trying to feel something, and I think we have more ability, thanks and part to technology, to bring our antennas together than ever before, and the kunon really is a proof of how that is possible, it's bad. example, it's not helpful, but it's possible uh, and if that is, anything is, trust the plan, bye-bye.
