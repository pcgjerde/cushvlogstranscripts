 office, we're doing a test stream here, don't freak out, it's not my backyard, i understand, i'll be back, i'll be back to my backyard, but right now we're testing out our capacity here at the at the at the shape offices for future use, and later to we might do some more uh some more stuff interactive, but right now we're just seeing how it works. I've got a pile of golf award trading cards here for us to enjoy and uh an amazing post from uh an amazing quote rather from Joe Biden today, they asked them about Q and on and his response was quote, I'm a supporter of mental health and I urged them to take advantage of the things in the affordable care act while it's still there, and of course that's being used as evidence that he is uh, that he is slaying and that he is dragging fools, but honestly i can't think of a more wildly, violently psychotic antisocial thing to say, the guy is really running on pure elder rage just as much as Trump is at this point, just... contempt for any anybody questioning him uh and his position, i mean take advantage of the american affordable care act to get mental health care, well it's still there, even though i'm planning on becoming president within the next six months, goddamn, he's a real sicco that guy. going to look through some of these golf war trading cards that we've got here, i haven't been able to look at them since the pandemic started, i'm going to look some of these fun things that happened during the last war we won, the war in Iraq, so they have these cards for different countries and ours is right here, the United States and it's Mount Rushmore, that emblematic part of America's geography, a charter member of the United Nations, the USA is a permanent member of the security council, the USA was designated to coordinate the liberation of Kuwait by the United Nations, that was nice of them, that was nice of them to let us do that, for operation Desert Storm, the USA supplied more than 500,0 troops, 2700 air units, 4200 armored vehicles and 100 warships, damn, that's something, that's impressive, but then we got the other country, the other main protagonist of the war, Iraq, founded by Calif Umar the first in 638, Bazra is the second largest city in Iraq, and Bazra is the home of Simbad in 1,1 nights. In 1914 a harbor was created at Basra during the Iraq Iraq Ocean access giving Iraq Ocean access. During the Iron Iraq war 1988 was the scene of fierce fighting during operation desert storm was repeatedly bombed to prevent assistance to the Iraqi forces in Kuwait. I love learning. I love learning things. including that one of the military skills you can learn in the military is survival, which honestly seems like it be number one, number one skill to learn in the military is survival. many situations in combat may leave soldiers, seamen or pilots cut off for the main group with no supplies. survival training and equipment will help them keep going until telp arrives or they can return to friendly territory on their own. the most important aspect in survival according to instructions and a US military survival is quote, keep your head, native tribes live for generations in the open air, taking their living from nature, you can do the same, best of luck, and remember that courage alone has won many a battle, that's nice, your ass is on your own, i like that one of these cards is middle eastern greeting customs. and the Canadian system of government, which I can't think of a more meaningful context for this than the Iraq war. "the Canadian government is divided into three autonomous but linked branches: Parliament, the legislative branch is bycameral, that is divided into two parts, the senate and the House of Commons, the executive branch is headed by the prime minister who is advised by a cabinet, the judicial branch interprets the laws and oversees the entire court system. the ceremonial head of government is the English monarch, currently Elizabeth II. It's still her, how the hell is that lady still alive? how much adrenachrome can one person eat? that lady needs to share. something with the rest of us, i mean maybe i would like to see the clockwork uh elves in like the mirror blood dimension where the hell creatures live do we got anything what are they talking about hi i'm here uh i'm also here let me turn on my camera let's see uh we've we've got a a lot of people who are confused uh irritated uh disoriented by the different setup I figured, um, but you know, I think that they are working through that together, um, I'm looking at the chat right now, so if anybody has any questions, comments, uh, things that they would like to, it's okay, I understand, you can see my legs and I know that that's upsetting, I, I'm not happy about it either, we'll fix the blocking in future episodes, do you want me to, do you want me to uh uh post up the camera? No, it's fine, they'll have to get used to it, um, so yeah, uh, tell, tell me what your, what, what do we want Matt to talk about today? Yeah, uh, I would, I would love to do a chapo ASMR episode, my idea for an asmr episode is simply reading the wikipedia page for the 30 years war, uh, come on, let's get some some, okay, I, I mean, I don't want to belaber this, but uh, I, I was almost going to ask you about this earlier, Matt, did you see that uh, Matty G, uh, had some responses to our chapa reading series today, I only saw the one, did he have more than one? I think, the only one I saw was the thing about... relitigating five-year-old twitter beevs, but which is hilarious coming from him, which is absolutely fucking hilarious coming from him because his entire fucking his entire mindscape is just doing battle with other fucking people on twitter, i have good, i have on good authority that the motherfucker has gone to anger management over tweets, so once again as with all internet contact, all internet conversation, it's just projection. everyone's projecting, he he's he's living in his own little uh hall of resentment mirrors. um, in lu of anything more substantial right off the bat uh, somebody asked for some Lodge 49 talk i just started watching Lodge 49, I'm about halfway through the first season, and it's as good as you thought it was, I thought it was going to be much darker, I didn't know it was going to be such a uh, I wouldn't call good vibes, but it is kind of a blue sky show with darker under underpinnings, it's a it's a chill vibe, I think. that its general attitude is one it's positive because it's it's open-hearted and it's it's confident that there is like there is something redeemable in human life and in human uh in human social interaction that we're not all just uh doomed to bounce off of one another in cosmic nightmare horror until eternity which is the main theme of most prestige tv shows uh the thing that struck out of me like it's kind of superficial but I thought it was very well done is the very compassionate depiction of how you know you can be living a nice normal life and like two bad twists of faith like a snake bite and your dad having an untimely death like totally spiral you into oblivion yeah uh I thought that that was that was nice yeah no it it the show is very grounded and it it's it talks it's very specific in the way that it addresses how uh, we are absolutely at the whim of the market and how that has left us with this terror in our hearts, because we can't have any faith that anything we have today is going to even be there tomorrow uh, but it it's not totally niolistic or dark because it recognizes the potential for people to cross those casms of fear and uh come together uh in a secret lot. dedicated to uh turning led into gold uh as as we should all be dedicated to, I think that we could do uh, would you, Matt, would you consider uh the the long-term endeavor of transforming lead into uh gold a a suitable grill pill uh pursuit? you know what, yeah, go for it. I just want to say one thing about the about the uh, about the fucking egglas deal cuz eglacius is responding to somebody else who listened to the episode. and then just says, these guys are being reactionaly, they're being pro, sprawl, antinatalist, and no, we just said that you glacius is stupid, like alart technocratic. approach is bullshit and unworkable and that any of the problems that he talks about have to be addressed by people uh like overthrowing the domination of their lives and and finding some actual uh autonomy from the market, not to just submit to it fully in the name of beating the chinese, but with these people, like they are the blackest pilled of all, because they they don't think that there is any alternative truly to the... to a world of of of market enslavement that that we can never transcend separateness to the extent that we can have a collaborative political project, we will only be mass, we will only be able to mediate our desires in the market, and the best we can hope for is to fool enough roobes with with some uh clever nationalist jujitsu to get him to go along with positive policies and they're so fixed on that that if you say that they're that their technocratic fixes are insuffficient or that they create problems that their the political structure they assume to be uh immutable can't absorb that you are actually on the other side and you actually think no one should have kids and no we should sprawl out into oblivion no no there is no reason if anyone listen to that episode to think that. you could only think that if you are so wetted to this format, this format of human uh political engagement that any alternative to it is just a non-starter and that if you aren't on board with their blueprint, you are uh kicking out the idea of making anything better for anybody, even though their model for change is impossible, i mean has he fucking noticed that nothing got better? has he fucking noticed that Obama had eight years to basically do exactly what these guys want to try to to try to nudge us, remember cast sunsteen in the nudge, that was how we were going to get to equitable society, just subtle little nudges, we're going to push us into being decent human beings to one another, how did that fucking work? they had eight years to fucking do it and they didn't get close and everything that they could even point to in this near, i mean my god biden said uh, take advantage of the Aca while it's still there, like just assuming that this thing that was supposed to be a big fucking deal in Biden's own words, is just a fucking sand castle that are blown over by a stiff fucking breeze, does uh you guys are the real nialist man and you guys are the ones who have decided that uh just as long as you have a smug answer for something you're do you're contributing you're you're contributing to the world um how about this? met uh to switch gears into historical counterfactuals because we were just talking about them uh based on the Atlantic article, would it have been better if the Germans had won World War One? Well, I mean, the first thing you got to ask is could they have, because if they couldn't have, it's sort of an inoperative point, because the world would have to be so different for them to have won that it's like, well, now we're not even talking about a world we recognize, um, and I don't know if the Germans could have won World War One, uh, 'if we'd stayed out of it, maybe, but like there's i there are people who made a strong point that the Germans were actually broken before we even showed up and that their position in the middle was untenable, especially given their allies, uh, I guess the only way they could have won a war is is a shorter war, but where they were able to like get a definitive outcome before it turned into a war of attrition, because Germany'. they love starting fights, but they can't finish them because they they don't have the the the the material base to fight everyone, which is what they seem to want to do all the time or did anyway, although now they just they just took over everybody from with the central bank, which was very clever of them, so i don't know, i mean if they won the war, i don't know how that could have been possible, but you probably still have a great depression and you still have. like the crisis of fascism, I mean in Harry Turtledov's books, Germany wins World War One in Europe, but then England and uh France become fascists, and you could argue that France was really the most fertile soil for fascism in Europe, certainly the most like politically where political anti-semitism was the most advanced uh, and that a defeated France could have been absolutely ground zero for fascism, but who knows? Uh, I just want to shout out the person in the chat, I think correctly states that uh, German victory could only have been achieved if pointy or helmet technology had been uh available at the time. Yeah, those pickle houbes needed to be much sharper. for for them to have any hance chance um let's see more the real the real couterfactual with Germany is what if the German revolution of 1918 it succeeded uh that's a real one yeah that I mean that was my take when we were just talking a moment ago about uh the the losers in the world war one cemetery they they were only losers and suckers because they didn't join with the uh internationalist movement right after the war yeah All right, I, I do like that, but I am a fan, I am loving the Trump thing uh, because the Trump thing with the troops, I mean obviously for one thing, this is all excalpatory from guys like Jon Kelly who just want to be, they they hate Trump, but they still served him and they need to have that litigated in public so that they can have their sense of guilt assaged, in which case boo fucking who, it was your own fault, uh, and I got to say there's I can't think of greater. and Trump being like, what were they doing, what a bunch of losers, why would you fight, why would you get killed? and that shows a fundamental friction point between different elements of like the ruling class, because the military does require an ethic, some sort of ethic of sacrifice right, some sort of ethic of a higher good, or else you wouldn't join the military, but all that higher good is in practice just doing the... will of people like Donald Trump, but the social contract is predicated on people like Donald Trump not saying that out loud, they say thank you for your service, they they they give you the the the bathetic tributes to make up for the fact that your death was in vain uh, and he just doesn't have the wear with all or like emotional and intellectual continence to not just say, you're a fucking sucker for fighting and dying for guys like me, uh, and John Kelly just has to take it. he just has to stand there and take it and then he leaks to the Atlantic so that they can publish it a year later and he thinks he's doing something uh but it does make you wonder about like the the i've talked before about how the military is going to really be the deciding peace in any kind of crisis prolonged political crisis in this country and they're like they are the least they're sort of the most ideologically... obscured element of the ruling class, you know, by date, by definition, by nature, and it's and and and as a result it's harder to predict where they would go and how they would respond, and that's why the military often in periods of crisis in in different countries and different periods of time, ends up just subsuming all politics within itself, uh, but not on one, not on like the cultural terms of one side or the other, trying to transcend them, which of course is silly. eventually doomed, but they don't know that because they actually believe this shit, if they didn't, they wouldn't be in the army, they'd be making real money doing something else. um, did you see that uh, that thing that was going around last week, that poll that had uh, the majority of the of military supporting Biden, yeah, and apparently officers more than the listed men, which some people were baffled by, but for me that's pretty simple, most officers in the mil. went to college, yeah, isn't that just college versus non-college? it's college versus non-college, that's the real battle, like the like it's a civil war here between white people based on who went to college and and and how that structures their alienation, how that structures their like resentment and their anger and their frustration at being part of a system that is like dehumanizing them on a daily basis, which we all feel to some extent or another, if we don't feel it personally we see it done to others around us and we fe happening to ourselves, and how we how we deal with that, how we find the source for it is largely dependent on the cultural, the cultural baggage that we've accumulated either from our communities, which tends to make people sort of uh like culturally reactionary, or from the suite of opinions you get from the college uh uh process, the the the process of being a culturated into bourgeois norms. Uh, Mr. Kringe 69420, I can tell you right now, the audio kush vlog feed exists as of this moment, it is up, I have uh, I have levelated every cush vlog uh, or mastered every clush vlog into mp3 form, um, and I'm in the process of publishing them, only, I've only had time to put 10 up on the feed so far, I, I still need to submit it to the Itunes uh music store. uh to get it populated in all the the catchers uh, but hopefully over the next few days i will upload every, i think there are 71 or 72, this will be the 72nd uh cush vlog so hope. hopefully by um by monday or so we'll have all those up and going and you'll be able to listen to these not only as live video broadcasts but also uh as as uh podcast in the next in the day or two afterwards after whenever i get them going so that is it's it's the progress moves forward um uh a guy in the chat matt asks for a shout out because they finished capital volume one last night they request an adaaboy atta boy what's the handle flank ocean flank ocean flank like you know like Frank but in baby talk flank flank ocean well congrats on finishing uh capital it's bear by the way one of these cards says intelligence file judaism Jews believed God is Jews believed God is above all and created everything accepting the 10 commandments and sound sine formed a covenant or pack with God by observing God's laws they gain their protection synagogues are the place and the Saturday the day of rest and worship the three main branches are orthodox, conservative and reform, so there we go, now you have read the intelligence file on judaism, i would like to, i would i wonder what in like the CIA archives if there is just a file labeled judaism and what is contained within it? i would like to know as well. um, all right, here's maybe a curve ball, i don't know if this is a good question or bad question, is there an argument to be made that trump is actually the harm reduction choice uh given the the possibility of stacatic like Quan based violence uh i i've thought about this and and I think that there's the thing is is that there's a the reason harm reduction is a silly cat way to go about all this stuff is that you don't know like you just said they said stochastic we don't know uh I think the queue and on violence is inevitable I think q and on violence is going to happen whether Trump wins or loses. uh, but i i do think at this point it'll still be relatively disorganized, it'll be you know the the least, the most disturbed and the least coherent and the most sort of like violently attached members of the of the movement expressing themselves personally through violence, and i think that's inevitable and that's going to get bigger, but i don't think it's going to become like a a a public health crisis, you know, par with uh coronavirus or something like i was say i i i i honestly don't know how you can look at this situation and look at this political consensus and say that you're going to be able to pick who's going to make things less terrible uh and the good news is you don't really have to spend that much time on it because as i keep saying voting your individual choice to vote for anyone is not really meaningful so don't sweat it too hard. do what you want, if it feels like you, if you feel like you should vote for Biden, don't feel like you have to like spend 40 days on top of a mountain to purge yourself of that feeling, or if you feel like you don't want to vote at all or you want to vote for the party or you want to vote Trump is an ironic bit, don't spend too much time on like the the the moral question of it, because all you end up doing is is is building up the act of voting into this mythic self-defining act. which is what they want you to think, like the reason that we're able that that we're one of the big reasons we are where we are is because people have seated to voting a huge chunk of their sense of autonomy in life and their control over their future, like the fact that we vote is supposed to be this thing that defines us as people and defines our destiny, but it's really just what a hundred million people just shuffling into a fucking uh place independently and just pressing a button there's no coordination, there's no pressure, there's no meaningful uh uh organizing within like the voting public at large, it's an individual choice, and and it's you should probably only think about it as long as it takes to wait in line and then press the button, and then that hole that used to be filled with asking these questions of yourself can be filled by asking questions that are more relevant to your life. um, okay, uh, going off of the uh, the queuenon thing, a few people are asking uh, and this kind of, i guess this would frame in in something you were talking about, maybe last week, maybe the week before, the the kind of everything is an op framework, yes, uh, do you have any thoughts about the Portland shooter being killed yesterday? I'm seeing a lot of stuff that he was released from custody after. like driving 110 miles on the highway with a kid in the car and and guns and stuff and and that he had like a totally apological instagram until like a couple months ago and a fresh BLM tech. to and it's all very eyebrow raising certainly, but uh, but I guess I ask question I have is for people who are like freaking out about this is, okay, now what, like, what, what is, how does this, how does, if he's an op, if he's a cop, what does it mean, you know, if the cops are out there doing agent provocatur shit, like, and if they think shooting a uh, a patriot prayer guy is a good use of their time, well then what does that tell you? about like the efficacy of this movement in general like it if you're if you think that the if the that the cops have an interest in seeing tensions raised and stakes raised along violence, i mean then doesn't that mean that you you should it's your responsibility to the degree that you can to not take them up on it doesn't that make sense or is it always the cops are going to do what they do and then we just use it as used to do whatever we wanted to do anyway, and we never stopped for a second to question, okay, like how does any of this fit into a broader like dynamic? but i don't know, i have no idea if he was like an op or anything, everything seems, i mean i i'm a certainly believe that in all these specific locations the cops are doing all kinds of shit that we have no idea about uh, but my... If I had to guess I'd say it's probably local initiative. I mean, maybe it's like part of some some CIA uh, a Gladio C operation, but uh, I mean, if that's real, if that if you really think that then I think it would the the next step would be reasso re uh evaluating like your entire orientation towards the current moment, instead of just doubling down on everything. but I don't know, uh, more questions, yeah, uh, all right, I saw somebody asking this a little earlier, and I almost want to bring it up just because it was something I was thinking about or getting irritated about the other day, um, which is uh, I was listening to uh, I was on a run listening to pod safe America as a... do uh still still i mean it look it makes me run faster cuz when i get done with the run i can stop listening to it uh but they were doing their their now normal thing of um you know uh uh now the work is to get the only goal the only thing is to get Trump out of office and then we can start the hard really hard necessary work to fixing all of the structural things that got trump into office in the first place and somebody in the chat was asking what happens to the democrats after Trump because they're seeingly their only organizing principle right now is not Trump and this is the thing that I was like hitting myself in the head with a hammer listening to these guys to talk about because there is no principle beyond this like what is the work of the democrats after Trump uh I don't know I would just want to what what what do you say restoring dignity to the office getting the cheeto dust. out of the drapes in the oval office, just just vacuuming for four years, getting all the damn cheeto dust out of the place. I would say that that if there is an argument for Biden, it's that Biden and his party presiding over the current crisis, uh, the insufficiency of that response is going to be pretty clear and pretty dramatic, and there will be none of the Obama patina that protected him from a serious like left response during his presidency, people people are beyond that, but the problem is, the question is whether or not like that alienation from the democrats will be organized and turned in anything coherent or if it will just result in a further disaffection from politics in general, in which case the electorate shrinks even further and to the advantage of the Q lunatics who will become the... only active base of engaged political citizens in this country, because no one else will have any reason to believe that their vote will ever matter in any meaningful way? yeah, or the things that like you know to the extent that the uh democratic vote is is mobilized right now, it is in this um, you know, i don't think for most normal people, it's you, i want to say hysterical just in the tone of it, but i don't think that the actual. response to a Trump presidency is is totally hysterical, but socially certainly totally, but you know, I guess the worry is that it becomes the uh, people do just get to go back to brunch right, and then without an organizing principle after that... what happens to that version of the electorate? we've proven that nothing, at least the democrats have proven that that they are committed to not investing in changing anything, so what is the organizing principle to motivate an electorate after that? and it appears to be nothing, so I mean this you know just recapping what you're saying about the only people motivated are the people who are convinced that they need to out the satanic sub-government from from the actual government, yes, and I mean if there's any hope it's that... there's not going to be as many places to go to brunch anyway, brunch will be cancelled, i keep on rolling back and forth in my head that this election is the beautiful boaters versus the beautiful brunchers, oh it's true though, it's very true, um, let's see, what else, somebody was posting about zachary taylor in here, but i think it got removed by the automon, somebody's trying to suppress zachary taylor truth, yes, there is a conspiracy theory. about Zackry Taylor, uh, it's that he was poisoned by pro-confederate forces because of his resistance to uh, the the the southern demands for the territory seas from Mexico being open to slavery, uh, which was headed towards a a irresolvable crisis when he just dropped dead, and so there was a theory for many years that it was, there was some uh slave power conspiracy. to poison him and he was actually exsumed a few years ago, yes i remember this, they clipped his hair because they thought it might have been arsenic because and arsenic will will linger in the hair samples for hundreds of years after death uh, but they didn't find any, apparently he just drank the doodo water, he drank the doodo water, although the time they said it was cuuse he took, he went up for a ride in the sun and he was all sweaty and then he just housed a bunch of cherries and milk and it killed cherries and milk. which is the way people used to die because no one knew what was happening so they would just say the last thing he ate, like there was a an English king I forget who's like stomach was supposedly exploded because he ate too many eels, too many, yeah, I know the eels guy, yeah, yeah, so so it was just like, I don't, man, he just ate all those fucking cherries and he just killed over, uh, but it was probably the culprit was probably the same culprit for the death of Harrison and probably Pulk too, the giant stagnant pond of human shit, was a few hundred yards behind the white house during that entire period uh let's see what else uh somebody's asking me who your favorite fictional president is, i feel like you've talked about fictional presidents a lot on on this stream specifically have i? you i think you did a whole segment about fictional presidents once? who's the best fictional president? uh, i like uh Jack Nicholson in uh mars attacks. because he's completely ineffectual, has no idea what's going on and just gets fucking owned after giving a fancy speech that's supposed to solve everything uh, he has the right level of smarminess for a true president, earth and mars, um, all right, in lu of anything better, uh, somebody keeps asking if you could choose a historical war and make go the other way, which would you do? oh boy, uh, fuck, while you're thinking, I will say, no, I do not have five gamer chairs in my room, we you are looking at two different angles of the same uh, fabled chapo office, yeah, that's not Chris's place, he does not have five gamer chairs, and these aren't even gamer chairs, they're just office chairs, yeah, you people are weirdos, doesn't it have to have the name of like a fucking. of of energy drink on it to be a to be a gamer chair uh speaking of gaming if anybody in the chat uh has ever encountered a problem with the uh geforce RTX ti graphics card uh not accepting drivers on windows and um not uh recognizing dual monitor setups the geforce RTXti uh slide into dms because i could use some tech help because this office computer is not responding to me um anyway uh give us an office tour here uh check this shit out it goes yeah let's check out the office here there there and that's fucking it that's it it's just one big room it's full of old t-shirts and shit yeah we got a lot of t-shirts here anyway uh uh uh uh uh fictional war oh no uh real war right real war real war you want to go fictionally yeah uh I mean the tanky answer is obviously the uh the Soviet Polish war uh and that's that's interesting but honestly I think at that point it probably wouldn't have mattered I don't think that they were going to roll over anybody because at that point Germany was was solidifying behind reaction uh I don't know it's always hard to find like a war that uh that is like contingent enough that the the... that the that the outcome could have been different and there but also significant enough that that would have had like long rasting repercussions, maybe the taiping rebellion, the the the there's no question that the uh that the king the the king, the manshues had fucking absolutely lost the mandate of heaven and them holding on for another 50 years was was pretty perverse. i blame uh, i blame the British as always. basically any modern war the the British one other than that awesome for them to lose anything uh anything else good in the uh in the the cards looking at some good cards uh the tyconic roga class cruiser that's a good one the Persian golf we love it very important where we all of our oil comes from and their big dog here, the M1 a1 abram's tank, that's our guy right there, powered by a revolutionary gas turbine engine, the M1A1 is a heavy main battle tank with the speed and agility of a light armor vehicle, we got to pick up a few of these chris, these sound great uh they can't be uh they can't be too much on the uh on the rese market at this point right? now there's got to be a ton of them. with 1500 horsepower the Abrahams can traverse flat terrain at 45 miles an hour. rugged terrain poses no problem for its unique hydro-pneumatic suspension system. the Abrahams was the stalwart of the operation desert storm ground attack. it fired so many depleted uranium rounds. uh. Matt, did you happen to read uh president G's recent article on Marx's political economy in contemporary china? no, but that sounds interesting. I would like i i am kind of interested, I would like to know more about like how the hell the Chinese like party members square all this shit, like they have to know that they're not doing communism right now, but do they think, do they have a plan for doing communism or are they? just kind of kicking the can down the road like our guys are where you have like a vague understanding that you have principles that you would hear to, but for the most part they are sacrificed eternally on the altar of expedience or are they like really pushing towards something? i have no idea and i don't know enough one way or the other. it's i'm certainly a little skeptical frankly of uh of the of the project, but that's because i have no idea, but yeah i'd like to read that. uh, i have a... "know nothing about uh contemporary china, but I'm always curious as to the audience is for an article like that, or like you know actual, I think it's it's members, I mean, remember there's millions of people in the Chinese communist party, you know, and they have varying levels of commitment to the ideology of it, and uh, and that's his whole like, his whole marxist revival is clearly aimed at that grass roots, I just don't know how like effective it is or or how meaning." it even is if even if anybody at any level of power anymore is operating off of anything other than the most emergency sense of like uh of of of managing crisis in the moment with no long-term goals beyond survival certainly feels that way everywhere um someone keeps asking uh if we'll do an episode on this, i don't know if we'd ever do an episode on this, but uh do you have any takes on the zodiac killer? not talking uh, i do think it's funny that two separate guys have written books saying their dad was a zodiac killer, i think that's pretty funny, a lot of people working out uh family issues through the lens of unsolved murder cases. uh, i don't know, i have no idea, i i i i don't even have a theory is to who did it, i don't really think that the zodiac movie theory, the grassmith theory is really true, but i don't have any alternative one that i think is more plausible. It's honestly not even that interesting a case when you strip it of the of the media angle, which of course explains why it's so enduringly popular, anybody who writes to the media, especially in the in the and that... era when newspapers were the defining like architecture of like civic engagement uh those guys are always going to live forever like brirquet same thing remembers Gary Ridgeway because he didn't write any letters to the fucking editor uh let's see all right you've been talking about this a little bit, i i don't even know really what this question means, but it'd be a good time to just make some compar generalized comparisons. uh, you've been reading the uh, the Reagan Land book, yeah, i just finished it, you're you know about the invisible bridge, yeah, do you think our current time resembles the 1970s? there's a case to be made that we're in a similar crisis, but the thing about the 70s was is that is that the new deal consensus, the new deal great society. sensus was was buckling, but there was emerging an alternative, and and it was coming, it was being created along ideological axis and political axis by figures like Milton Frieedman, and Ronald Reagan and the Mount Perrylin society, you know, there was there was this free market uh - supply side political ideology uh was waiting in the wings and that was being formed out of the crisis of the collapse of the neal consensus to replace it. i think we're in a similar crisis point for that regite consensus that we've been living with for 40 years, but there is no emergent alternative, that that's what distinguishes this time from that, and that's what's so terrifying about the moment, because like the Reagan revolution was: the sort of the final, the final domination of politics by markets, like the final the final seeding of any even illusion of political autonomy on the part of the the political class to finance uh and but once that final transfer has been made, there's no one else to hand it off to, there's no one else to take power because you have obliterated the... political sphere, you've turned it into a pure spectacle, you've turn it into a pure zone of of disengaged resentment, which means that when the wheel start falling off, there is no formation to resist it, and of and of course the reason, the reason that we ended up with the Reagan uh, realignment is because there was this capital intensive effort to create an alternative, but now there is there's nothing else, there's no viable alternative to just stripping the fucking uh wiring out to taking out all the copper pipes. yeah, and this kind of goes back to that thing that I was asking about, like what is the project of the Democrats post Trump, it's I think it's telling about that lack of alternatives that the last two major political movements have been very held up in and creating popular opposition to the person of somebody, yeah, the t- party and the popular right-wing revulsion that at least in its broadest considerations were a revulsion at the person of Barack Obama or Sacombo, yeah, and then the the that resulting in plus other factors resulting in Trump, and then at this point, two months out from the uh, the 2020 election that... the popular formulation of the democrats is mostly a revulsion to the person of Donald Trump, yes, yeah, that that there there is no force to be considered, at least in the broad minds of the populaus, it's just these these guys that we got to get out of there, we got to get this guy out of here, we got to get them out of here, and then they'll be okay, and then it'll be okay, uh, I think what the republicans found out is that is that once your guy is out of there, things don't get any better, but man, it's fun watching the libs get pissed. and that then becomes its own, it's own mana, it's own Ambrosia, its own opiot uh, and I don't think the libs got anywhere near that kind of satisfaction from watching the conservatives freak out about Obama, especially after the mid-terms in 2010, and it's hard to imagine them getting any real satisfaction out of watching Biden be president, especially since it's really some people have said that like Biden might actually... be able to deliver on his promise of deescalating the cultural conflict, just because he himself is such a bland empty vessel that he he doesn't contain any of like the red flags that enrage, I mean there's a reason that Trump constantly says that Biden's not actually in charge of the Democratic Party, that it's the squad and that it's an antifah, because the person of Biden can't sustain that anxiety and that terror the way that the person of Brock Hussain Obama could, and I don't know if that's true, I suspect it isn't, certainly if you know they carry out the the the austerity, uh depression response that they're likely to. pursue, but at the same time, Obama, just Biden does seem to be such a symbolically empty figure on both sides, that it makes me feel that we're we're probably not going to see some sort of ratcheting down just because conditions are going to keep getting worse, but the the thing people fight about is probably not going to be the person of the president, it could be, but it just seems hard to sustain, unless Kamala Harris becomes president, then all bets are off. uh let's see what else here's something i'm kind of interested in this is a real grab bag cuuse i'm just like going going with whatever peaks my interest let's be bop and scap do you think there's anything to the seeming popularity of the true crime in podcasts and media why over the last like really in the trump first trump administration there's been this explosion of true crime. media, i mean obviously there there's some kind of pathology that we're working out there that we're we're excising. yeah, absolutely. i think it's it's we want to feel, we want to feel the danger that we know is there, but we can't see. we need to, we want to psychially enact violence and trauma that is absolutely sufusing. our lives, but is for most of us, the ones of us who listen to podcasts, largely out of view, and there's something agonizing about that, there's something agonizing psychially about living in a milieu that feels savage, that feels like it's fraying, like a social fabric that is dissolving, but crime isn't really up, you know, like people aren't experiencing more violent crime, we've had a spike in the last few months, which I said was going to happen when people started dropping like flies and the economy collapsed, it's it's absolutely predictable, but this obviously predates that significantly and predates covid, uh, we want some sort of way to psychially imagine and enact this sense of danger that is permeating everything but is unspoken otherwise, that's my suspicion anyway, yeah, and then I think it's it's putting on my uh podcast producer hat, it's that... and then it's just like an endlessly rich source of text, you can just like pull up a wikipedia article and have a podcast episode ready to go, well that's the other big thing is that it is, it is public domain information, yes that can be easily and cheaply mold over for an audience, which considering the uh the nature of podcasting and it's specific like low overhead for you, uh production costs and content uh it's it's it's sort of like an improf thing like okay give me give me a give me a give me a a fast food restaurant uh and a murder weapon and then we'll just do an episode okay somebody got beaten to death with a milkshake machine at a dairy queen go and then you can talk about that for an hour um i don't want to blow up their spot too much but uh chapo recently got dethroned by another podcast. uh called true crime obsessed, there's two people used to do a broadway theater news podcast, fact one of the hosts, i believe was the host of the official disney on broadway podcast, doing a true crime podcast that is very uh yasseny about murder victims, i think they only review like 48 hours documentaries about murders and stuff, wait a minute, they just watch a tv show and so they're not even doing the research of reading the wikipedia article, yes, wow uh, so you can imagine how enervated i got when i discovered that this thing exists uh and i encourage you all to look it up and just google true crime obsessed and and and check out their web presence and see uh just imagine how uh irritated i became when i discovered to this show you what though at the same time like politics is another thing like that it's another thing you can refond it's it's it's public domain. which is really what people are looking for when they're looking for things to to to provide shape for. podcast uh attempt, yeah, and and honestly no shade on anybody, I don't even care that that they're number one on patreon, everybody should get it, we're doing fine on Patreon, it's it's independent podcasting is is, I i truly believe in it as the value of independent media, but yes, as the person pointed out, they are literally soy facing in their landing page photo to their true crime, true crime, uh uh, Gary Ridgeway, ah, um, Gary Ridgeway, you're so smart. uh, ah, you're small, oh my god, you're a your your truck, your truck b is so nice, let's see, uh, what else, what else is going on, uh, on here, politics is true crime, you know what, that's true, it's true, they are, it's the same thing, yeah, it's the same thing, it's like it's just it's about the level of abstraction, like for some people, it's too abstract to talk about politics when you could be talking. about a person getting shopped up by ginsu knives and put into a series of uh of mail boxes, like that is more, that's more, they connect more to that, they can visualize it much more easily than they can visualize political process, but it's also it's it's either way, you're you're you're you're graphically describing trauma and horror, it's it's almost only about the uh the scale of time that things are enacted, you know, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah. and the intensity of like the personal experience uh let's see let's see what else uh we add the peat bodha judge podcast my rotation i don't think so though i have considered doing a um the new york review of uh podcasts i kind of want to just listen to the top five non- daily politics podcasts which right now include um on a given week like the the the peat podcast is one uh ben shapiro is always they're the dann kranshaw and dan bungino bongo guino oh god really uh podcasts are always in the top five news and news and has a podcast yeah i kind of want to just listen to all five has no takes it's like he's so fucking boring uh he's just yeah i kind of want to just listen to all like one week of all five of the top five news in politics episodes and then do an episode like a solo episode reviewing them i would be interested in that i would' and I would want you to do it cuz I don't want to listen to that shit uh maybe maybe some week where I have a kind of down week of producing I'll I'll do that and and let all of you know what Dan Bogono Bonobo uh Dan bonabo uh does on his uh on his on his podcast they have a card here for every country that provided any assets to the war in Iraq the Persian the the gulf. so there's one here for Sierra Leone who sent 200 troops, there's one here for Finland who provided economic assistance and support of the international red cross military hospital, wow, thanks guys, yeah, totally cool, um, all right, we're coming up on an hour here, uh, let's try to get maybe one more question of of of substance and then and then a silly one, yes, that sounds good, uh, so uh, other than just misspellings of dan baginos, dan bungingo, um, oh my god, so this is Niger right, listen to this, a former French colony Niger gained its independence in 1958, its geography is strongly influenced by the sahara, araboland constituting 3%, supports peanuts, cotton and millet, uranium is a principal export, yeah, remember the yellow cake that they didn't get from, oh yeah, the yellow cake, uh, trading partners include France, Nigeria and Japan, in recent years drout and famin have plagued the country, is a member of the United Nations and the coalition forces, can't even list the contribution, like their name is on like a document saying go for it, yes sure, uh, the it is not a nato deck of cards, it is golf 1 playing cards, um, the trading cards, they're trading cards, yeah. um, all right, I want, I'm looking for something with a little more substance, I think the best thing I have is uh, somebody keeps asking if police privatization is in our near future? uh, I mean, I guess the question is near, it's inevitable, like privatization of everything, I mean, there will be no, in the in the medium term if things aren't, if the if the arc isn't bent, you know, if if if we don't change the relationship between citizens and capital. everything will be privatized, because there will be no public spear, there will be no public space, there will be no public agreed upon reality, it will be completely replaced by technocratic, technological coersion. and that's when you're talking about like if anyone's read or i've always thought that that book has one of the most chillingly realistic depictions of like America's near future, especially since it's just the current existence in many parts of the world that already exist, which is you have limited areas of of control by certain economic actors who were able to create. works of security and resources for people who provide services for them in the form of employment uh but and then outside of that it's just everybody for themselves in sort of a makeshift uh like return to the hobsy and state of nature but with uh with tiktok all right this is one of the cards here swear to guard is government Canadian national anthem I don't know why the fuck sucking off the Canadians so much here, since 1980, the national Canadian national anthem has been Oh Canada, before then the official anthem had been God save the king or queen, oh Canada was written by Collexia in 1880 for a contest held by a French Canadian organization to select a national anthem. The words in French were written later by Sir, but did not gain wide acceptance till 1908 when they were translated into English by S RS Weer. so keep that in mind when you watch the footage of the highway of death, um, let's do one more, yeah, one more question, um, what, wither hollywood, Matt, what happens with all these, this after this year of zero movies, uh, is there anymore, is this the end of the current? formulation of the Hollywood system uh, I mean it does, it seems inevitable to me, I don't know how Hollywood comes back from this, I mean maybe we get a vaccine and then people go back and there's like this mania for return, but but like in other areas of the economy, the fucking Hollywood was these movies were losing money, you know, comparatively, like the the profit was going down, I mean yeah, like Avengers can make a zillion dollars uh, but but they they concentrate movies like adventures, yeah exactly, like they're concentrating. ridiculous profit fewer and fewer profit making movies that require larger and larger investments to even break even uh and there's there's just been a a steady erosion of of box office uh income over the years like profitability of particular films so that was before covid so i think we're probably going to see a move towards just streaming everything's going to streaming, everything is going to be low budget, forever streaming, you're looking at the future of content people, yeah, and then cloud atless is great, i love the cloud atlas, i love cloud atless too, and then there might be a few movies a year that go to like, i don't even know if they would be theaters, i don't even know like maybe it's like going to be there's going to be like a big screen that comes down at dave and buster's to watch the new Avengers movie, i think movie theaters will forever be around - maybe even as a boutique experience because going to the movies rocks i love going to the movies but there's there is a, it's going to be like you said, it'll be a boutique experience, it'll be like revival houses, like apparently that's how a lot a number of theaters have have been showing old movies during covid, and uh, i could see that as being viable, but there's only going to be a few movies a year, i think that are going to get theatrical releases or are going to be expected to make their money through theatrical release, most of the money is going to be made uh through streaming. I do love going to the movies, I hope I love it too, it's i can't wait, I would love to go back to the out to the movies, I'm not going to go see tent though, uh, yeah, it I do think that they absolutely must uh actually do an oscars this year, yes can win everything, yeah so that trolls two wins beck's best picture uh and cats uh you know uh best direction and stuff like that um I i think they have to do it just because it would be funny. um, you seen tenent in the chat, i thought tenet was impossible to see, not, you could see it elsewhere, and i think there there are like uh, now boot legs available, but it's been released in other countries, it's just not released here, and apparently it is going to be released this week in theaters that are like allow them to be to be viewed, so you will be able to hypothetically see it in the united states, all right, well if you're willing to take your life in your hands, i'm going to pay 4,000 uh dollars to get one of six seats available in an imax theater to stay distanced um all right well this has been a kind of low key just just yeah, this is this is basically a test of uh capacity here, yeah, we're i guess just some programming notes uh, you know, we can't really say much about it, but Matt and i were have been at the office this week uh because we have a fun new project in the pipeline, yes uh, so um, you know, we we might be broadcasting from here a few more times uh than uh usual just because we're coming in here to do some work um the as always the old style of of mat streams, the the the kushflog classic will never disappear, never uh, even if we move to this in a kind of full-time way, uh, we will we will try to always uh or in regular fashion do a big chunk of of mat going off uh solo at the beginning and then maybe do some questions and eventually if i fix that fucking graphics card we can play some games in here, that is the dream, i want to, i want to play some games, but again if you know anything about how to fix the geforce RTX 280 ti uh uh code 43 not recognized by windows uh hit me up and thank you to the person who already messaged oh perfect you're already getting info thank god also um i am running home to go do a music video happy hour stream on my channel uh with molly for and introducing our music podcast that'll start around seven sevenish on twitch.tv/thecriswaid if you want to watch some music videos and have a few drink friday evening come watch us doing a beyonce power hour i believe beyonce power hour yes it's your birthday together a power arrow for her uh and oh i thought it was so funny that that forbes list came out and they put beyonce on the 40 under 40 this year like what why does beyonce need to be on a 40 under 40 list because she's going places she i keep an eye out for this beyonce girl um what else oh uh as i said earlier in the stream but some people might not have seen it i i am the the the kush vlog audio only podcast stream is launched it's not it's it's public but i haven't posted a link to it anywhere, it only has 10 episode, the first 10 episodes in it, over the weekend i'm going to throw all the other 602 episodes and it uh hopefully by the early next week all the kushlogs will be available publicly as podcast in addition to the live stream in addition to their archives on youtube, i think that's all the content news i have, i think you did it, great, you did it buddy, well done, well so are we feeling good, any final thoughts?
