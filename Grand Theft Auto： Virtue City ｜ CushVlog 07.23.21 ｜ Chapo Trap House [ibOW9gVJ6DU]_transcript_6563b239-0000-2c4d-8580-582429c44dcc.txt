 Show me the way to go home, I'm tired and I want to go to bed, I had a little drink about an hour ago and it's gone right. to my head and wherever i may room i land or see or foam, you can always hear me singing a song, show me the way to go home, show me the way to go home, i'm tired and i want to go to bed, i have a little drink about an hour ago, and it's gone right to my head, wherever i may room. by land or sea or f, you can always hear me sing in a song, show me the way to go home, show me the way to go, sorry i want to go to bed, had a little drink about an hour ago, and right to my head, wherever i may room and or see or phone, you will always hear me sing in a song, show me the way to go home, show me the way to go home, I had a little drink about an hour ago, it's gone straight to my head, ever i may roam i ran or see your phone, always hear me sing in a song, show me, got to do it on my phone, it's taking too long on the computer, very irritating. can't spell the name of the damn website either, boy, what is going on here, do not auto correct that please, leave it is one word, thank you, primanny, i walk along the city streets we to walk along with me, but now and every step i take reminds us how in love we used to be, how can i forget you, when there's always something here to remind me, always something here to remind me, i was born to love you, but now and i will ever be free. Always be a part of me, whoa, whoa, whoa, I pass a small cafe where you and I, I would dance at night, boom doom, every dep, mind we all was to kiss and hold you tight, why could i forget you, and there was always something that to remind me, thank you, yes, I'm doing the deon warwick version. not the uh, not the one from the 80s, it's amazing how many new wave songs were like 60s pop uh covers, it really does make you when you look back at a lot of the stuff like punk as a recapitulation of early rock and roll and then like the creation of like - soul and R&B being recreated through new wave, you kind of see how very quickly uh the creative. breaks down and you have to start over again and now we're on like the we're at the terminal end of that i guess tated love is another example of that and yeah there were some mo-town bands that were still performing like the uh the pointer sisters jump for my love that song was huge that's an 80 song but it's also song. I got to say if you want to compare, never mind, anyway, I don't really know anything about music so I shouldn't talk, I'm going out enough on a lim on this bullshit that I should not be going beyond my barest competency, I just know that I like the Deon Warwick version better, which is... uh, it's not the only version because it's it was originally a Bert Backerack song, it was recorded by a number of pop singers. so next week we're going to talk about the rest, the second half of black jackabin or i guess the second two thirds but it reads very fast and uh uh i think it's better talked about uh it it doesn't really require the granular uh focus and if you really do want to talk grannular for uh the haitian revolution in general and and luveture uh as a person i hi recommend the uh recent three part uh Hasian revolution uh a dendom to the age of Napoleon podcast uh that is highly recommended one of my favorite history podcast and if you want to like get into the muck on like the what happened when that's a good way to do it but like talking specifically about what James is talking about. you gets a little more uh abstract uh and I'm finding that like what I'm getting out of this is is our very abstract uh tangents so you don't really need to break it up into specific sections because makes more sense to talk about them as they develop uh throughout the whole narrative but anyway uh the last time I tried to talk about this book I got completely off track did a whole hour and a half uh that was not even directly, there wasn't even gesturing towards the book, so uh, I don't want to let that happen next time, so I I I was reading through and I hit a paragraph that I thought was so perfect in its description of the French revolution, from which the Haitian revolution emerges, and which it is part of, which is why it's part of the narrative of the age of Napoleon podcast, it sums it up in the the uh, the fall of the the end of the revolution, the thermodor. reaction that ends the forward progress towards social equality that the the um that the revolution was pushing, but i felt like this paragraph would cut if people just absorb this paragraph it would cut through a lot of the marass of of weird like emotional reactions and and and investments people have in the figures of the French revolution because now these are... "these are the titans who broke free of their chains, you know, so we we have this, there's this charisma around them uh, but we have they have to be understood not as protagonists, but as emote uh historical actors, you know what I mean, they need first and formost to be viewed is in their historical role, not through the role of what values they personally embody, because then you end up having to defend things uh and conceptualize things historically." around those assumptions, so anyway, I wanted to just have a little bracket here to talk about Robe Spier and the French Revolution, coming off this paragraph that's on page 177 of my paperback copy of the black Jacobbins in the chapter the white slave owners again, which is one of my favorite chapter titles, because it's after the uh the fall of the the slave owning aristocracy, the uh the... declaration by even the the uh republican France itself of of abolition uh saw the disposession of from power of the sort of uh royalist and independence scheaming uh slave owners and by by this time they've been owned but then there's an attempted resurgence to uh regain power uh and he titles the chapter oh the white slave owners again god damn it, i thought we would got rid of these fucking guys, so in describing what's happening in France while the uh while tous is rising to power uh in Haiti, uh James writes Robespear and the mountain, that's uh the the left-wing jacobin uh faction that ended up overthrowing the girandists, in the mountain had maintained power until July 1794. The terror had saved France, but long before July, Robespear had gone far enough and was now lagging behind the revolutionary masses. In the streets of Paris, Jacques Valley and Ruu were preaching communism, not in production, but in distribution, a natural reaction to the profiteering of the new bourgeois. Robespier, however, revolutionary as he was, remained bourjois and had reached the extreme limit of the bourjois revolution. He persecuted the work. far more workers, working men than aristocrats perished in this phase of the terror. in June 1974, the revolutionary armies went a great victory in Belgium, and at once the continuation of the terror was seen by the... public as factional ferocity and not a revolutionary necessity. right-wing and left in the convention combined to strike at this sinister dictator, and when he sent out to the the call to the people, he could not get the old response. some of the sections came, but there was a delay, rain fell and they went back home again. the revolutionary order which had inspired them since August 179 92, was gone, killed by Rob Spier himself. He seems to have been in constant fear of a split between the extreme revolutionists of Paris and rest of the country, but destroyed his own left wing and thereby sealed his own d. and here we have a perfect encapsulation of the how the French revolution ended, it was because the uh the interests of the workers of Paris and the bourgeois, who were challenging royal prerogative in the feudal order, were in alignment for a while. at the start of the revolution, but as the revolution took its own momentum, as the window of possibility opened, the workers started demanding more uh pressing needs, an assertion of greater democratic control of the economy so that they could feed themselves, but the bourgeois revolution, which only seeks to use working class power to the degree that they have to to gain power. uh, essentially puts the breaks on it, and that is because at this point, historically, it is not the workers of Paris, it is not the sound cool out of Paris who are the true revolutionary class, it is the bourgeois class, because they are the ones wh not only are radicalized against the status quo, but have the organizational capacity and the access to power to actually push for their agenda, and they use the... working class of Paris to that end, but then a point came, especially after the Geirandis decided to try to offload this tension in a war with Austria, that passions grew greater, the sense of of loss liberty felt more tangible, and the workers pushed for more radical demands, which at the first place could be uh in a bourgeois framework only accommodated with blood, because remember the... is not trying to create social equality here, they are not trying to do a communism, they are trying to do a capitalism. in their mind, capitalism and freedom are the same thing. this is the founding birth of, this is the explosion of modern capitalist, the modern capitalist capitalist dominion right here, it's bursting forth from the french, from the french uh bourgeois, and so their domination of the uh of the uh national assembly, their domination of all of the political clubs in the city of Paris and in the surrounding cities of France meant that popular uh uh popular agitation by the working class who have a different interest than the fucking bourjois uh which is hey how about we eat, how about we we aren't sacrificed to the market? and the bourjois state would now in the hand, the state mechanism now fully in the hands of the bourjois, remember there's no real working class participation in government in this new structure, it is lawyers basically through and through, lawyers and and progressive land owners, that's it, so those are the ones making the decisions and are wielding these forces because of the insufficient organization of the working class, it wasn't even a working class, it was like it was not a working class in Paris, it has to be remembered, it was a post feudal remnant of the fucking uh, the craft system, you had artisans, the songat were artisans in Paris, just didn't have enough work and were hungry, so you don't have a working class, you have a movement towards one, but it's not coherent, there is a coherent bourgeois class and look at that, they're in charge of the power and the first group to take power are the uh jirandists who squeeze out the fuulantist, the royalist bourgeois when it becomes untenable to support the system anymore, because if you cannot change the conditions at the base, which the bourgeois cannot do, the redistribution of power and resources, what they have to do instead is change the political structure in such a way to validate that to the... the political ritual performance of the... power of the people, let's say that, like we cannot give you pure, you people, you cannot have real power, what we can give you is the performance of power publicly through our guiding hand, you will fill the bellows, but we will be the machine, because we can do that for you, and that means hey, you guys hate the king, he's gone, uh, and so that means that the royalist uh, the pro-royalist constitutional democrats get skipped, get or uh uh liberals get bounced by barnov, then you got a brisseau and his boys in the Jaron, they're willing to go to kill the king, cut the king's fucking head off, damn right, uh, hell, you know what, they'll even go to war with Austria to have a good cleansing patriotic nationalist uh uh ritual that will make their power uh conceived of not as a class but as a nation state or as members of some nation state in in a in a patriotic war. that they will then go and fight it and and not be in the capital for, that's great, but the very the fact that the war didn't go well in the first stages meant that panic exploded and fear of retribution and reassertion of royal power became greater, which means that the bourgeois structure had to do more performances of worker power, of of of sankulat uh political desire only in the form of ritual sacrifice, they couldn't give them land, Mark said this too, they couldn't give them land so they gave him heads and robspier rose to power in that moment because he believed that this was not just some cynical appeasement of the people, he believed that this was going to create communism. Robespier thought that he was going to turn the bourgeois state into a Russowian perfected state, not by changing economic relationships, because he is a liberal, the first liberal in many ways, the first real liberals uh, because he couldn't do it through redistribution, he would do it through the use of the state to assert a public virtue, a internal uh uh motivator, this is what i'm talking about, the thing you're supposed to have at the end of the process of a class formation where the working class takes rule, takes over the machinery of capitalism, puts it to social use and creates a social being right, the new man of the... vision, like it literally is a different type of person with different relationships that are defined by their different economic conditions, the conditions of production that they live within. Robespier thought he could get that within capitalism, even though capitalism is based on this exploitation at the center and this coersion at the center that rips apart consent. Who wants to consent to this system? The consent has to be reaffirmed and reforged culturally. in the form of politics, in the form of laws and uh and punishments, most of all, punishments, and it will be by assertion of a public will to punish, that you will instill in people virtue, they will be scared, they will be scared of the state from sinning, the same way that the medieval uh peasant was scared to sin uh, because he was afraid of... sending him to hell, if we now are going to have earthly institutions now that they've been brought to earth by the emergence of capitalism and the engagement and the alienating effect of the market. if that's the case, are we going to let the market destroy us? are we going to let the market dissolve our humanity? and the radical bourgeois are those who because of their personal collection of uh of of abilities, values, encounters with the world. refuse to accept that and want to defeat it, and those become your liberals. They think public application of fear will reproduce God, will will will, like the way Bentham reconfigured the penitentiary to be away from imagining the uh penitent in God's eyes, but to have them imagine themselves under the eye of a fellow person in the form of the panopticon within the uh the the center prison spoke. and so then if that happens, if everyone within a system is in the system of capitalism is self-regulating, if their decisions are self-regulating towards the good in an abstract sense and not themselves, then capitalism can work, no boss will exploit a worker, nobody will will uh maximize profit over human. their social endeavor, Ray Crock was a fucking heartless demon, because he's further along in the alienating process that Jacobs and fucking bonapart, or I'm sorry, Jacobs and Robspear saw coming and wanted to stop, and they thought that public virtue would do it, that is why, well there was mass confiscation of church lands and persecution of the church and a lot of the uh, the future editors i would guess of liberalism who wanted to tear up the fucking uh church root and branch from society being a more humanist in a many in a meaningful sense liberal than them said no no you can't just replace god with absolutely nothing you have to consecrate their relationship to the state which is replacing god and that is why he created the cult of the supreme being which led to one of uh his real downfall in many ways came from his but is conducting of this attempt to enshrive the this new revolutionary liberalism where the state is still under operating under the machinery of capitalism which is stripping all human bonds, stripping away towards uh selfishness, but and therefore people's lives are worse, they're pissed off. this guy, rob speir says, we're going to all worship this uh, this concept of reason that is the collective understanding of. of our people uh and that that will guide us the way that God used to guide us, and he had a big festival in in uh paris and it was a cringe fest, he had this big float, he was incredibly happy and everyone around and was muttering and and he got heckled at the thing, and shortly after that he had a one of his many nervous breakdowns and he was off the public stage for a few weeks and then he came back talking about how he was going to finally clean house uh and everybody was terrified that their corruption was going to be ex got together to fucking uh nerf him, and there was nobody there to defend him, because this is the important thing about Robespier, in his uh pursuit of public virtue imposed from above on the principles of the bourgeois capitalist state, that meant yes, cutting off the head of a bunch of royalists and the old girandists and anybody who uh looked a scance at the revolution, but it also meant cutting off the head of a bear, cutting off the head of Danton, cutting off the head of anyone connected to the actual streets and the actual demands of the workers uh uh from the machinery of state anybody who was even if they were crooked and Danton was a croook had a public he was he was seen as a legitimate broker for the desires of the people so was a bair and they were also chopped up they were also fed to the machine and doing that broke the the the conveyor belt between the bourgeois state and the sankulat, they were no longer able to uh within uh, they could no longer marshal the people because the people no longer had faith in the mechanisms that they had used to pursue power, and so they lost heart. oh, we're no longer actually in charge of this thing, because when we say things they're not heard, because the people who used to hear them and take them to power and press our case are now dead. it's very similar to what happened uh, in in the United States. after the 1970s in the less frought environment of you know just the post war uh cold war state liberal state, eventually there becomes a point where it uh the crisis is too great, the material uh disruption of capitalism is too deeply felt in the culture uh that you can no longer afford to let the workers, the the the unorganized the proletarians in the room, the pla in the room, you can't let them in, you got to keep it among the bourgeois to prevent uh them from turning them against each other, and because the the bourgeois class is the progressive class at that point, they were the progressive class of the moment, they were able to defeat the workers, the fact that the workers lost proves they weren't ready to win, because the progressive party was the blueu party, and what that meant is that thermodor is the system. stabilizing itself away from the maximalist fantasies of Robespear, which were going to keep going until they hit a reaction, buse he was trying to totalize something, he was trying truly as William F Buckly used to say, to eminotize the escaton, he was trying to transcend the the arc of history, and because he's a liberal idealist, he was going to do that until the system stopped him, and the thing is it did, he found the limit, everybody who was really truly connected to the working class, anybody who had any real convictions about the revolution that transcended personal interest, they were all dead by the fall of Robesbear. Everybody who cowed Robesbear on the left or the right, shared one thing in common, they were essentially more. interested in saving their asses than in maintaining their commitment to the revolution. ironically Robespear's pursuit of virtue squas squeezed virtue out of the system. anyone with the virtue of their convictions got their heads cut off, the only people left were the non-virtuous, and that is what capitalism will do over time, and that's why it this undermines its own social foundations, that's why it sells the root, the the rope for its own hanging. and so what happens with Robesbear is he essentially gets beyond to the point of his historical relevance and then he's fucking uh he's he's removed because uh he is not he is not structured by the the demands of the bourgeois state which are towards stability not civil war with the bourgeois over who is most virtuous while virtue is squeezed out of the system by the machinery of capitalist. giving lie to every revolutionary belief, the the revolutionary uh faith in the in the in the uh in the state that the masses used to have is every day being drained as it fails to make things better to their lives, and of course those people who like i said, the when i say that they uh value their lives more than their principles, that doesn't mean they were bad people, most of us value our lives more than our principles. "the point of having a society is to encourage people's best selves, to encourage their themselves to when given a choice between the right and the wrong thing, which they can feel in their heart, they choose right, and that means that they give people the social context where it it doesn't cost to be good, where there's actually a social benefit of being good, because otherwise you only you create a system that is incentivizing sadists and marters, massacists and are the only people can thrive in that situation and that one uh that the third reaction that uh that took over after uh Robespier yes these were these people had less uh literally less virtue than Robespear who was filled with virtue. he thought he could impose his virtue on others, but you can't, that's the reality of life, no, we're all built different, we all have different capacities for different things based on our individual experiences, and that's why we need intervening structures to guide our day-to-day activity and to reproduce socially beneficial actions and minimize uh socially negative ones, and that is a functioning state that distributes without or with while minimizing and moving towards the limit. of alienation instead of maximizing it and increasing it by the moment, which is what capitalism does, and in those early stages, it's incredibly painful, that's why you have revolutions and ferment and throughout all of Europe in the 17th and 1800s is because this is the moment when these societies being ripped in half, and there's this big explosion, but in the explosion, the bourgeois party is always the progressive force because it's the most self-aware, it's the most self-conscious and they are able to use that self-conscious. 1794, they they many ways viewed the french revolution as the first as the model for the Russian one, in that you were facing a similar situation where the crisis of an order had occurred and classes were now in. what happened that time and what guys like Lenin and assumed would have to happen historically is that because in the Russian context the working... class party, the working class was more organized and was more progressive than the boujois class that they would win, and they did, because in the specific context of Russia, the working class, even though it was a small fraction of the population uh, was more progressive than the bourgeois, because not be uh, but but and I think that there was an assumption, that because this was true in Russia, it was true throughout capitalism, but I think that if you understand uh, you understand the the inputting of capitalism into the system as as something that occurs in stages and across geography and time, which means that development happens in different places at different rates, even though the general trend is moving in one direction, and you have capitalism moving throughout throughout the systems of different states as they all compete with one another, but at different rates because of different conditions, and what that meant is that the uh the working class which had just emerged uh in the late 1800s. brought so many people in Russia so close together so quickly uh and hooked them into a social network of uh political parties and uh mass media that had been created by a bourgeois that was a fraction a sliver of the size that it was in more developed historically capitalist regions like central or like western Europe where you'd had this the the fucking bourjois had been in the catbird seat. ruling capitalism in the in in the in the sturps since it began basically whereas you uh the the crisis of capitalism in the emergence of capitalism in late 19th century Russia is essentially capitalism showing up on the doorstep of a feudal regime and telling an a uh feudal autocrat that he had to institute capitalism if he wanted to keep his fucking country together and that meant that that "it was all instituted by Fiat, by the state, it didn't emerge from social relations and the existing networks of trade that formed the basis of bourgeois social order in the west, uneven and combined development, as they say, and so in the specific case of Russia, yes, the production was true, the the the working class was more organized because there were more of them, they had access to basically the same social structures as the as the bujois class." uh and therefore they were able to overcome you know the fact that they generally had less access to education with numbers and effective technological communication of those numbers into power. that's the important thing. all the french revolutionary sankulat had was the Jacobin club or the kai or the uh oh what the fuck is it called the club decordelier that's it? so like you saw what what happened in 1905 was was the closest thing they had to a bourgeois revolution but it didn't take because the working class the bourgeois well obviously running at a higher temperature than the the um the working class at that time had so few numbers that their ability to assert control was dissipated in very very quickly and was autocracy was able reassert power because it wasn't a powerful enough current in that in that structure in that specific context of capitalist development and so a lot of the things that people predicted were going to happen uh in western Europe in in the in the gap between the first uh social revolution of bourjois power and then the second or the first revolution of the bourjois revolution and then the social revolution that comes later in that interval the... complete the process, the bloody and horrible process of asserting uh this new detorratorialized humanity, capitalism is basically supposed to uproot the human race, grab it out and uproot it, and then that uprooted human race through the fact that now it is able to interact cybernetically. in a way it wasn't before because of technology and mass culture uh and and mass identity are able to build working class counter uh counterhegem that then takes over the machine, but the uprooting is to be done in that interval between the bourgeois revolution and the social revolution so that the social revolutionaries can take over a state capable of redistributing labor through the system in a way that is unalienating and or less alienating and promises to decrease alienation over time. I think if you want to explain what uh why the Cuban revolution has been so resilient, a big one is that in its immediate aftermath things got dramatically better for poor people, dramatically better. Of course, it's it stagnated and it hit a uh that progress was stopped, strangled by the United States as much as it could be, but there's still social progress, it's just, but the and initial sense of momentum coupled with social institutions that don't alienate people because they seem to be to their benefit like democratic uh democratic norms, not not multi-party bullshit like we have, but you know like the direct democracy of the the direct like community involvement, and the thing is you say, oh, they're not really voting for anything, but the thing is, if it feels like the state is working for them, then they feel like they had something to say, they feel like they participated, so they are less alienated from their democracy than we are, because we know that what we want doesn't matter, and we're still supposed to invest ourself completely in the... political contest far less democracy here because we believe in it less and that's because nothing has made anybody's life better in any way since the uh end of the free real estate uh bonanza of the post war empire since they started to have to redistribute the flows, and of course these bolsevics were all very well aware that if they took power. from the bourgeois in 1917 because they were unable to hold it, which they were, they were unable to hold power, that it would be uh monstrous counter revolution and probably some sort of uh genocide, because if the black hundreds had gone hogwild in the pail of settlement after 1905, what would we they have done after uh after that? so that's why the bulsheviks felt they had to sease power, and they had been in un uneasy alliance uh through the provisional government with the bourgeois class and then they betrayed the bourgeois the same way the bourjois had betrayed uh the French proletariat in uh or protoproletarian in 1794 and the way that they betrayed them uh in 1848 but the the the tables turned because historical forces had changed but the the tragedy was is that what the bulshevics had put in in put in to fill in the... the problem here because they haven't done shit to uproot the Russian people, the Russian people are rooted as fuck, that means that they would have to do the uprooting and therefore delegitimize the state into mass numbers of people, they're delegitimizing the state to the people who suffer, and you say, oh, no, but uh, that's just because they're coulocks or something, it's like, your regular person, some new power takes place, they say, we're on your side, and then things get worse for you, you don't believe. it anymore and it's like they had to do it to keep the state right, but they undermined it's legitimacy, what was supposed to fill that gap of legitimacy was the world revolution that's going to start in Germany and allow them to uproot more slowly to ease out of the root, but you can only do that with a vastly more developed capitalist structure, technological structure, concentration of... capital than post-revolutionary Russia had left to themselves in the competitive state framework, they were going to have to uproot the same way the capitalists had, only not in countries across the ocean to people of a different color and god, to your own fucking people, to the people, the only people you're supposed to care about. and that happened because not everybody was uh more developed and the working class never developed the uh in the west, they were they were always kept too comfortable, they were kept too well fed, and that's not their fault, this is the decision everybody is going to make, and this is why Robesby is fundamentally wrong, and why you cannot maintain virtue in a political system based on? people's definition of virtue is in not removable from their self-interest, there is not a virtue, there's not a conception of... that is outside when someone is imagining what the right thing is, what the what what they're going to do, what the how they're going to respond to the world around them, the good and the bad are built into and wired into self-interest, personal, sensual self-interest, and when i say sensual, i don't just mean erotic shit or glutny, i mean security, safety, not having to do unpleasant physical activities like, filling uh, digging a ditch or standing behind a donkey, building a fucking bridge with your bare hand. and our preference for some activities and feelings and sensations and emotions over others defines a idea of what the right and wrong in any situation is, and so if we're in a social order like capitalism, the prioritizes individual gain that does not allow one to have any investment emotionally in the idea not only that other people matter, but that if I help them, it would do me any fucking good, I would only be punished for it, I would have to do it out of... virtue i would have to do it out of pure non uh self-interested desire, which is we think to be superior somehow to fleshly desire, they are in uh, completely inseparable, and the thing is is you want to say, oh yeah, but I'm uh, I'm a calvinist, I'm a self-flagulating celvinist, uh, I, I hate sensuality of all kinds, guess what, bitch, you have just eroticized. your super ego, you're getting pleasure out of it the same way that a headness does out of their glutony because you've rewired your pleasure center around your idea that you can represent goodness outside of yourself and therefore be uh be um put in the sight of God who you imagine as these abstract things unconnected to flesh and earth, sorry these things are all one, these things are all fucking one and so even even even even the most virtue loving liberal like Robespear, look what happened, he allowed himself to be overtaken by uh by cynics uh by by self dealers by by the Luke warm who should be spewed out of the mouth uh because he couldn't read the fucking. at the end of the day and he couldn't accept for himself that he was a presider over a bourgeois revolution, which means at the end of the day he was more committed to a prince a society based on exploitation than he was on trying to uh resisted any further, he was going to have to come to terms with the limits of his interests and their coordinate and and his interest connection to a group of people that he was not connected to, he didn't live among them, live in their conditions, he didn't have their social reality, he was a fucking country lawyer, like all of them were basically, and so he did not have the experience to anchor him, so he fought for this unmored liberal virtue until reality caught up with him and he was destroyed by the synics who then presided over a state that had been delegitimized and could only be reconsecrated in blood, but it couldn't be the the the blood of the people anymore, it would be the blood of Europe and and the form of napoleon's wars that solved the social problem through colonial neo like uh sort of pre-colonial i guess you'd say like what what was allowed in Europe before uh they all decided hey you know what we're going to do all that fighting in the in the in the colonial world we're not we're not going to go after our own territory you can kind of see the the congress of Vienna is that is Napolian is an attempt to turn the liberal bourgeois project into a self-sustaining one through. conquest, but within Europe, and they all decided, okay, no, that's not going to work, we have too much power, basically, these concentrations, the British, the Russians, the Prussians, the Austrians, they couldn't be reduced, because you couldn't, there's no way you can imperially dominate Europe for geographic reasons and so this this stailmate occurs and so the stalemate is solved with the colonies, the stalem is solved by competing for resources in the... the world to sustain the bourgeois state in the face of its mounting contradictions and so napoleon is the first one to say, hey, we'll do it in house, but then was tamed by the angle, the anglosphere which said, no, no, no, we're not doing it in house, we're doing it colonial style, and that's why if you want to point to where capitalism was doomed, it was when it was unmored from the continent, it meant that it had become, it had gone from a progressive engine of social change that was to a cancer vector when the fucking anglos beat the french, because the angles connected capitalism in Europe, which had been limited by the social uh friction that was created by its creation, that was created by its development, could be soothed with the blood, lubricated with the blood of other people and other places, and then and then the people could just be soothed out of their angst and that's what has been happening to the western uh proletarian ever since i know the some say oh that's my third world is sound like jasekai? no, because those people attach all of it to this wheel of uh of uh frankly liberal moralism that says these are all, this is all a tale of who is good and bad, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, this is a tale of where people end up in the fucking uh dice throw of life, the point, what communism does is it doesn't make people better. what communism would do is it would allow regular people who are not good or bad, would lead them to make the good choice more than the bad one, because it would not just be the right thing to do abstractly, it would do their lives better by doing it, it would be the logical, the rational, the self-interested thing to do, and that is what, that's what the entire marxist teleology points to, because what? that is, is a machinery to make humanity work as a species and not as a collection of individuated consciousness, which is not it, that is a lower level of development, that is a lower level of consciousness, it's an alignment of incentives, exactly, and under capitalism, the alignment of incentives is to strip virtue out of the system, and so that is why liberals within this thing cling to virtue more and more. as the vice infiltrates, and that is why the conservative is untroubled by these questions, because to them, glettony, vice has become the virtue because their underlying uh economic presbus is not that they deserve it because they're good people, they deserve it because they're strong people, they deserve it because they are hierarchically better people, stripped of any sort of ritual uh consecrated meritocracy that is all smoke and mirrors, all who do a literal social ritual for bored people sitting in offices to do to feel less bad about being in the system they are, the people who don't feel bad about it, have turned vice into virtue, have turned the enactment of their uh every selfish desire and like basically selfish like... what whatever allows it that i i have to spend the least amount of my time uh uh in the like a starbucks drive through like absolute selfishness that to them is virtue they don't have a fucking superego it's been dissolved and now we have this civil war at the end of a extinguished liberalism and extinguished capitalism that should have been destroyed by now and has not we have this machine that is running itself, while we're all freaking out inside of it, because we might have passed the point where the machine became self-aware, honestly, and so we're all freaking out in the hole of this is this uh, the the uh, we're all freaking out inside the the 2001 ship, hall has decided to shoot us out of the airlock to make things more efficient and to make more profit in the third quarter, even though there's nobody, there's going to be nobody to fucking spend it. and our our politics reflect that, it's a bunch of people in a ship that's slashed the mass has been lashed or the the uh in a big spaceship that has been pointed towards the sun, but we still have to sit around in here and like pretend that our councils of state and our political rituals matter, and so we decide, all right, i am strapped to this wheel, am i going to enjoy it, in what way am i going to enjoy this, am i going to enjoy it by pursuing indulgence? give me the app platter, give me give me my give me all my treats, i want to drive, i want to coll roll, i want to, i want to, i want to use a air conditioner in every room, i want to be as physically comfortable as possible and feel good about it, so i will create a political culture around hating people who think i'm bad for doing this because i know i am and i'm trying to deny that and so i had to have to displace my hatred of my my revolution of myself onto others. uh or are you a fucking sicco lib who is decided that um that they are the the the only people who deserve power because they're the only good people in the country and that if if if bad things happen it'll be because they are willing them to happen to bad people and that's the fantasy of of power that we cling to as as we're just strapped as the the bourgeois i should say cling to and the rest of us just have to passively watch this psychodrama play out because because the working class never came together, the effort to do so broke on the shows of capital uh in the late 18, the late 19th century, the late 20th century, and that's the thing, we are we are. living in uncharted territory, i would say people talk about what's late capitalism, what's neoliberalism? what are these terms? how are they different from the regular capitalism? i would just say that they are chronological in the sense that they document capitalism, once capital, capitalism has seased to fulfill a progressive social function, which for a long time it did, from its birth in late middle ages and Europe to uh, i would say mid the first. the the first half of the 20th century, maybe later, it actually did fulfill a social role, that it was progressing, it was creating the structures of uprootedness and technological transmission of information and resources and labor saving devices, and technological sophistication of industry and and the ability to coordinate. I think once you get to the microchip revolution, you're there, but the very forces that built this thing also created a technological structure to capitalism that is different from its political structure, that is no longer in human hands in a real sense, and it is that the media, the superstructure basically, everything that you would call a superstructural. because those superstructural processes have been automated, they are now the actual skeleton of of coersion, because they're sending us around, and everything we're doing, all the politics we're creating, all all the all of our civic action is stuck in the backtraft of this, we are only able to react to uh the simulacrum of politics, because all of the real politics is not. political it is technological, it is central banks, it is fiat currency, it's uh, it's the fire sector, it's the entire global marketplace, all of these are automated transactions that are carried out by the price signal being detected by technology and then distributing orders through currency across the world. this is the kind of structure that put to social ends could create a new type of human in in a in a stupid uh lame cringe way of talk putting it, a new type of fucking person, and and liberalism is apocalyptic and nialistic because it seeks to do that absent the necessary transition away from capitalism and into socialism, which they resist because their best self-interest is still pleasure. they have of course have a ritual of wanting to deny it and some things they do deny themselves, but they will you know what they don't deny themselves, unaalienated labor, they're not alien, they're not fucking doing that, the idea of doing work that could be unpleasant, that could be uh exhausting, that could be not creatively rewarding, that could be physical, that could be physically alienating, they're not giving that up, and since they're not giving that up, all of their politics. is a fucking performance to obscure that fact, and that's all we get to watch, because there is no working class counter hegemonic culture to to transmit to people who see themselves no longer as workers, but as consumers, because they have been brought to that point by a system that answered every political conflict with more consumption, every every meaningful political conflict in England, in the United States results in uh increased consumption. now in Europe, for most of its history, all all the really big concentrations of political uh conflict erupt in violence in the form of wars and attempts to conquest. the United States that only happened once, the rest of the time it was pushed off into uh border wars against non-subject people that led to increased consumption, decreased liberty in the way. that the yomen imagine themselves to be uh possessing, which is that unalienated sense that the the the sense that I can work myself on the land, like this is the peasant mind, the dream, absent, the the the landlord is to be my own baron, because that's the only model for freedom they have is a baron, and so they come to America and they all try to be barrens and every time there becomes a thing where they might not be able to be not even be. barons, but imagine that they could be the barons, somebody else dies, somebody else is is uh colonized, another regime falls, Europe blows up, oh boy, that's your... convenient for us and we become the the the the globe uh the globe bestriting colossis and instead of capitalism trying to meet local needs as they emerge the way it did in Europe, capitalism after the war develops according to the needs of this centralized system that has politically directed all the the machines of capitalism towards one aim, surplus, yes, the extraction of surplus value, but then that surplus value having some of having some percentage of it funned into the non-productive class to keep them from gaining uh sufficient revolutionary class consciousness and now and that meant that there was no coherence to the working class of the world as they came into being uh in the the bloody exploitative colonial context of the post war cold war which meant that their social movements became entwined with nationalism and with these uh like war lord political parties that that meant that they could not and especially in a context where the US was a total economic war uh with the communist block there was no hope for them to spring up because this central force was dominating and was using its resources to do so and it's technological sophistication and there was insufficient technological sophistication among the Soviets. because they were not supposed to be there, they were supposed to be the beneficiaries of this global system, they weren't supposed to be the centers of it, because they what were they supposed to direct it towards, there was no central objective, in America there was a central objective, cap uh the maintenance of these structures and that meant, you have a problem, give them more to eat, give them more to buy, give them more dreams that they can become rich, first the stock markets in the 20s, then the the uh the... the good union then the the more importantly than anything the the second uh the second - the gi bill and the second homestead act basically which is what created the uh the suburban working class home owner and of course things like that were happening in Europe too uh hell it was the American uh the American state that broke up the large uh concentrated feudal land owners in Japan after World War II uh and then gave everybody. a little thief and gave them a chance to to conduct this sort of phantom economy of exchange within a system where all the real work was being done outside of it and all of the real uh resource exploitation was being done outside of it. all that was really happening at the center is consumption and then the economy that has to exist to facilitate that consumption that has to circulate the capital through the system to keep all those signals up and to keep the machinery moving things through the shoots. and so the tragedy of Robespear to get back to him is that he was he embodied his moment but so much so that his belief in the moment transcended even his ability to perceive his immediate interests or his own his own conviction in his material interests. Rubspeare probably didn't really care if he died because he'd been halloed out by his belief but That's a very rare dude, and they get thrown up by the time, but the machinery, the incentive structure that is always there under capitalism means that you're always sorting towards the most soulless, the most cynical towards the top, because the people who uh who care about something, that might allow them to resist capitals encroachment are being eaten away, literally, the being their heads chopped off, they're failing to advance, what it remains are those who have a idea of virtue that conforms to success under capitalism. and we're all operating under those conditions, and that's why virtue is is is a is a is a frago and something that can't be uh uh chased, because nobody's, it's not about people being better than other people, it's not and and it's like i said, it's not even to say that that subjects under socialism would socialism would be better people, they would be? people who would be more likely to do good things because the system rewards it and here's the important second part of that is that having that happen over and over again changes at a fundamental level what you would have done in a given situation gives you more pleasure to see the affirmation of this system than to get a narrow self-interested point and that is where it becomes self generating and turning people and and look inside themselves and have a transformation. it is not millenniary or pentecostal, it is that the system incentivises them to make good decisions. good with a capital g, not good, see we have that nudge system, we have guys like cas sunstein saying, oh we need to nudge people in the right direction, but they're not talking about good with a big g, they're talking about small g economic good, which of course is bad, is destructive, is suicidal. and it is the contract, it is the cognitive dissonance of trying to figure out the fact that we have literally labeled good for bad socially and reinforced bad behavior exclusively while still believing that we're upholding a system that generates virtue means that we have to continually create greater and greater fantasies in our mind and jump through more and more uh mental hurdles to justify ourselves and i really think that the hysteria of uh the hysteria of virtue mongering among liberals is this says playing out, okay, i hope that made some sense, so yeah, you can't, you have to change the you, you're operated by an algorithm. either way, like it really, there's no choice, the singularity does occur, like the singularity, the technological singularity is real, the only question is when the two fuse, which one is uh, in the driver seat and which one is in the back, which one is which which one provides the uh, which one provides the feedback that creates the conditions that will op? the technology, is it us in the form of human need expressed through the social institutions and religious and civic concepts that move us through life that nudge us in a direction as we follow the orders really of a technological technological neuro superstructure that that pushes us through amaze what's going to push us through no matter what the dream that there's not going to be amaze is the dream of the yoman, it's the yoman fantasy, it's it's the pre-capitalist, landed dream, and that is not, it's not compatible with humanity as it exists, we have been up rooted come from the earth, we could not reestablish ourself in it without destroying so many of us, without killing so many of us that the structures that would be left from that would be fucking monstrous and would only bring about more destruction, would only eat up everything and until it was gone, that is the that's the carcinogenic model for human civilization, and it was strapped to this social order that became uh eventually obsolete, and it is now programming our entire uh technological infrastructure, and if it continues to, we'll get to a point where there's no people left except for some assholes strapped to a uh fucking uh like duct taped some guy in a in a giant tower uh strapped to some uh VR headset with a goddamn flashlight on that he thinks is the internet and he's there getting like paste uh uh fed through to him through a tube and he thinks that he's living immortally in the machine until some you know they just there's a there's a uh there's an energy pulse in sector four and the fucking uh the lights go out and he just fucking dies and then everything else is a machine that is still grinding off that is still... where the where it's still where the where it still is power through it is still moving things back and forth through still sending drones in the sky, still protecting borders that are no longer acknowledged by any living thing, in the year 25-25 a cheesy song, but they they knew that they knew the score, or we stick around and the machines, the machinery fuses. with us in the sense that it does what we wanted to do, it becomes an extension of us, not an individual person, but an extension of a will, and that's the that's the uh a i think that uh Kim Stanley Robin, I haven't read his his books about uh or like in banks too, the the society or the culture, that kind of thing. but of course all that stuff is just purely theoretical, we'll never see any of that, we'll probably see, we'll probably never see any of those outcomes. but in some universe they got they happened because in some universe everything happened, probably not this one, but in one universe out there that happens, both of those cases, we're going to be somewhere in the spectrum, and what that means is we're going to keep collapsing, breaking up in this cycle until we either run out and are no longer viable as a species, and then something else happens, we get cephalopods in another 100 thousand years and maybe they go to the moon. go to the space and they become whatever or it just cycles through low-level non-intelligent species until the sun explodes, it doesn't do anything to uh, that doesn't do anything to the human consciousness, it doesn't do anything to the to our understanding of the world because because we're here now, i know that sounds dumb, but it means that. I don't know, I can never really articulate it. I just have this weird, I really should know more about Astro physics because I've heard about this stuff about like time, time going backwards in some direction or time going backwards in some instances and like being detected as going backwards and and and like causality being reversed uh or breaking down in the quantum realm and I think about the idea that if the universe is like one consciousness slash substance, if it is one thing and we are like within it experiencing it subjectively, then it it really could be the fact that it is the it is consciousness, it is perception of the universe that makes it real. I'm not gonna learn anything, someone says learn civic engineering, I'm not not going to learn anything, dude, that time has passed, I will, I mean not anything that exalted, like I'm maybe I'm gna learn some stuff that like might help me you know do a fucking garden, maybe learn how to build a bench, I'm not gonna learn anything, it's just you know some vocabulary words is basically what I'm looking for, yeah I'm gonna build a fucking bridge. i i count with my fingers, what the fuck are you think you're talking to? yes, but yeah, the universe exists because it's being observed by us, so maybe that means that no matter how hard it imagines to believe, no hard no no matter how hard it seems to believe that this could be the world where we pull it off. man, maybe the only reason we're here experiencing this is because somewhere did get pulled off, somewhere we can connect to, and if that's the case, then you are absolutely obligated by every sense of self-interest, personal, sensual, spiritual, you are incentivized to do the to do the right thing, and you'll know what that is. All right, yeah, I'm gonna go off, I'm gonna go off and I'm gonna go uh, I'm gonna go uh, get one of those home correspondence courses to learn about astrophysics, I'm gonna like read some wikipedia pages. good lord, do the right sensual thing, yes, bye.
