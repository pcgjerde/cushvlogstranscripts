 Oh hoy, hoy, I'm assuming folks are there, I don't have my computer out here yet, so I'm hoping. that uh that I'm being received here, I've exited host mode, I don't know when, I can never tell when, but I know now that I have exited host mode, I've exited post malone, hey everybody, getting my seasonal allergies on, this time of year, around September, the rag weed. rises up and i start sneezing and getting uh and getting a little uh stuffed up, happens in the spring too. uh, and as folks can see i am back wearing my strak suit because it's finally kind of chilly, it's kind of fallish, and i got to say this is very rare for New York. i know half the country is on fire and we're tumbling into a climate apocalypse, but man last month or so in New York, met in a half has been exquisite uh, i've lived new york probably five years between two five six years now between two different times living here and i got to say this is the absolute best august i've ever encountered and the best september because in New York September is usually very muggy here even if the temperature goes down and you don't get crispness until like october at least my experience this is already crispy and it's not even the 15th yet oh it's fall baby and i'm loving it and here i am and wearing my motherfucking tracksuit and i love it i love it someone tells me the streams I've been told this before, I have the volume entirely up, I have the microphone next to my face. If there is another thing to do, I do not know how to do it. So at this point, telling me won't help, because I do not have the ability to interfere with this. Now, as we've said, we're going to do more stuff at the office with uh Chris, we're going to try to do a stream I think on Wednesday, we were going to do one last week, but he forgot the microphone, so we will be in the office, I will have the microphone and it will be louder, but until then it's just me here and I don't understand any... of this, i don't know how this works, as remember how long it took me to even get from twit to twitch, which is like a thing of of a platform that we have a uh an actual like deal with to broadcast content, and i was doing it on instagram because i didn't have twitch on my phone, i don't know how any of this works, you guys know when you can get me on? this because I have no power over it, it makes me worry that people don't know what I'm saying. Uh, I am a boomer, I've never said I wasn't. I've never claimed to be anything but a boomer. Uh, because if you think about it, the boomers were the last generation. I mean, we talk about X millennials and stuff, but the boomers were really the first and last generation, because they were the defining generation. there really work generations before them, that's all retrospective, all that stuff about the silent generation and and like the greatest generation, that's all post hack, nobody thought in those terms back then, the first generation is self-consciously think of itself as one, at least in America in the 20th century was the fucking boomers and since they have held on to all the capital they've been squatting crisis like upon it like smog on all of that fucking accumulated capital that that got piled up during the labor piece of America's that is now slowly dwindling away, they still have the lion share of it, which means they still direct culture, they still direct politics, they still rule the roost, and they still, I mean, there's going to be a movie about the Chicago 7 directed by Aaron Sorkin coming out next month on Netflix, Sorkin is a fucking uh Uber exer, right? I'm pretty sure that Sorken is like a definitive gen exer, how old is he? Sorkins in his 50s right, or even. early 60s, he is a fucking exer, but he's still making a movie about the Chicago 7 and about the fucking 68 convention, and and and all of his characters and all of his stuff harken back to that, remember uh, Jeff Daniel's monologue at the beginning of newsroom where he talks about how we were once great and we won wars and we uh, sure he's talking about the greatest generation, but then he's talking about shit like going to the moon and whatever, it's all in the context, those are the dreams of the the greatest generation or the boomers, that was... the stuff the boomer saw, that's what they grew up with, and that's what he's enraptured by, even though he was older, younger than that, or if he wasn't, he should, he shouldn't be. that beholden to it, and now the millennials, they're just, it's all just a different deformation of boomer, it's all that self-conscious, like it's the idea of a generation that sees itself as a generation, right there you have boomer man mindset, so every generation that thinks that way has boomer mindset, so we are all boomers, 100% boomer. even them even the terrifying z zoomers, even the children uh are are basically boomers, i mean there's zoomers at rhymes, it's boomers all the way down, so i will say it, at least i'll admit it, i've burred through the levels of uh of of mystifying ideology that make me think, oh no, i am this generation, these things mean something. other than just a culture talking itself to death while it slowly sinks into oblivion, unable to muster any uh opposition to a neoliberal dissolving of all social and ecological uh uh foundations. I have to say though that I replay these and... sound fine so I don't know what the hell your problem is. I've never had a problem listening to them, either played back on YouTube or twitch, so you guys might have the problem. This might be a YP, not an mp. What are all these emoticons? Why why are we getting emoticons? what's going on? there are many emotacons, some of them are of me, there's one of uh Alex, I think, loan option on there, oh emote only because everyone was giving me the business about the the uh about the sound, well I'm fine now, I now I know that if anyone's doing it, they're doing it uh, as a as some sort of trolling, so I will disregard. Oh no, oh no, god damn it, polmo got it out there again, that there's a picture of me without a beard, and there it's a terrible photograph, it's i think it like it's on some altright websites, I remember you people would sometimes reply to me with it, it's a terrible photograph, it was for a brief period, a couple years ago when I shaved my beard because I was getting too much uh beard dandruff and it was too. and I now now yeah you need beard oil idiot so I take care of it now there's not going to be a Rogan debate come on we're barely even going to get an actual debate it's going to be puppet show they're going to do race band and miles like conan O'brian it's going to be stage managed somehow edited. going to be boring, sure shit not going to get four hours in uh, joe Rogan's weed garage, getting contact highs, while rogan just blows smoke in their face, i am grilling tonight, thank you for asking, i'm going to make the uh, i have i have perfected a recipe for a korean beyond burger where i put kimchi and that sauce that. i have on a beyond burger fry uh cook that puppy up and of course some uh some glizzies nathans the best oh god thank you someone reminded me of this i want to talk about so today trump was in some sort of conference with people in california and of course he's doing his usual thing about forest fires where he says they didn't they didn't sweep the floor enough you got to sweep the floor why don't you sweep the floor you've got to sweep the floor. uh, he's said this for years, this has always been his argument, i mean he's he's a moron, he's he's a great a idiot, accepted being famous, and they were, he was talking to some california officials and one of them decided he was going to get his name in the paper, and so he gave Trump a little dressing down about how he needed to under accept that climate change was real and that he needs that the science needs to be confronted or else we're not going to fix anything and the guy. Trump goes, it's going to get colder, you watch, and the guy goes, I wish science agreed with you, and he goes, well, science doesn't know. That is at the heart I think of Q, of flat earth, of the entire like uh new like folk politics and religion that's emerging in the current moment out of the sludge of Trumpism uh, it is a total disbelief in all objective uh measurements or systems, it is a it is a... Reptilianne rejection of authority outside of one's zone of tribal affiliation, so things like the media, and things like science, any way you define it, are not just not to be believed, they are to be instinctively disbelieved, anything they say is a lie, you have to believe the opposite, and that's because this is what happens when you have replaced the concept of politics with personal. go gratification to the point where you are just projecting a fantasy, a schizophrenic fantasy of politics where you're a participant uh as like an eternal essential being battling against the enemy, not not negotiating with other people across like the marketplace like liberalism says and we're all participating in liberal democracy, but further more and more liberal democracy is untenable, and this is replacing it, and that's one of those things that makes Trump supporters love them is cuuse they think the same way they he does, and so they don't think science is real, and you can say, but what, look at all the evidence and how is he say it going to get colder, it's been the hottest year every year for the last 20, but here's the thing, in a couple months it is going to get colder, right? even if it's not as colder as it used to be at the same time of year, it's going to be colder than it is now, right? those fires are going to go out, right? there might even be some snow, there might even be a snow storm or two. and he will be in that moment then being like, look, it's cooler, crazies, the nuts, what, what's wrong with them, and of course all the nerds are gonna yell, but neck, but but but this is just the winter and it's not even as cold as it used to be, and it's going to keep getting warmer, but right then it's cold, and then next summer, if there's another huge fire season and it's you know bigger than this one, and it's more acres burned, and it's more people displaced and killed, you point to it and you say, look, it's terrible, he'll go, yeah, it'll get cooler, and he will not have, he will not even remember last year, he will not be able to think of last year, because every moment is just that moment, but not in like the zen centered sense of, there is only the moment, everything within it is flux, the only constant is change, and therefore you are free from any fixed position, any any damage, like you cannot be hurt if you really believe that, because there's nothing to hurt. you're part of a, you're part of a a whole, you're part of a flow, a flow of his space and time, and that centers you and can give you a sense of can detach you from your pain and detach you from your anger and detach you from your resentment and hostility to others and fear, but he doesn't have that kind of sense of the moment, it is only the horrors of the moment, it's only the pains and desires and and and and thwarted dreams, the fantasis. that have always been there just out of reach, like remember Trump has been driven mad by having everything he wanted his whole life, which means he has never been happy, because he has always been seeking more, which means he is always moving towards this like this light that's just beyond the his reach beyond like this gauze of reality and he's been pushing at it his whole life and it's made him in every moment miserable, so it's the same moment of misery, and so in the winter... hey, it's cold, what are you talking about global warming, and in the summer when it's hot, you're overreacting, it's going to get cold, and that's a mindset that is now dominant, where the enemy is these things like science and the media, and the political parties, specifically the democrats, hollywood, any all the edifice, all the edifices of the of the fantasy world that we now inhabit that replaced our reality, because our reality is fixed right, politics. can't have anything to do with real human conditions because real human conditions are fixed, our destiny is made by the market, we are frozen in amber, we are going to be turned into paste one way or the other by the system, but we live in a fantasy world, we live in a world of heroes and villains, we live in a mythological realm, and we get to participate at the level of of visceral identification with one side, and that's what the new politics will be, and it's the only politics we can have, that's why q is the leading edge of of a generalizable phenomenon across politics. and includes democrats, like there's already like this Russiate and like the weird fixation on uh like and paranoid relationship to Trump and Bernie Broes in the creation of this like pet metarrative about a conspiracy. within like the inter Russia and the democratic republican party and the media to like elect nats the fascists by propping up a fake left uh that's on the same level of like delusion and it comes from the same level of cognitive dissonance and the same sense of powerless but it's just less intensified now uh because those people are more wetted to more more parts of the system like they still believe in the media they still believe in the democratic party they mostly still like Hollywood whereas the the queue person is already been widely alienated from all of those things, which puts them farther along on the edge, but it's the same process and that's just the language that it's finds itself being generated by the democratic uh um like ideologue and uh this allows me a chance to talk about... something I think I've brought brought mentioned in part before, but I've never, I don't think brought together into one kind of idea, and that is the way that Q fits into the history of protestantism in America, and how q, I think represents a third grade awakening of American protestantism, like a new emergent relationship between people's spirituality and their politics and their like citizenship uh, and it goes like this, this is my basic outline. is that in the first premise is that protestant American protestantism is in essential ways a different beast theologically and spiritually uh from any any christianity that came before it anything in Europe or the levent or anything else uh it is not it is its own creature it is a offshoot and the main reason I say that is because the United States project that Colonial project created a relationship between citizens and Christianity that essentially removed the spiritual element, IE the social element from the entire endeavor of religion and made it a purely transactional relationship, a purely marketized, capitalized religious tradition, where like because religion, because it is the opiant of the masses in the heart of a heartless world, it provides sort of a, it it it ratifies. uh uh existing social relationships, but it also gives rise to a language of uh of this of pain, uh, a language of uh hurt, uh, a language of alienation that was exploited by things like the monster rebellion and fucking uh the civil rights movement, um, and shit, I gotta, one second, I got a... but anyway so yes one second as we leaving off with protestantism different now we will say why am i on can you guys hear me am i back on can you hear me all right you can hear me okay good so christianity is not just it's a social practice and that is something that you have to remember when you're talking about religion, it's not just doctrine, it's a social practice. the social practice of European Christianity through up until the reformation was one where one sense of place in the universe and one sense of one's relationship to God, which is necessary for anyone to feel like they're participating in a religious tradition, if you can't feel God, you're not really part of it, I mean you can it, but you're not there. uh uh and the the way that that was reaffirmed was by a social relationship, you were a member of the great chain of being, you had a place and you that place was reinforced and daily ritualized almost interactions with everyone around you, other people in the great chain of being, family members, you know, clergy, the the lords, whatever it is, whatever your relationship is, it's embedded, it's socially embedded, and those that creates sense of our understanding of God's will, because God cannot be totally inscritable, if God's totally inscritable, we have nothing to go by, if God is totally inscritable, there is no reason to have any code of behavior or any any social obligation to anyone, because what's the what's the uh, what are you going off of? God is explicable to the sense that we know what he likes, and so by seeing people interact socially, we see who rises and falls. it it normalizes and ratifies that exploitation system, but it does it in a way that has a deep sense because of the lack of technology and the lack of social uh alienation uh uh uh it has a larger degree of built in uh um uh built-in legitimacy built in uh consent i would say because people feel obliged to one another and that's part of what religion is, but capitalism changes that, capitalism destroys our relationship with one another, removes the obligations, removes that that sense of of of a mystical tie and replaces it with a transaction of goods, motivated by self-interest, strangers in a marketplace, that's how we're supposed to see each other, and part of it is because you, as as capital is is accumulated, society gets more complicated, more people are... born more people live closer together, they go to cities and stuff, and it pulls at that social fabric, the social fabric gets torn as people move through the economics engine as it as it tightens its grit, and that means that it creates uh alienations, and they have to be channeled somewhere, and protestantism is one way to re reframe one's relationship to God in a desacralized space. Protestantism says, no, social practice is not the basis for a virtue, doctrine is individual belief. is, because if you're carrying your soul around by yourself all day and interacting with other people who might try to take it, as opposed to being socially embedded, where your soul is also a little bit part of everyone else's soul that you know, because you only know a few people, you know more people, you're interacting with them as strangers, you're trying to exploit them, you're trying to get more from them than you're giving, that has to be metabolized, these these people don't just snap more fingers one day and have new ideas, they have to be resolved, these contradictions have to be resolved, and protestantism helps resolve that contradiction by replacing that social soul with an individual one and replacing works with beliefs, but that so that once that process starts, it would inevitably, unless something intervenes, it would inevitably overtake all of European christianity, but it was hyper kicked into gear by the fact that as this new emergent social idea is is emerging, this idea of a protest liberal self as the locus for like religious meaning, as as a way to deal with the dislocations and alienations of capitalism, just at this time Europeans start going to the new world and seeing it as virgin land, seeing the people who inhabit it as somehow other, religiously inscribed as other so that anything can be done to them, and their land is takeable. land is excorporatable, but that means they're coming apart from different places and they might all be christians, they might like like the the people in new England, they might all be christians, you know, but they all come from different places and are strangers to one another, for the most part, you had some families coming, but the vast majority of immigration led to strangers coming into contact with another, one another and creating cities of people coming together without a framework at all, coming from a feudal understanding that was not yet fully like shaken loose from social formations and relationships in Europe, so that had to be filled by something, and the first great awakening that happened during the colonial era, I think was that society's like uh inflection point at which they realize the new understanding of their religion, and a new understanding of their relationship to God, and protestantism and calvinism specifically provided them for the context. for this and provided them for the language with the language for this, and it was, how can we know God's will, right? we used to be able to know God's will, because we were connected, we were all tendrils touching one another in a social fabric, we we were we were, we were a seamless garment, I mean not, obviously this is for, when I say this, this isn't speaks to all the alienation and misery of life under feudalism, it was miserable, it sucked, but all of that. and suitude was channed into this affirming social uh uh network that didn't require a lot of how could there have been mass coersion there was no mass state you had people the surfs if they wanted to leave they could for the most part the misery was massive but it was unalienated it was shared by most like even rich people still had to like they shit twice a month and the and their kids a new world where everyone's a stranger, how do we know what is God's will and how can we act according to it? and the answer became, because this is a blank slate, this is tabula rasa, and we can rewrite anything onto it through our personal will, driven by our personal souls, then God's will is the sum total of what we do to this continent. what all of us acting according to our souls, rights on the continent is the manifestation of God. will and those prosper are prospering because they held in their heart the true fait and the true spirit and are true christians those who fell, those failed to inscribe themselves on the land uh profitably on the landscape, they are they are sinful, we pity them, we don't we hope they find Jesus, but there clearly cannot be real believers or they would not be so fucking poor. and that works for and that re reinscribes christianity and and gives it a new basis to a framework to app operate from in people's minds uh during the course of the settling of the country, but then by the mid-19th century a new system is emerged. now we still have the frontier people pushing it forward and and trying to grab and write their like write their fate, write God's name onto the land, but the people out east, the people who are. the relatively recent immigrants or people who have settled in the less, especially in New York, in the northern tier, the less uh, the people who became the yoman farmers, like where the citizens actually lived, and upstate New York was where the the the second grade awakening was most intense, the burned over district it was called, also where mormonism emerged from, and that is because I theorized it's the Deeri Canal, destabilizing that that rural idol and introducing the market, because the market is another challenger to... our fixedness cuuse like we can inscribe our name on the land, but then what if what about what the banker shows up, what if we have to get a mortgage, what about what what about what our goods will get on the market, or what if i have to sell my labor, what if i have to go to the city and i have to sell my labor and i'm not even able to direct my own efforts the way i could on a farm, i have to go on the barges on the iri canal and see and see tavern keepers like what, how am i to keep my? how am i to know what God's will is there? and the answer ended up inevitably becoming because that's what the wheel of history was grinding us towards with our our consent or knowledge and our brains trying to frantically keep up was what god's will is what is inscribed in the market. so not necessarily the land, but if you can get the land good, but if you can't, well what can you, what can you sell? what can you sell in for how much? what, what, what kind of trade? can you learn and what kind of shingle can you put out? what kind of fortune can you make for yourself? fortune can you make for yourself? and succeeding in the market becomes expression of God's will. failure or god's favor, failure, god's disfavor. and now we've reached a terminal end point to that cycle, because the market has just as our frontier eventually became no longer valuable, couldn't be the place where God's will is inscribed, it became. it became autonomous, same way that happened to the market, because now the market is totalized, which means the winners and losers are fixed, there is not even an illusion of agency, people are just driven by the skinner box desire, fear, external coersive mechanism of the market, the the debt and and and bills and um and hospital costs and healthcare. and um and lower wages and more flexibility and maybe you got to move, you know, but none of it feels, none of it, I'm talking about in a spiritual sense, none of it feels like it's anybody's uh, it's anybody's will, certainly not God's, and instead of accepting a world where God is dead, we have to find a new place where his will can be found, and now we have a new frontier, as another frontier closes, a new frontier opens, the frontie. of the internet where yes we are fixed here in in the cycles deprivation and and fortune and and labor alienation, material alienation, precariity, the word that defines all those words, but online we can seek God's favor, we can scry through, we can put an effort into to truly just believe in something, and so That's where a q comes in, I think, and so this is the new, this is the latest cycle, the new intensification cycle of uh Christianity, American Christianity, whereby now God's will is discovered online, and we find we use things like queue proofs and memes and the queue clock to like we use a a biblical codex or the or the talmed to find meaning to to find the cabalistic code within it. and q is the thing that brings all of it together, and now is knowing to include all of this mystical rejection of material world and its structures that have failed at every level to provide the sucker that uh our understanding of the country we live in and the god who rules over us would make possible, and something has to explain it, someone has to answer for it, and that becomes the shadow form of this like uh cyclopedian de deep state. which of course exists and is capitalism, but these people are too captured ideologically to get beyond that level of abstraction, and I don't how much hope is for them, honestly, I think if you get there, it might be too late also, like you might be deep into a epistemic grut and nothing could route you out, because how can you really convince anybody of something at that point, it's the way I say, you can't convince anybody on the internet anymore, that means the more you believe on internet. stuff the less you can be talked out of it, the way you couldn't talk someone out of a religious belief, they have to be stopped from converting in the first place, or you hope that they fall away from it, but that's going to happen regardless of you, you're not going to talk them out of it discretely, you got to fucking cut it off and you got to get people before they can get it, and that's the race against time the left has and I i'm not terribly optimistic. Yeah, the whole thing was a joke, I mean just was the Trump campaign, the Trump campaign started as a joke, it was basically a bit he was doing because he was pissed Obama, uh, told him he was, he couldn't be president. the problem with trying to get queue people to acknowledge capitalism is the root of a problem is that they believe capitalism is in a capitalism is part of the fiber of the christ like when i was talking about how protestantism is like a spiritual expression of capitalism, it's a spiritual. practice that can be compatible with capitalism uh, that means that it's that they are constitutuative of each other, you cannot get capitalism out of it, you you'd have to, you'd kill it, and and and yeah, like that's, that's how you would have to do it, but it's also means that they're going to have more defense mechanisms against that than anything, they're going to like, any any criticism of capitalism is if they understand it as such, like if they understand it in a spiritual. sense is like a live wire challenge to their very uh existential conception of themselves, and that means it's very, very difficult to uproot. I'm drinking a schwep's black cherry self. I have to say, I used to not like seltsar, I used to prefer soda because I thought like the the unadorned uh selcery taste was too overpowering. I like to sweet, but I've basically waterboarded my mouth with enough of this shit that now I like it. and it and it does most of the job that uh that coke used to do. oh i i wrote a letter box review of invasion of the body snatchers the philip Koffman 70s version and i just said that that if they did one now with this sort of same vibe it would be about tiktok and it's just i don't know i i wasn't even really thinking about it uh the movie is okay i didn't just really have anything to say about it i guess i just meant that uh that that movie much takes uh invasion of the body, the body snatcher are a metaphor for like uh, i think it's supposed to be a metaphor for like self culture and the... like as as the 70s were turning into an insane asylum and as like social cohesion was going out the window and as a as the economic foundation was crumbling around everybody and society felt like it was like on the verge of some sort of tipping point uh certainly economically when you talk about the oil embargo um that there was this movement to south people. out in a without religion, but like with spirituality, like a a a um new age or or um radically like self-accepting psychological, essentially snake oil, like all of that stuff was snake oil, it was just it's the same, it's like it's all dienetics, it's it's all all of it Elron Huber stuff like someone who is charismatic or smart enough to construcked out of like real real pain and real alienation a quick fix remedy that incorporates enough truthful scaffolding to hide the empty inner core uh and that stuff just poliperated and now we don't even have that we just have social media entrepreneurship like the only hope for the prols is that you can do this you can do being on the internet good enough that you can avoid the perils of the market. entirely like i did, i mean i'm exhibit a of this, and and now it it was podcasts, you know, for a while it was uh, like you get a book out of a book deal out of a twitter account, and now it's being a tik took of. I didn't say it was set for life, if I said if I said set for life and I just mean you don't have to, you don't have to worry about becoming a totally alienated uh late capitalist subject just running on the hamster wheel, you can you can disengaged from that at least for a while, and uh, that's the only dream left, that's the only American dream we have, and Q is a part of that, queue is that expression politically, like you can solve the codex, you can you can solve the devinci code and it'll unlock. the fucking seal gond and and the light will shine through and there will be no death and all shall be well and all shall be well and all manners of things shall be well and preser John and his righteous armies will come over the horizon to redeem mankind the revelation these guys are apocalyptic very much exclusively there are like this whole trump unveiiling when all the all the deep state pettows get executed the apocalypse in their mind in the sense that it is the end point, this is the new expression of endtimes uh uh uh um Christianity, remember at the turn of the millennium in the fucking uh left behind series and it was all going to be the rapture, you remember the rapture, the way that was a meme until like 2008 during the Bush years that all the all the Yahoo Christians thought that one day all the all the righteous would just get spared, like they get sucked up to heaven before tribulation began, because as the most coded and and and and uh physically pampered people in history, people who believe that their amount of physical and social suffering is the sum total of like their uh uh like their uh suffering for them would be to be out of God's favor like to suffer it all is to be punished by God to for having done something wrong so they can't even conceive of suffering through uh uh uh tribulation no no they will be rise risen up and they get to watch you don't hear about the rapture anymore, you're going to hear about q, but it's the same impulse, just farther along, accelerated farther along, and made more insane by a more insanely uh, disorienting social matrix, I e social media. Yeah, I really do think it was a shit post, I think the Q is a shit. post to begin with, and then I think it was probably taken by those um, those YouTube, I don't know if people read this, but there was an article that that had a little had some, it looked pretty persuasive, proof video of these two youtubers who were making money, and this is always the big question about Q, why would you do it if there was no money in it because like I'm talking about, the whole the only dream left is the dream of of seasing god getting gaining God's... why it had to be someone with real inside or knowledge and they had to be anonymous because there had to be it had to be for the pure desire to see good done, it couldn't be for social media cloud, but the way to get around that is if you're the person explaining it, if you're the person, if you're the pristhood, if you're the digital priesthood, if you're if you're the uh, i mean, then you get you know the communion and you get to keep or you get to keep the uh the collection plate cuuse you're the priest of your own religion, is what everybody wants, so this sort of elron Huber deal basically, and like mormon, mormon uh, mormon heaven too, uh, and you get to collect the the the gate told for understanding queue in the first place, and there's video of one of these guys accidentally logging onto queue while they were streaming live in one of their well-trafficked and renumerative youtube channels, and now it looks like at some point it got, maybe they sold it, I wouldn't be surprised if they sold it, and honestly. they did, they sold low uh, to that pedophile psycho eightchan guy, but honestly though, i think that if they did sell unless they really needed cash fast uh they blew it, because this could really be like an apple type situation, but the thing that could stop that, and it might be too late, honestly is that because Q has posted so much less as Q has gotten much more popular, his contribution to the whole thing has been uh, uh denatured, he is less integral to the process, most of the stuff that's really important q cannon didn't come from directly or even like through a direct inference from a queue post, and even if he wanted to change the direction or or or like sease control of it for some specific ends that were not, that were against the momentum that was being built socially, they wouldn't be able to do it, it'd be king kenoute trying to call back uh hold back the tide. Now I know American Christianity isn't a single tendency, but I would say that that is the that there is a basis for that Americans, like and I'm not talking about the way it's experienced by non-traditional people, I'm talking about the way that it is practiced by practitioners of religion, like people go to church, or even people who have a very, very deep, self-conception of them as Christian. as a subset of greater group of people that you could ev you could still call Christian uh that there is an American protestant uh cosmology like a materialist christianity where God's will is seen on earth, heaven is on earth, hell is on earth, and who is one place or the other is God's will, because we are all driven by our own souls towards light or darkness. and that's and obviously not everyone thinks that, there's plenty of people who don't believe that, but I'm talking about like the the the underst not just the way people the majority of people understand themselves, but the way that they're at understanding expresses itself in politics and culture, I would say that that is American Christianity, this protestant evangelical conception and that even catholicism at this point for the most part uh, accepting like... maybe immigrant communities, where by the way, pentecostalism and evangelicalism is making a big uh uh inroads. American Catholicism is essentially now a a subsidiary, doctrinally distinct, but but the tributary uh faith within that greater tradition. Like, it's like episcop, you got your uh presbiterians, your methodis, your baptists, your pentecostals, your catholics. and that's all like on the same level of distinction, and a lot of this didn't just come from those puritan fucks, those calvinist fucks, it really came in terms of stiff like creating the uh like the cultural backbone, like creating the uh the the the social lived experience of this religious tradition, fucking scotch irish, holy shit, those motherfuckers. and if you want to know the difference between like scandinavian uh christianity and uh american I think the fact that they didn't have any scotch irish might be a big part of it, the fucking ulster prots man, some of theoh, and there that's why olster protestantism is one of the very few European uh religious and political traditions that is similar in like even specifics to American, like they also have like creationists and they also fight the same culture war, and if you go to the uh the protestant neighborhoods in Belfast. and see the fucking murals, they are, they embrace this connection, i've seen one of stonewall jackson, there's one with James Bucannon and it says Scotch Irish president, like yeah the worst one we had, congratulations you fucking assholes, I saw I famously saw, I i remember seeing a picture of a of a wall of a like a UDF clubhouse, and it had a bunch of flags on the wall, and it had the red hand of Olster, it had a south African apartied flag, um, the Rodesian. Apartide flag and the confederate flag and they're also like global warming deniers and you know what fanatically anti abortion in a way that like the way that reactionaries just aren't in mainland Europe how long we gone now I gotta what time is it anybody I I only I don't have my... laptop out here, does anyone have the time? not the length of the stream, but the am pm type situation. 6:37. all right, great. all right, i'm going to wind down pretty soon because i think, no, wait a minute, no, i got like 10 minutes left, i think. all right, or longer, i have 15 minutes, 15 minutes. what's scienttology's relationship to American? It's essentially the the uh the the sciencized, it's the grad student version, it's American Christianity where the uh where the experience of like of living in the technological innovative moment and else also this the uh the spiritually destroying moment of world war ii, the atom bomb in the holocaust, you cannot accept God as a supernatural conception, the way that christians can it in those services, in that uh, in that instance if you have a certain frame of mind, if maybe you have a certain education, if you approach things from a more empirical, a more grounded, a more secular uh uh perspective, and that's going to be a product of your upbringing, your brain chemistry, all these things out of your control, and if you end up on that end of the spectrum, one answer to you know what, what is the good now in this in this mad house that is that shows god that that humanity has almost limitless power to do evil, but what about good? and it is a it is a science based, the science replacing god, but having the same purpose, the idea of giving people a ability to write themselves across the world and into outer space and see God's zenus. whatever will reflected in the success or failure of the venture? do I think Jordan Peterson's daughter is trying to kill him, I don't want to get sued for making claims without basis, but I will just say this, she certainly doesn't seem to be treating him with a lot of care, and I'm sorry, it might be a cheap shot, but you do have to wonder how much of that is his responsibility as a father. I'll just say that, but it does look like his shit sucks and I, I kind of feel bad for him. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm wrong, maybe putting him in a medical coma at. like a in a Serbian ex like Bosnian labor camp during the middle of a fucking pandemic after feeding him game meets for five years might not might is that's all in his best interest yeah and now she's uh she's with the with the sex trafficker allegedly yeah Good, good work, good work there, Jordan really knocked it out of the park there. I am not on the all beef diet, no, I'm trying to reduce my beef intake actually, I'm debefening, making, like I said, I'm making beyond burgers with Kimchie and my beloved goju jaangshas. but I do think I might want to try to, I still want to try to do a brisket on my birthday though, or before my birthday, brisket for my birthday, birthday brisket, oh one other thing about Trump saying, it'll get colder, you watch, is it that is, that is... his essential con artist nature, i mean cuuse his entire career has been like him pursuing well, him pursuing fame, yeah, it didn't mean that he was good at business, and he's in a lot of ways was very bad at business, but it didn't matter because of how good he was at fame, he kept getting bailed out because his name was too valuable, so in a real sense he was a good businessman, because he never lost any money, it was always the dumb ass investors who had to take a haircut to keep his name valid and to make keep him a brand and more importantly to keep him a fucking cover for a bunch of money laundering, which of course is a huge part of his entire fucking thing, i mean for at least last 10 years before he ran for president, his entire real estate uh uh, his entire real estate uh empire was just pure ass, dead ass, motherfucking no caparino uh uh money laundering for like russian mob guys uh and but that's all because he was famous so he's he he was so good at being famous it made him good at business you all say hi to the people uh are you on the stream yeah you want to say hi not particularly okay i'm going to rine up in a second here uh brendon james folks brendon james he's going to grow with me today he doesn't want to talk to you pigs though and i don't blame them because you keep giving me the business about my damn microphone i always listening to his music listen to the music brendon do they talk to you yeah i see them talking, but uh, it's just the their writing, it goes very fast, you are reaching Jim Jones level uh set up here, come on, my babies, you're in a come on my babies, now outfit talking to a little screen, yeah in your like, in my layer, in my compound layer, no, I'm feeling jonesing, I'm joinesing, come to me my babies, mother, mother, mother, mother, please, I started these street doing uh Jim Jones shit and now I'm back, okay, I I'm being unoriginal then, but I couldn't help, no, no, no, you haven't seen any of the streams, so you don't know how that's the exact right thing to think immediately, that is what I see, uh, fuck, I was think, what was I going to, shit, I was going to finish this thing about Trump, uh, money laundering for Russian, yeah, that he's just he's famous, but he's good at business because he's good at being famous, oh right, but his actual business dealings were just kicking the can down the road until somebody bailed him out and scamming people into giving him more money and bridge loans and shit and so it would always be, just you watch, it'll be worked out, he goes to, he goes to Atlantic City, hey uh, what about junk bonds? no, you watch, we're not going to use any junk bonds and then nothing but junk bonds and so he can say, he's hey, what does it matter to him, he's only president for another four years, he can say, it'll get cooler, you watch, and if it doesn't, what difference does it make, he got out of that moment, that's all it meant to do, all right guys, this is a good one today, bye-bye.
