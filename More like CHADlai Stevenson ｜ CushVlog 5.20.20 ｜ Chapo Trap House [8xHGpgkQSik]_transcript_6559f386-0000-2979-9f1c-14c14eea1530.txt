 Ah, there we go, that took a minute, took a minute, but it worked, now we're here, we're here, hello, hello, how you guys doing, ah, chatting it up, chatting it up. two days, probably not going to do tomorrow, so uh, wanted to get one in here, uh, beautiful day in the city, feeling good, uh, my grill isn't here yet, but when I get it, I'm going to go to town, and as I said, I hope you guys are the first to find out, you guys will be the first to see the uh, the setup. which will be very, very elementary, don't roast me, i'm i'm a virgin griller, i don't need a bunch of smart alic remarks uh and also uh maybe show you how how i do it, how i cook it up, we'll see, not yet though, right now i'm in here, i'm in here looking out the window, trying not to get my neighborhood mad at me again, although now it would be more than just him because uh it's it's grilling season so i got neighbor is very close on every side and uh someone's going to call the cops if i start if i keep hollering out there so i'll try to holler in here, keep hollering about the anubus right here for you people and not get me in trouble with uh the a police or anything i definitely know need a couple of freaking statin island nypd psychopaths to show up and put me in a chill cold no thank you hell yes the snider cut will be released and i got to say I mean it is absolutely a symbol of create of bankrupcy and it's a symbol of just the lack, I mean they're doing this because one, they're out of ideas and two, they literally can't make other movies right now, this is just a way to to take something that they have and had no use for and now can actually get some money from, I mean they're planning the silver air, it is really a sign that that uh the economy is specifically the entertainment economy is in a crisis that it might not recover from and if it it does it won't look the same uh but at the same time god i want to see it if it's really three and a half hours three and a half hours of superhero movies by a guy who hates superheroes specifically superman god it'll be great it'll be fun i can't wait 2021 hope we make it guys hope we make it fam hope we make it so that we can all be in our third quarantine and watch the fucking snider cut. uh, I started watching the the plinket review, but the thing is I didn't watch the show and I don't care about star trek so it's like I can't actually get into this, I still like those guys obviously and I like their star trek stuff, star wars stuff, but I never checky. honestly podcast might be might be one of the few things to survive uh, i mean not necessarily the ad supported ones, but just because of the overhead compared to other entertainment products uh it could be viable in a way that uh that a lot of these other ones might not be. Yeah, that's the other thing is the podcasting can be done in quarantine, I mean they can't shoot movies right now if they wanted to, they wanted to make more money off their investments like the the sunk costs of all the debt service for for all the maintenance of the physical plant, they can't do it, anybody can still be recording podcasts, everyone, of course that means you could get a real cuuse we thought we hit podcasts, but that was before this, now podcasting you know becomes one of the... only viable uh entertainment sectors that can reliably produce new material, people say animated movies sure, but those turn the turn arounds much much slower and of course barrier for entry is much higher, so we might finally get to the Andy Warhall, everyone has a fucking podcast that spends 15 minutes on the itunes top 100. I don't hate Chris Hedges, I just think that he is. is uh, he's exactly the kind of guy you don't want on your side in any kind of argument, because he embodies all of the most uh off-putting uh elements of of left uh political culture, the the stiff-neck puritanism of uh of uh like the congregationalist reformers of the 19th century and like those people had were allies, but they should not be uh shaping uh arguments on behalf of the left because they're not really pitching towards those people, by which I mean regular people. How do I feel about Destiny, the streamer? How, why would you ask me that? Come on, people, what do I think of Eastwood's Richard Jeel? I've said this before, so I won't say too much more, but I think it's fantastic, I think it's amazing, I feel like for all of the missteps and sort of half-ass shit that he has done in the last 20 years when he's just been banging him out. not really caring too much, he maybe accidentally he fucking hit a goddamn home run, just not even trying to, i don't even know, but or maybe he was, maybe he was trying to get it something with other projects that he couldn't quite put into words and this is finally the right combination of of like true story, uh, point of view character, stakes to actually stick it, because eastwood's movies and you can look back and even the real bad ones like American Sniper which is a terrible movie, has awful politics, but in addition to that is a shitty film, it is a bad even as an action movie, the action scenes are dog shit, because Eastwood is a is a uh corner cutting motherfucker, of course there's CGI instead of real squibs, of course first shot of the movie is him blowing somebody away from long distance, and of course it's squib, it's a fucking CGI city, even as an action film it fails, but he's... has been trying to say something about the crisis of American masculinity, which of course people have been trying to articulate for decades now uh, and I think he got, he's been trying to get at an essential quality of it, an essential conflict at the heart of like trying to be a guy in America, uh, when the when you're in a transititional state away from valuing the the the sort of male attributes that built the society and the social structure that you were uh brought into, but now the material conditions are changing, but of course changing ahead of the change in the culture and that creates this space of vertigo and this this uncertainty and how do we fill it? and very few movies talk about that, i mean they're too anxious about the subject, they're just going to primly like toxic masculinity or if they're you know just shitheaded and they're just going to going to reactionally uh just wallow in toxicity for its own sake without even reflecting on it, i feel like eastwood has actually not, he's not trying to trigger the libs, as funny as as much as they pitch that movie is triggering and as much honestly as the log line makes it look like it's supposed to trigger the libs, innocent man who's just trying to save the day is harassed by the fake news media academia and uh the FBI just like a certain someone i know the actual movie itself is not like that, the actual movie itself is an incredibly perceptive and nuanced examination of how class and her sex with masculine. uh and whiteness of course also really good and i want to do a i want to do a uh i want to do an episode with me and will where we just talk talk about it it's on streaming now so i think soon we're going to we're going to watch it i don't know we might do a commentary track but honestly i think we might just do a regular episode it'll be one of the rare ones where we're talking about a movie that's actually un un uh i'm ironically really really good and not something where you're trying to pick the the shit out you know pick the oats out of the shit like this is a real gem a cut gem as it were since east what is a go as hell or wait a minute no that's the wrong way i've showered shut up i didn't see dragged across concrete cuz i i knew like his his his last two movies i was like a week after they left theaters we're on streaming on amazon so i just thought i'd wait and then it and then fucking grad across concrete went to uh cinemax which i don't have and now i'm honestly just it's spite i will not pay money to see it so i'm just going to have to wait for it to eventually because i know that the minute i fucking rent it it'll be somewhere that i could stream for free and nobody say torrent i don't know how to do that one honestly one time i tried to torrent something and my computer nearly fucking had smoke coming out of it i do not know how to do that. I see that uh, I see that wall is on, yeah, but still that's a hel, I honestly would not want to talk to Jacob just because I don't want to pierce the... veil, he's doing something that's operating at such a higher level than most other people in in comedy and it's certainly in political comedy, i mean most importantly like when you consider the the wasteland that is political comedy in this country, the the absolute just nator, the shit level of quality uh, i mean my god quality, comedy is so bad under Trump that people think we're funny, our show is funny, because compared to everything else it actually kind of is and I think that more just speaks to the the absolute pausity of the of the genre in this age of Trump, the inability of anybody to figure an angle that is actually funny for it, uh, so with that the case with. with comedy so dog shit in politics, wall is the king, wall is the is absolutely uh killing it, because I don't, and I can't even, I mean Andy Couchman is the comparison, but honestly it's I think it even level beyond Andy Couchman, because I feel like Jacob has truly gotten to the point where he doesn't care what anyone thinks of him, where he is in turn, like his his performance is either a subconscious or a conscious. uh performance of total submission to the uh to the psychology of online, to the psychology of fame in the air of the internet, the idea that there is no distinguishing figure, there is no distinguishing characteristic between good and bad fame, good and bad notoriety, good and bad press, any of that, that all that being a thing is all that matters, being a media thing is the only thing that defines your life, it is what separates you from the people who increasingly are seeing their lives not only determined by you know uh spiritual enemy that comes from working uh jobs that they don't love compromise most people fight club era but now actually have the wolf at their door materially more and more we're going to see it and then one thing that is almost a sure guide ramp away from that is fucking fame you can squeeze some juice out of almost any fucking lemon if you've got a little bit of fucking fame, if you've got a little bit of notoriety, you can prime the pump, and i mean even if that means like, i mean that's going all the way through every level of the economy from you know tom cruise to a fucking uh to podcasters uh to to twitch streamers to people with only fans and and and chatterbait notoriety is the only surefire or mostly sure fire escape hatch from just the banality and and and uh and uh immiseration of modern life and so the best way to secure that is to not care what the attention is, like bowl truly doesn't care what people think of him in a way that no no internet prankster, no Andy Koffman could ever say, like every fucking blackpill teenager who like makes fun of cringe would die if someone that they respected another another blackpilled person thought that they weren't twisted that they weren't epically fucking twisted same thing with all the outright people you don't want people to think that you're a cuck and of course obviously it's on the left it's incredibly important like no matter what your performance is towards somebody not your hostility or anything there is some things you won't say and some things you won't do because you want someone somewhere to think uh that you're doing a good. job, you don't want everyone to think you're an asshole. Jacob's stick is in ensures that everyone will think that he's an idiot, because right-wingers don't, i mean, come on, like his stuff is is embarrassing, no one takes it seriously, it undermines the right wing, but he's also too absurd for anybody and he's too good at keeping a poker face for anyone to to to dare suggest that he might be in on it. to the degree that he shouldn't be shuned uh and then just like as an operator he looks like a clown because none of his ops work, they all blow up in his face, it's pure entertainment value, he's doing it purely to entertain, and that entertainment doesn't have to be connected to any feeling about him, and that is pure, all other entertainment, there is a ego, there's an ego hitching a ride that wants to be seen a certain way by certain people, it might be a very small group, fuck everyone else, but there's someone I want to impress, someone I want to recognize what I'm trying to do, who catches the wink, even if it's a very slight wink, they catch the wink. wall unlike everyone and i'm like i'm saying sam hide the fucking uh uh cowman to everybody he does not blank and so the i i just thought i wouldn't want to talk to him how am i gonna how can i possibly uh engage with him i don't want to assume anything about what he really believes and what he really thinks and i certainly can't credit anything he would tell me is meaning anything i mean is he just totally vapid is he a pure product of his environment because his dad is a fucking oath, his dad is a psycho right-wing uh media huckster from california uh an ambulance chaser too, i think uh, so born into this life, i mean maybe he is just that transparent and that stunted that he's just totally had that worldview impressed upon him to the point that it's translucent even to himself, that would be fascinating, but i wouldn't know from his answers if that were the case or if he's on a 50- level irony regression that no... could possibly follow, it's i just don't want to, i don't want to tempt fate, i feel like indiana jones, when they open the arc of the covent, close your fucking eyes, but if anybody else wants to interview him, i'll probably listen to that yab, but still, i'm just curious, apparently brand wardell wanted him to name five hot babes, that's kind of funny, i wonder what he said, oh jack burkman is amazing, where the fuck did he get that? guy the fucking the turtleneck uh the turtleneck sport jacket combination that it it suggests the as Felix said that turtleneck suggests the um neck brace that you know he's usually wearing to small claims court fly down at the muller one the first big one fly down putting the thing on the MS oh my god I mean he looks like a 90 softcore porn actor. he looks like he was in a movie with fucking Shan and tweed, like uh, yeah, uh, hushed encounters or something, tampa nights, I did not read the Tracy Nagel piece, I saw exerts, uh, if anyone has, I mean, he's blocked, but Brace Belden has an account where he he went through it, and I agree with him. uh, it's just hard not to see it all as the as as part of the score settling because you know you had you had the rad libs and you had the and you had the class reductionists and they were all like eying each other across the the across the thorofair during that whole Bernie campaign they were keeping their powder dry and now Bernie's gone boom the guns are back out and it's back to the exact same arguments which is what kind of made me have my moment of realizing oh my god we're right back where we started like when that whole should people do blurs in DSA thing, it's like, how do you not get a just soul drenching horror of Dajavu, knowing that this is the exact same fucking argument, with and no one has progressed, all the Bernie campaign did was just give everybody something else to talk about for a while, now if he'd won, I think over time, some of that friction would have resolved itself just through actual engagement with the world, like oh, Bernie's in charge now. we actually have a project and I think some people would splint off and be like, no, fuck this, I need to maintain my my sanctity, but I think a lot of people a lot of the more good faith people who are there and have to be reckoned with, and and are ignored by both sides, would have come together, but sadly it was, it was abortive, and now a lot of it's just throwing back up the barricades, it's very disappointing to see, I will say that uh, it's very funny that Michael Tracy is writing this article. about how Bernie you know wasn't he didn't have an americanist enough uh uh socialism like his his his populism was not flavored with America because it was too adulterated with the ideas of these radical identitarians online who he has to please there was a candidate who had the campaign that Michael Tracy wanted and he recognized that and he supported her and doggedly followed around the place her name was fucking Tusie Gabbard I've seen i was at the Iowa court. fuck and i saw telver give her stump speech, i nearly passed out, she does exactly what he talked about, flag apple pie, blah blah blah uh uh that rad lib virgil asked her if she was an anti-imperialist and she said i'm pro-american and of course jade at brooklights roll their eyes at that, but that's exactly the kind of answer that Michael Chasey would want to a question like that, and it got her nowhere and more importantly than it didn't get her nowhere with the with the with the voters, it got her nowhere with the press and the party either, she was still... persona nongrata, she was still the craziest sad apologist, she was still someone who no respectable person could engage with, so that implies that if Bernie was as indigestible by the party as we all now know he had to have been for what they did, he was that indigestible, then his gestures towards fucking uh uh uh patriotic piety would have fucking been rejected, and the idea that there is some mass of people who aren't paying attention to the media to have that shaped, yeah, they weren't paying attention then, they stayed not paying attention, they continue to not pay attention, because they are broken off from the political system, that's what we discovered during this campaign, bernie fuck. up a lot of things, but that was the fundamental juncture where it was fucked up and no amount of messaging at any level of the campaign strategy was going to change that, you needed to change the conveyor bult of ideology to action operating in huge chunks of the working class in this country, and the fucking sanders campaign was supposed to help jump start the movement, but it then was supposed to kick in to create a virtuous cycle, and the kicking in never happened, and that was and that was because if you're... paying attention, you sure shit don't notice that Bernie Sanders has a flag pin on, you sure shit don't care that he said that he wanted to abolish ice, you don't ev, you are not registering these things at the level of political engagement, so they are essentially useless to you, they're information, it's like fucking deep space readings from a fucking seti uh tell antenna array or something, just a bunch of beeps and boops on on a screen, you don't know what they mean, because you're not connected to it. It's uh, it's idealism is what it is, guys, it's pure fantasy, because like I've said, this argument is at the level of ideology, and it does not engage with material at all, because it's all done online, and so that means that all these ideas are purely generated by this fixation on a web conversation that is not being had by the vast majority of people in this country, and that there is no not enough connective tissue. between whatever the interests might be represented by the hive mind of twitter or something, actually impressing themselves on the part on on the political process, more than things that are rooted in, i don't know, material interest and fucking money, like the entire media, like the entire to both parties, it's just like the the the task was monumental, and the and anyone that wants to talk about the campaign strategy at any level being the foundational reason because obviously things were exacerbated by bad decisions in different areas and we can talk about that and I think Tracy and uh Negel pointed to one good one which was um yet they clearly fucked up South Carolina just through the campaigning I don't know anything specifically but the results speak for themselves and that there was clearly some something whatever they were doing wasn't working and they didn't recognize that in time and that Bernie should have been campaigning the whole time he should not have waited. until 2000 uh, what 2000, 2018, i think, like the end of 2018, uh, he should have been sort of the de facto candidate the whole time, now that would have still been hard, because the media has to kind of go along with you on that, like by giving you attention, and they would not have done so, so once again a lot of these end up catching on the question of, well where does, where do you break these these path dependent cycles between the voters and the media and engage people who aren't essentially conditioned along certain ways so but I'm saying those things might have exacerbated it and like I said if and like we always thought the hope was keep the anti-burny people from. until it's too late and that could have worked even with the media against him with a few things with things going differently with a smaller biden victory in South Carolina for one not winning South Carolina that looks like that would never have happened but if they cut that margin down that could have helped that could have changed the the contours of the race uh and then but then once corona hits you really can't be predicting anything anymore cuz like I think Berty still had a chance after Super Tuesday in the conditions. a regular campaign where there are about roughly equal number of delegates, you don't have the economy collapsing and the giant viral attack and Biden has to campaign regularly, he has to go outside, he has to meet voters, he has to shake hands, he has to give speaches every day, like this, the fact that they had were left with the desperate move of going with Biden by Bernie, that shows that Burning was a threat, and it also left them vulnerable in a longer run, but of course we never. got that for reasons that I don't think anyone could point to as being politically based and certainly not based on fucking Twitter conversations about abolishing ice. legacy of asses uh has some fun stuff in it uh and there's plenty of stories true stories of CIA goofaps but but it's got it feels like a limited hangout because it's one of those books where it's main put uh argument is that the CIA is too bad at its job to really be a threat that that all of their worst crimes are crimes of incompetence that they then tried to cover up and that's not really true, I mean there were there are a lot of genuine bungles, I mean the way that they got like 500 eastern Europeans contract agents killed because they kept... dropping them into uh behind the iron curtain while kimby was in the room knowing exactly where every one of them went and that did they never noticed for fucking years that every single guy they sent over there got that was a genuine bungle ba pigs another real bungle but that book doesn't have anything about for example uh you know the successful shit uh and it doesn't really talk as much about and it doesn't really talk about mk ultra to any serious extent or the chaos operation that went along with - intelpro uh or Gladio and shit like that, which I know is a NATO operation, but the CIA helped set all those organizations up, all that post war project paperclip stuff, it all it all gets kind of uh soft soped, but there's still good information in it, oh man that CIA tweet, fuck a day, air America, the motherfuckers, like the biggest, most successful drug smuggling operation of the last 40 years was carried out by not fucking Pablo askim. or el chapo or anybody, it was the fucking central intelligence agency from from Vietnam war, creating a heroin network out of nowhere, there was opium in southeast Asia, but there was no industrial heroin production until the CIA showed up in the early 60s and turn the golden triangle into the world's headquarters for fucking heroin, which they shipped around on air America, then uh after the Bowen amendment and they were uh cut off funding to the contras they fucking sold crack to their own citizens for, i mean they sold the heroin to their own servicemen uh, because tons by the end of the war like a third of the fucking troops in vietnam were on smack and it was all provided by the CIA, uh, like Milo Minder-binder shit, and then they sold crack to their own citizens uh, through Iran contra, and and then after Afghanistan was invaded, uh, and they went from almost eradicating the poppy. of uh crops to becoming now the world fucking headquarters for heroin production or uh and for opium and these motherfuck and of course as I said uh southern air transport which uh was the technical name for air America bought by less wexner in the 90s used by l brands to ship clothing across the world jesus fucking christ and they're just they're dabbing on it. fucking CIA's jabing on us, like the FBI and their Martin Luther Kingday thing, this is like the fucking snowman, the Mr. Mr. conspiracy theory, I gave you all the clues, I guess we're just like, you know what, fuck it, fuck it, masks entirely off, I think we're definitely in the mask off decade. Cool zone decades, mask off, whatever you want to call them. Favorite Chris Elliot uh I really love uh I love uh get a life one of my favorite shows seminal comedy influences a child but the actual show itself you know you remember as a kid there's the bits speewy is the top to bottom masterpiece one of the greatest episodes of uh sitcom television ever eagle heart's very good too but god damn it cabin boy is such a beautiful little gym 90 minutes. Hm, my favorite. ice cream is the stratia chelli gelato, a fancy boy, fancy treat tastes, it is not Jenny's, that is some fucking pizza gate ice cream, no thank you, someone saw tremmers and says it's perfect, thank you, correct it is. Oh man, I don't know, by July 4th, I somebody asked about this, the the mega protest of the 4th of July, I think everything's going to be out and about by July 4th, and honestly I'm kind of getting to the point where I think the people who are, I mean obviously not the protesters, those people are buffoons, but people who are starting to go out, I think that they honestly, as much as people are yelling at them and thinking of them as either selfish, which yes, very selfish, but stupid and ignorant, uh, I kind of think that they have a better grasp of the real dynamics of play here than people who are still sitting at home and making sure that they don't even go to their friends houses or something, because they i mean they might not recognize this, but as i have said there is not going to be any cavalry coming, there's not going to be any fixing. this uh in a way that allows us to stay inside indefinitely, people are going to have to go back out, and as I have said, uh, that that's going to be the attempt to like boost the economy back up, and that's why when Trump was saying that thing about how testing is bad, given that mindset, it's not stupid to think that because that's going to undermine uh consumer confidence. now somebody else said after that uh they said, yeah, but it's not going to work, people aren't going to come out and the economy is still going to be dog shit, um, and so it's still stupid, well yeah, that is going to happen, but the thing is, the people in charge of us, they are not going to deviate from the chorester on, this disastrous mutual ruination where you ignore the science, and you uh, you you allow the the disease to run its riot, run riot and try to recreate the retail economy, that is, those are incompatible things, because people are going to get too sick to work. and people aren't going to want to go outside, they're not going to want to go to the place because it's still dangerous out, so that means that it won't work, but they're not going to do anything to change this course until they see that it doesn't work, and i'm not saying that in terms like being an accelerationist, i'm saying realistically, given the people in charge, given the constraints, given their uh their rewards and given their knowledge and their values and ideology, every vector, they will always think well, we could open things back up again and it'll get normal, it will open things, they don't have anything else in the toolbox, so they assume this will work, they have to see it not work, and when i say not work, i mean now we have to do something else because the economy is still collapsed, and people are now sicker than ever, something else has to be done, they will not get to that point until they see it fail, so if that's the case, why the hell don't we get it over with? see somebody says it's it's going to kill who wants to kill and nobody's going to bad an eye, yes, but people are still going to stay indoors to avoid getting killed, they're not going to bat an eye, they're not going to get too mad the government for letting this happen, they're not going to have a revolution, but they're also not going to go to the store as much, they're not going to go to the bar as much, they're not going to go to the... they're not going to spend, they're not going to do this spending that has to fill the giant void that got created by demand, basically drying up for th months, that reality is going to persist and it's going to have to be dealt with, not in the sense of, well shouldn't someone deal with this, in the sense of the thing isn't going to work anymore, like the lights aren't going to go on, now i'm not saying it's going to get to that point, but i'm going to say that has to be on the table, possibility to get anything to change, to get anything to change, now what that change is, yeah, we could be talking about some nightmare, like uh, where we, i've talked about this in the past, where we hyper police, people who are suspected or infected and let everybody else out, but honestly the thing that could prevent that is just "there's a reason we haven't been able to get together any kind of testing and tracing mechanism, even though that would be obviously good for the economy, like in the interest of capital, getting trusting and tracing." together would be in the un like not in any cont, there's no conflict there, there's no like a post uh you know um 48 revolution in France uh bourgeois conflict everybody in in charge of everything wants testing and tracing because it would allow commerce and yet we don't have any, that means that somewhere along the line there are too many hands out, there's too much outsource machinery and infrastructure, there's there's it's too. red bear of a of a uh of an of a um of an infrastructure that it can't be done that we can't do it, like you say South Korea did it, yes, but South Korea has institutions that could be that can be uh built up and scaled up to handle this. There is nothing that can be scaled anywhere because everything's been auctioned off, you would have to go stitch it back together. wait, what happened to the euro zone? did they get rid of the euro zone today? i mean that was inevitable, it's been inevitable since 08 honestly, it was just going to need one more push for the cook machine to fall over. i mean it was inevitable as soon as they created the EU was doomed uh as soon as a if as soon as a big enough crisis hit it before its political uh union had like solidified behind it and so since that happened that basically that was the beginning of the end there that was when the tumor was first uh metastasized so what happened? what what happened in the EU? the euro zone fund got bailed out, oh more austerity for southern Europe, that's great. uh, shit, does that mean Italy is gonna go to leave? yeah, no, the idea that there's just they're going to fucking make them borrow the money to avoid their society collapsing, goddamn fucking germans man. just replace the panzer with a fucking fountain pen and now a goddamn gigabyte, am i right folks? crazy world, they how to sell tickets. Well somebody says no one's going to leave the EU because the EU serves the interest of capital, that's true, but there is a political legitimacy crisis in Europe just there is there is us and there are centrifical forces operating on the EU just as they are the United States and they're more intense in the EU because EU identity is much more fragile so there is going to be a conflict between uh like national level uh governing class and the ruling the ruling you know capital accumulation in Europe and that's that's going to play itself out politically and maybe militarily who knows and that's that same pressure is happening in the US uh the US it will take more for the US to have the same fractures but i think those pressures exist and acting like that they can't go anywhere i think you're all anyone says any of that like... nothing will happen, you are assuming that we recover with a speed uh and uh and smoothness that I just don't know is not, I mean I'm not saying it's definitely not going to happen, but I'm saying 50/50, I have decided as a way to like clear my head of all these questions of what's going to happen that I'm going to follow the chuck costerman rule, which is that everything is a 50/50 proposition. either can happen or it can't, that's it, it's binary, so therefore there's a 50/50 chance of anything happening, and I know that's glib, and it's it's kind of just jackassery, but uh, I think it's a good way just for your own mental health to deal with the questions of the future, both big and small, from who's going to win the presidential election to you, will the United States exist in 10 years, and the thing is is that when those things happen, they will look very clear, like, oh, obviously this was yes, but from this vantage point, it's a fucking 50/50, do you do any kind of meditation at all? yes, ever since my moment in my garden, I have been... committing to daily uh, daily sittings, I had a really good one today, uh, I'm really, I'm really, I've been groping around with it, trying to see what works for me, but I found, I found some really uh, today was really great, I'll just say that, I feel, I feel centered, so I recommend it to anybody who uh, who feels like their don't have their their lives are a little too uh, they get it, just it's they're finding it hard to find themselves in a present, you know, like too reactive or too uh, too wool gathering, you know, being in a moment, that's a good way to be in a moment, kind of train yourself over time to be more in a moment, i hate the mindfulness is awful shit, because it's been like everything else colonized and turned into neoliberal uh mind warfare, but that's true of everything, including marxism to an extent. but it's still a good advice, the problem is is that it just it doesn't, you don't know what it means, because it's just a word, you have to actually like build up an understanding of it over time, that's why it's hard to communicate this kind of stuff to somebody you don't know, oh man was. and supper clubs o grand tradition very uh the uh leftover from prohibition uh they were these they were prohibition or speakies that sort of evolved into restaurants uh there waday was post war air of course like it was in everything in America and there are these seedy uh well they weren't seed but they were they're very dark very dark filled with cigarette smoke uh huge curved uh dark leather banquets, almost no direct lighting, very, very dark, and everything is just a giant overpriced hunk of meat uh, and of course a fish fry on Friday. Whoa, people are bellowing tonight, is it a full moon? people are getting buck, I don't go outside anymore, I said earlier, I don't want my neighbors to get mad at me, I get too exciteble sometimes, I've been more chilled out lately, but problem is I can't really modulate myself, oh right, it's 7 o'clock, that's why everyone's going crazy, I totally forgot, oh jeez, no man, fish fry is uh, that is that is the inland, that's third coast shit, that's the that's the catholic uh, the catholic midwestern heartland, Friday. fry baby, have i had crawfish? oh god, yeah, they're not really worth the work, honestly, but i remember one time i was in New Orleans and i had a giant huge, just cartoonishly heaping pile of catfish, or i mean of crayfish, and uh, just work through them, my fingers just got like bright red, it was fun uh, you know what, I'm not honoring the boaters cuuse fuck the boats. That's right, I said it, I am fucking letting down the beautiful boners, you know why, because the beautiful boners let us down. If you guys know anything about that horrific fucking uh damn rupture in Michigan that's going to maybe I don't know, poison half the state because of fucking giant d chemical plants about to get fucking flooded, is a private dam where this asshole owned, he refused. to do repairs on it that were required uh or i guess suggested i guess the rules don't apply anymore at all uh just i don't understand it at no point was he just like coersed by the state into fucking maintaining this thing anyway uh and he wouldn't pay for it because a bunch of fucking disgusting boat shit heads who live on the lake and benefit from this artificial lake that was created for uh recreation uh that they that they pay for it and they say no you're making money off it you for it like all of you pigs should be paying for this and instead they fucking flooded a goddamn town going to give everybody fucking legionares disease and goddamn uh microcephaliy and is an exact historical echo of the Johnstown flood in late in Robert Baronerra Pennsylvania, it was a private fuck uh John there was a dam near Johnstown uh Pennsylvania that was used to create an artificial lake for the fucking carnegies and their asshole friends to dick around in in the fucking straw boaters on on fucking pontoon boats playing banjos or whatever the fuck else and they just let it go to shit. none of them would pay to repair it and the motherfucking thing uh exploded and killed the entire town and nobody got in trouble at all. it's good to know that we've progressed. so yeah, but those boters are too just disgustingly pig-selfish to conceive of any version of a public good and they can all fuck off. i used to fucking respect the voters and now i don't know anymore. i don't know if i can respect these boters if they don't have any kind of civic understanding. It's sad too because boats are cool, but the kind of things that need to go in your go on in your life to make you get a boat in this country basically disqualify you from common humanity. Yeah, if it was Dunkirk, none of those beautiful boaters would cross the channel to save their troops, they would watch TV and they would complain that nobody else is doing it, not one of them. think to go fucking hitch up their own fucking boat and ride into the the the straping fire of the looft wafa, fuck them. somebody wants to know about declining birth rates, I mean that's a consequence of uh of of of ease of life of of of comfort of soft that whole that dumb meme about the hard times making soft people or whatever the fuck soft by the way things it's a it's a byproduct of uh of alien of of of material alienation giving way to uh to spiritual alienation cuuse like there's a there's a sweet spot where people want to have a couple of kids uh and uh that keeps you know birth rates going uh but you get to a point and you're either too comfortable to really even conceive of a future and you're totally focused on your personal pleasure so why would you need other people around in the future or uh what happens in countries like the US as opposed to more you know advanced countries with with higher standards of living um uh is that everybody fucking is so terrified of losing their middle class status that they can't have a kid, but if you don't have anywhere of that fear of falling, you'll have many more kids, in fact you have to have kids, uh, and it's all it's it's you it's about finding a sweep spot of like assimilation and technology and and uh, and i mean, it's not going to be a problem anybody's going to have in the future, i don't think, uh, unless of course plastics have really done the number, which is of course the scarier idea, which is that it's not just you know a social phenomenon or not just not only a social phenomenon, uh, it's the result of the fucking plastic that we are all ingesting every second of our lives even before we're born and it get like gets into our fucking uh uh our our endocrine system and very well could be just decimating sperm counts and shit like that and making it making us all literally uh literally infertile, like we could be going into a children of men territory, children of men, one of my favorite movies, um, but it looks like we might beat that to the punch, like right now it looks. like yeah yeah yeah birth rate a plastic thing we get that but we're probably going to um do something else some something involving climate change and probably this virus this virus looks like something interesting we could probably work with that uh but yeah no it's good to have the hip pocket you know down the road if we make it through this good to know that we've got the impending mass sterilization caused by uh by uh omnipresence of fucking petroleum products fucking petroleum products the goddamn dinosaurs. the fucking dinosaurs extincted us, can you believe it? the goddamn dinosaur is extincted our asses, those dumb fuckers with the little arms, they extincted us without even trying, can you believe it, those fuckers and we make so much fun of them for just being like, those morons had no idea big rock was going to come and kill them, it's like yeah they couldn't have, they were fucking you know, they were uh animals, you are an advanced. species, you know what you're doing, and you keep doing it anyway, you are much stupider than dinosaurs, and they killed your ass without even being alive. apparently uh, dinosaurs are natural gas, not oil, but guess what, we're also using that shit. my favorite dinosaur uh as a kid was probably the triceratops buse the at the um the Milwaaki public museum which you'd go to when you were a kid in Wisconsin Milwaake was the like the the field trip location w not for I for me anyway we went to the Milwaake uh history the Milwack museum public museum and they have a big thing is like a dark chamber and in the chamber there's this plastic uh t-rex and he's eating the - tiraceratops that's on its side uh and it's got like the guts in his mouth and i don't know why but i guess i uh i i uh identified with the triceratops which probably isn't great but what do you do branosaurus is not a real dinosaur I'm glad somebody enjoys the triceratops. What do I think of the parallel universe discovered by NASA uh I'm just sitting over here went like yeah no no uh certainly nothing. that uh I did not I not anticipate, it's all coming together, all systems are are coming into focus, but yes uh parallel dimensions, parallel realities, those exist, there's no question about that, it's just the only question is whether they're accessible, this indicates that they're accessible, which is if we can actually access that then we're living in Rick and Morty world, and that would be uh pretty epic, I think we can all agree. if we got the rick and boardy time uh portal world or the dimensional portal world, we get some dimensional cable up in here, i'd appreciate that, uh, i'm sure it's not true because i don't anything about science, but i'm going to choose to believe it's true because it helps reify a world view and in a uh attitude that i think is beneficial for me in the long term, so i am just going to choose to believe that that's true and that they've discovered parallel dimensions and that one day i will get to go to the America. where uh they never fucking canceled uh fucking firefly and there's 15 seasons of firefly for me to watch, oh that'd be so great, just zip over there, get the mind discs and of course a mind disc player, don't want to just have one without the other zip over and watch them all day. Thank you, I am having a pretty good day, I'm feeling good, oh man, if we got to live in sliders, that would really redeem a lot of the shitty stuff, it's like, yes, yes, I'm sorry, everything suck, but you got to go in all these different universus, check out the version of you that have that actually knew how to dump it, that could here. is the version of you that could dunk a basketball? leave it, get to check out that guy's life for a while, how awesome would that be? Rick and Maddy, oh I wish, I would love to be with a scientist of that renown and ability, come on. what is the ideal slider burger? ah, you know what, i've had a fancy ones, i've had ones on little plates at at elegant openings and uh events, i've had them at uh reclaimed wood, fancy gastropubs with uh beer flights available, white castle baby, that's right, white castle, oh goddamn, that's good, fuck, now you got me craving. I'm not that hungry, thankfully I won't have to get it, but one of these days I'm going to have to get it now, thanks to you guys, you put it in my head, the fucking oh this greasy little guys, just pop them in, two bites, no one bite, bang, oh they're so good, what i get a covers, i get the butterburger, i mean nothing's as good as that butterburger because the butterburger is so much better than other fast food hamburgers, whereas like they have a really good chicken sandwich and they also have a pork uh tender loin sandwich which you will not find at most other fast food restaurants but the berg is so much better than other bergs, it's got the crispiness at the edge, oh god, when do i have my new grill, hopefully next week, fingers crossed. All right, I'm going to sign off in a minute here, so a couple questions, and I'm going to go make my dinner, which will not be white cause, got to remind myself, no white castle, it's going to be a regular uh uh car charcoal, I don't want to fuck with a grill, with a propane tank, I also don't really have room, but I did get, thank you, the one got the person who recommended the the stove type thing, the stove top, the stove pipe star. I got one of those, thank you, now I'm going to be set, I might have to get what what kind of uh apron would go well, maybe a a brewers aper and that'd be fun, I will, I will stream i will stream i swear it, God is my witness, I shall stream my grillings when I begin them, when I commence the grillings, my first, my virgin grill voyage, before I do anything bigger will be with you guys, how about that, I promise. All right guys, see you soon, mwah!
