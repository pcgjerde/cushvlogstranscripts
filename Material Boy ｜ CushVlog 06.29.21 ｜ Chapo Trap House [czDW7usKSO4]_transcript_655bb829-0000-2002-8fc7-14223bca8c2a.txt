 Hey the little red riding hood, you sure all looking good. you're everything, a big bad wol, listen to me, little red ridinhood, like to hold you if i could, but you might think I'm a big babble so I won't, oh what full lips to have the best? better to love you with, little red riding hood, even bad walls can be good, i try to be satisfied, just to walk close by your side, maybe you'll see things my way before we get to grandma's place, i'm going to keep my sheep suit on, till i'm sure that you've been shown that i can be trusted walking with you alone. all right, i've launched this into the ether. everyone's aware of what's happening here? uh, here we go, man, the forever purge, I'm so pissed, all right, so I have a long relationship with this purge franchise, the first, I remember distinctly when I first heard about the purge, it was not even seeing the movie, it was reading in on one of those awful movie websites years ago when I would just do that all day uh just indulge in this you know uh hamster ball just spin around in the wheels of like observing this culture and uh instead of actually doing anything with my life uh and i remember thinking this is just a really cheap way to get around the classic home invasion problem plot problem of why don't they just call the cops like you have to do something to explain why this house is going to be invaded over the course of this long without them you know being able to raise a neighbor and get people involved outside of uh the house you can only you know how how many times can it be a remote farm house in the middle of nowhere uh so hey what if crime is legal it just felt like a a plot copout and then the movie really did confirm that the movie is uh is really just a very by the numbers home invasion movie but then with the second purge, which is a really really good movie, uh, it seems like they're actually grasping that oh, like what would it actually mean to do this, like what, what, what would our society basically have to look like to have that be a thing, and how would it impact things, and in that respect, it got interesting, and those movies, I mean, obviously, you know, they're not revolutionary documents, nor they should, nor should... but this is a rare case where the infiltration of like political uh text uh is actually helpful because it's still in the realm of just you know pulp entertainment it it's as far as you can get from something that someone can really think is going to be politically meaningful it's it's it's yes it's politics but it's politics as aesthetics as it should be which is watch a movie and you know get riled up like like a John Carpenter movie it's like they they live I think would be would be a good comparison. into the purge movies in terms of their their uh their text level like how much how how uh how uh expressly political the texts are, it's about on par with they live, which I think is a great movie, so it's in that tradition, and all those movies have explored parts of it to better or less degrees, the election night is uh, okay, it's a bit of a letdown, there's some good stuff in it, but uh, it really does sort of uh, I mean obviously. politically it's it's very lib, it's very coutsky as opposed to Lenin, but uh, that's really not the problem, the problem is that it doesn't really take that whole like electoral. but interestingly enough, they don't they don't do enough with it. uh, and also their idea of like our ruling class is too parochial, it's too bush era. you know, it's like, oh, it's it's crazy christian fundamentalists, like no, that's not it. uh, but anyway, the the first purge, i think was really good, the first purge is probably the best one. the the first purge meaning the third or the fourth purge movie very confusing does something really interesting with the concept in terms of making it uh you know this overt political document this like 70 style agit prob uh but uh is marred by among other things the use of fucking CGI instead of squibs and bullets and it's just It's very distracting, they cheep out and it just so it's like a video game and you don't get like if this this genre is about visserality, this genre is about cheap thrills and that means when you see somebody get shot you want to imagine that that really is blood exploding out of their chest, I know that's sick, but that's what you're trying to get out of these movies, it's like some part of it is, and then they did a purge TV show and very quickly it dawned on me when that was announced how... that they really did not the people made this stuff the guy's name is like uh James DeAngelos or something is like the the the uh the singular genius behind the purge franchise is that they don't really get what's interesting about it they just keep hitting the same beats over and over again as many people have pointed out there's nothing in these purge movies about what other than people running around and ritually murdering each other people would be doing on that night because yes i don't i don't think you can download that there would be some significant ritual violence during something like this, this society has reached a point of of boil where that would absolutely be the case, are you kidding, people act like it's the purges uh, there's a millions of people in this country who act like the purge is real every day of their lives, it's just in terms of their practical uh application and and we know the results of that, but there's so much else. that could be going on and they really hit a wall creatively because they did a purge TV show and I thought oh you know it would be great here an anthology series where it's the different story every episode with a different thing happening in the purge and maybe they're all part of one greater uh like plot that gets tied up at the end but mix it up and instead they just did another thing that they done they did before uh and then uh only even more hand political than anything before, and then amazingly, they did a second season of the TV show where the purge ends in the first episode, and the rest of it is people is people like uh, trying to investigate what happened like at the very end of the purge, and so it's not during the purge, and now this new one is the like anti uh ice, anti uh immigration or anti-borders uh, you know, politically like what, the the first burge was... clearly the black lives matter purge and and the the this new forever purge is the uh is the uh immigrants rights movement purge and i got to say that's not that interesting to me especially if you're gonna say yeah now it's forever perge is forever and it really does show that if you're not going to get interested in the context uh in your like high concept it's going to wear out quickly it wore out. uh, it's what it is is they didn't know what else to make it to do to make it interesting, so i'm saying there's other things they could have done if they were a little more creative, like do some comedy, do financial crimes, do like complicated stuff, you could do some amazing like uh uh farce with the the uh like splitting the hairs between like the levels of weapon that are ex that are uh you know allowed to be used and stuff like that, so i will see the the the oh my god well there you have it folks, it finally happened. Well there you go, not gonna lie, that's pretty embarrassing, this fucking ikea ass chair uh, was held together with like bolts and it just absolutely exploded, hey, that's gonna be capped. Oh well, I really should just stop talking now, because what would any, why would anyone listen to anything I'd ever have to say after that? Good lord, what an own, god damn, I just got so owned, now fair enough, cap that if you must, because what am I gonna do, you know, it happened, oh well, madame chair exploded. hey, well I hope that was pretty funny, I hope it was funny, damn annihilated, well it was a nice run, rip to me. All right, boy, all right, I don't know, I don't, I'm gonna follow that, but let me give me a give me a minute, uh, well, that's the end of me. uh so anyway uh yeah thumbs down to the purge franchises running out of ideas. oh man what an oath yeah no i'm in i'm in my i'm in a new reality now i'm not i i didn't really even look at the sopranos thing i'm not that interested it i mean i'll i'll watch it probably but i don't know not really interested when or another, I'm really not, I'm not a fan of prequel stuff at this point, it really does feel like the tail eating, the the the the fucking, the snake eating its own tail, like culture consuming itself into extinction, like cannibalizing itself, because we cannot. there is no money to be made uh reliably in uh trying to create a new world for people to believe in, because they have no belief left, so all you can do is take those scraps of things that have worked, the things that have like proven themselves to have some sort of symbolic power and uh and just putting more money into that, you know, and you can say oh they might. try to do something good, but like it's essentially the same artificial constraints on storytelling that happened with the fucking superhero movies, like you are constrained, you aren't able to tell something that maybe would be... more authentic to the artist, whoever that might be, they're kind of chained by the existing intellectual property, literal intellectual property, like that's that's how it's organized, i mean like i think better call a lot of people love it, but for me that is the number one example of what i'm talking about, better call sall feels like it to me it could have been a really interesting show if the original elements of it hadn't been wed to breaking bad, i mean i really did not what really turned me off that show is when we found out oh how how hector got uh his got in a wheelchair yeah that that was something that was an uh an unanswered question of of like significance like that's not the kind of setressing that you just take for granted in any story you hear it only gains myth. relevance afterwards when you're trying to build on this fucking this carcass, this artistic corpse that you're just trying to pick over and reskin, so uh, no thank you to uh the whole trend of things that are just iterations of existing structures. and also i'm sorry how we get from uh how we get from Jimmy Macgil to Saulman is not uh an interesting uh arc to make as the basis for your show because that's not what anybody liked about Saulman, he was in a story that was about that, that was about like a a regular person becoming a criminal, like that was the whole Mr. chips to scarface, and you're literally just doing it over again. You're just saying, hey, remember that uh, arc thing that happened, here it is, again with a different character, it's the way that when they made that solo movie, right, everyone remember that, now maybe lord and... miller uh had a good idea for a solo movie that they fired them for making because it was too outside of the brand of Star Wars, but what they ended up making with Ron Howard is shit, and one of the big reasons it's shit is that it recapitulates the ark that hon solo has in the first trilogy, you're just having his character have the exact same conversion towards caring about the rebellion that he had in that movie and you could say, oh, maybe he gets disillusioned again between then and star wars, but who fucking cares? should tell a different story, and that's because it had to be in this box, it's it's all cannibalism, you're cannibalizing the corpse of like emotional connection that people have to these existing intellectual properties. and then just trying to smuggle in this stepped on dog shit, because who really cares about any of this stuff artistically, everybody is doing this stuff has already made so many compromises internally away from what they would want to do artistically that they essentially can't stop themselves because they are, once you're cooked into the system, once you've accepted a certain level of comfort in life and a certain level of uh ease and and lack of alienated labor, you take that for granted and then you organize your idea of art, your idea of what matters around that, and all of a sudden you find yourself becoming much more uh liberal, much more uh, much less confrontational with capitalism, and then you make things in that mold, and it's not as good as the stuff you would have made if capitalism wasn't determining, your your uh motives in that moment and it's like I'd rather not celebrate this decline, I would rather like hold a standard just because if you don't. you will be sucked into the abiss, you will be pulled into uh uh abstracting away from yourself all of your emotions and and vigor and and life and connection, not around the world in your moment, not around life experience, but this life remembered in the form of these symbols, these dead symbols that you're going to uh chase down the fucking uh drain. and that is the challenge that we all face, because we are all fixed in our positions, in our uh, in our lives, the things we do every day, the choices we make every day, by what we think of ours our material interest, so this is the essential insight of marxism right, or one of them anyway, i could say maybe the most essential in terms of building like an understanding of human relationships out of it. is that people are driven at base by their material interests, not an idea in their head, not any ideology, nothing but what is good for them in in a narrow self-interested sense. now through those people all interacting with each other, they build structures that create new relationships and those new relationships alienate us away from certain elements that we had taken for granted, and then all of a sudden we find ourselves in new arrangements against capitalism, perhaps, but because of our our lives lived, but always through the pursuit of material interests, and the pursuit of material interest determines everyone on every part of the chain that it is not the exclusive providence of the evil rich, they're not choosing to be self-interested because they're choosing evil, they are being self-interested because we all are, and they're better at it, because they're already next to money, that gives them more time to focus on it, it gives them a better ability to coordinate amongst each other. but it is still uh uh self-interest, it's the same way that class consciousness develops among the working class because of mutual conditions of exploitation and and it is understood oh my self-interest would actually be uh advanced by uh the collective self-interest being advanced and that we could do better together than alone and separate against these forces. that's the forge that creates class consciousness and it's all generated by material interests. now that insight is uncomfortable for a lot of people to accept and undermines a lot of people's uh uh credulity when they're engaging with these notions is that if that is true then there is no position for free will that we are we are fully determined in this condition if that's true it is clear cause and effect we're like pin we're like billiard balls in which case how are we to live? even if it's true, it's just like any question of free will, you have to assume free will, so what is the use of this doctrine if it proposes a mechanistic understanding of the universe where we have no place for agency, and the answer to that in my view is that when you say material interest, you are not referring to an objective interest, some sort of supernaturally idealistic form of what this person should do in every situation, that is not the material interest, what the material interest is is an individual's perception of their self-interest, which means it is not just pure profit seeking, it's profit seeking wrapped around all the cultural forms that that person has absorbed given where they emerged, what community they lived among, what norms govern them, what? values they absorb, what things do you want and what things do you not want, and that doesn't just mean sensation, it means social esteem, it means a sense of security and safety, it means love, it means all of those things and those things are not perceived as a market exchange, they are perceived as human interaction and experience, which means they wrap up around cultural, they're wrapped up and then reifified through culture, the steam rising from the vents of of material and action and so when people are trying to get figure out what theirself interest is, they are, it is, they are sorting through their culturally imposed uh values and then applying that to the question of every every material relationship in their life, so that means that material interests are only self-perceived, and that is why capitalism is suicidal. because there is no break that can be applied once it is fully uh uh uh once the machine is fully in motion and the momentum has accumulated sufficient the the brakes fall off. because if the only motive is material interest in the most narrow sense, you will eventually get to a situation where competition spurred on through technolog and uh technological competition over resources is going to uh essentially cook your fucking planet because as resources go away as entropy enters the system, extranous conceptions, extranious notions, other than self-preservation can no longer be afforded, and so all of those that gossom or falls away and what's left then is material interest, and that is why at the sharpest ends of the distribution, material interest is most self-aware. people, the very wealthy understand their material interests much more usually, i mean that that's going away, but that's going away for all of us, because we're getting demented, our brains are being destroyed by capitalism, we're being hollowed out by the algorithm. buse the algorithm says uh, extract value of others for oneself, it is taking the labor of others and and holding it them yourself and using whatever degree of culture, and technology is necessary to maintain that relationship, it is, it is exploitation, and that can only go, and that can only uh operate if there is not a human understanding of value that is not self-interested, otherwise the self-interest becomes narrow, all community bonds explode and and are shattered and are replaced by regimes of technological. enforcement that alienades fully from ourselves so that we don't get to choose anything, but at the very top end, material interests are felt, at the bottom, material interests are felt, because material interests are, how do I stay alive, how do I stay alive, how do I keep a roof over my head? material interests are well understood, the land of politics is the land in the middle is where we live, the land of politics is for those people who are comfortable. enough to have a conception of uh of self-interest that is beyond oneself, because they have some sort of faith in a community to maintain their security and to to provide them with the chance to advance, to feel the good things we want to feel, to feel all the good stuff and to not feel the bad stuff that is the the basic the basis of a material interest, we want to feel the good feelings and not feel the bad feelings. That's what we that's uh, that is what we want shorne of all uh language, but what that means has a cultural dimension? the more in the middle you are, the more precarious you are, where the more you feel the need to invest in politics as a mechanism to change things, because it makes you feel like you're in control, at one end people know they're in control, at the bottom end people know that they're not in control and can't be in control. that means we are governed by the algorithm of self-preservation, everyone for themselves, because we're at the end of the the uh, we are at the point where the entropy has exacerbated through the system so much that there's they're going to it's going to destabilize the structures that allow the distribution of resources that we call this civilization. um, it will all be undermined by self-seeking narrowly understood. self-interest, because we won't be any money to afford anything else, and technology will have taken over enough of the decision making that there's going to be plenty of room for the people who can be rich. and live with themselves while the machine grinds everybody else up, and that really is a fight, that's the civil war uh that defines politics in America, it is a civil war between different factions of our ruling class, between the fixed capital of of of the uh, of like the land-based economies of the American Hinderland versus coastal uh finance capitalism, and they are the... two ends of a poll defined by time and space, coasts, central areas, former agricultural and industrial bases and coastal areas of trade and finance, most importantly, and then the cultures that are arrayed around them are all cultures of those middle sectors representing those interests in the culture, that's our that's our politics. civil war between these factions that can no longer recognize each other because of the atomizing and isolating uh and depersonalizing and alienating effects of capitalism, it's stripping the rich of their sense of autonomy too, and they're expressing it through alienation from each other, through much a narrow self-seeking, through a lack of any long-term investment in any stable uh uh economic structures, they have lost that. and that is why you get a situation where the rich are steering the boat for in terms of human uh human agency, the wealthy, the transnational, the the... that actually run this thing that move the levers of this fucking thing that play the piano in the in the saloon, they have less and less discretion over what to do than anybody in their position in history, even while they have more actual control over it than any other group of people on earth. and that means that they predominate, they're able to express their will, what they think is their will on on an unprecedented number of people thanks to technology and globalization, but they're not even in charge, and they don't, they don't feel in charge, and they're the breakup of civil society is their uh, their the lack of faith, the the crisis of faith they're having in the state to be vessels of their uh continued control. and that's not what any of those rich people would want to have happen, they don't want this to happen, they are trying, they've been trying to steer the ship away from this their whole lives, and everybody in charge has always been trying to steer away for this, but the runway has run out, the breaks have failed, there's too much uh feedback in the loop now, it's destabilizing things. and so people have willed us here without wanting it to be the case, people have willed us here without it being their direct desire, and that is why material interest is not deterministic, because it is, it ends up depending on how all of us as individuals process the world around us and then individually like try to live in that world as liberal subject. but what that material interest is is not their interest, it is the interest that their society gives them, it's what it's the value. aggregated behaviors that organize around these material interests and then those end up inscribing themselves on the land that those are the ones that build institutions. and that build legitimacy, and then a language around them, a vocabulary around them, and uh, a coordinated effort around them, the the self-interest of the ruling class, the self-interest eventually of the working class, that is how those things are generated, and so that would also seem to be fixed, you're saying, yeah, but these things are determined and you're fixed in this web of of like demographics and happen stands, but you're also moving through time, entropy is entering the system, things are moving, the fucking uh, the butterflies are flapping their fucking wings, which means you're re-encountering the world at every turn, and and every moment you have new relationships to all of the things around you, your relationships to labor, your relationships to uh culture, your own identity, and those things. and that is where new forms come from that then interact with the material reality, and that's why for an individual, at the individual level, the challenge is to recognize where you are in this chain and try to just break the break the machine. break the mechanistic determined relationship between a stimuli and your reaction to it, not your necessarily your thought about it, but your reaction to it, because that's gap is the only freedom any of us really have, that little moment in time where we can consider and then and then change our perception and change our approach to the world that we're surrounded by. and that is coope that needs to be said, this is all incredible cope, and yes of course, because all of these thoughts I've been having are in the context of recognizing that the war between the classes was one by capital, that we are now in a crisis of capitalism. because the the breaks that class resistance, that counter hegemonic resistance to capitalism used to provide are broken, that doesn't mean that new structures won't be forged out of this crisis, but it is a terminal crisis and so the question of what to do probably isn't at the level of who do you vote for, certainly not for fucking president, maybe at the local level, and i would say at the local level, yes, because you might be able to build actual... uh actionable networks out of those uh relationships because they're people who are in the same area, there are people who can help each other, but that like national electoral politics where you're talking about, oh are we going to get rid of the phillibuster, oh are we going to add DC as a state to get a few more senators, as though there's anything like the time to address the situation through those channels without a channel challenge to the very edifice that they are part of, i think is unrealistic, that doesn't mean people shouldn't vote, but it certainly means that if you are counting on voting to be where the the action is, and not just sort of a a social ritual, a recommitment of yourself to a commonwealth, entertainment element that keeps you invested in the world around you, and and and keeps you talking to other people, buse remember, well this stuff night might matter. It's what people care about, so you want to be able to talk to people about it, you want to be engaged, because that's how most people understand politics, but the results that happen there are not going to be determinative, the results that happen locally are going to be determinative, the results that create robust infrastructures of resistance are going to be what matters, and that's why I think in LA, for example, where I recently come, there is a very impressive effort to make attempt to grab control of the uh the city council uh in LA uh from like the coalition of of you of you know unions and machines that run it now of course the terror there is everyone thinks immediately aoc oh god we're talking about all of the awful uh questions of sheep dipping and and uh and the PMC takeover and all this crap. that happens because those fucking representatives have no accountability to anybody. what the fuck can anybody do about Aoc? no one thinks that she's part of their team or wants to kick her out of the tent of their team has any real influence over her, but the local level at the council level, you can actually potentially, because especially because the voting pools are generally smaller and more concentrated, you can actually wield block like influence over uh your local politicians in a way that changes the stakes and makes you have to orientation your whole up understanding of what the politics are, it makes you have to give up a lot of your ego based uh fixations on uh like ritualized positions on things for one, like you might actually have to sacrifice some uh idealized notions on the altar of um of practicality, which had never come into anybody's mind, because no power has ever been wielded on the left, if you do get local local power, it's going to... to come with the necessity of real politique that I don't think a lot of people are ready for, because purity politics has been the sum total of politics for most people adult lives, there's been nothing other than your the purity of your position, and this isn't to blame anybody for that, it's not to say you're being a culture of narcissist, PMC because of that, there is no other thing to base it on, because there is no actual power, there is only a daily like self-understanding of who you are in a fallen world, what else are you supposed to do? but when power is on the table, you have to reorient yourself, and it's going to be a big challenge, and i honestly don't know how it's going to shape up, it could create a like a bad feedback loop that generally genuinely does like undermine everything, or you know uh, it could be a situation where the momentum of power has its own inverting ability its own um its own uh persuasive power, like if you actually get something done as opposed to be told something's going to get done and then it never actually does, if you actually have a situation where you votes someone for someone, they do something, and then if they don't, you stop, so they do what you want them to do, if you actually have that the stakes. change, the stakes change, and it more than anything clarifies action, because your decisions are not no longer, well what position am i going to take on this, because all i'm going to be doing all day is reinforcing what i believe by expressing it to other people, what if i'm actually doing something, like participating in something. like active in it, all of a sudden the stakes are much closer to my moment and it clarifies what I should do because the actual moment can be viewed clearly because it's in front of you, it's not in the ether, it's not in this machine that rewards novelty and righteousness over everything, and that is why I think the uh absolute, the only response to have uh to this whole stupid online argument about Stalin and whether he's good or bad, the most tedious argument ever, one of them anyway, that comes up over and over again, uh, can be answered by not, by not even engaging with the the the genuinely bourgeois, sentimental bullshit about number of bodies and stuff like that, which anyone? with elementary understanding of material analysis would say that's bullshit uh fucking Churchill had six million uh Bengallis on his hands and he he fucking laughed about it throughout the the entire war he thought it was he thought it was a basically a giant like prank from uh one of his disgusting uh English public schools. Who cares about that? Stalin was a fucking cow. a bitch and a loser and that's what matters. Stalin did an incredible thing in building the Soviet Union if you want to give him credit for it, which is of course stupid in the first place, because another reason all this discourse is ridiculous, there's no, the power does not reside in the person that way, you're actually doing like mysticism to imbu one dude with the entire like agency of the soviet project that's stupid. He built this thing, him and him in the system that he presided over created this formation. this thing that was not capitalism that was developmental without the profit at the heart of it. now it was as capitalism had been in insanely bloody in its development, had run blood from stones, had turned peasants into mulch, because that's what you do, that is what that's what progres in civilization is, it is pulling people away from the land, it is pulling resources away from the land, it is reducing uh the need for. uh uh reducing milds basically in the countryside so that consumption can happen in the cities, and that is where you build state, you build capital, you build an economy, you build state capacity, you build something that can compete on the West Faleion stage of of of state competition that emerged in Europe in 177. which is the context for all the developments of capitalism and soviet of communism and everything else. that is, that is the the train that gave birth to everything, it's that competition. and so communism did what capitalism did, it killed a lot of peasants and it effectively distributed resources enough to leap frog historical development stages far faster than capitalism would have allowed for, because capitalism parcels out that violence. and parcelling out that violence was harder for the Soviets because their empire was a multiethnic empire, their empire was relatively homogeneous as opposed to the empires of Europe which were racially divided, so you could have safe, cozy social democracies in the heartland and brutal extraction at the edges, couldn't do that the Soviet Union, everybody's a slave basically. certainly everybody where there's any food is a slave, and so you got to do it to your own people, which makes your system poisonous in in in world memory in a way that the European imperial powers aren't because of that racial difference, so they did what the capitalism did much faster to their own people, and they fought off an existential attack by this monstrous national capitalist mutant in the form of this the the nazi state that was going to solve the problem of of of capitalism and culture under capitalism by creating a a master race for who would have all rights and therefore all liberties and all material uh all material interests met, any kind of conceivable material interest met and then other human. either extinguished or provide the slave labor and are outside of humanity, essentially libertarianism because libertarianism is the same end state, it is not the end of human misery and human exploitation and suffering and oppression, it is the codening off of that into an other group whose pain is not felt by the community, the Soviet Union didn't do have that, they did it internally, but it gave them a chance to fight off this. attempt to snap off uh a a middle-class society and just dominate the world with it technologically, they weren't there yet, international capitalism was the only force in the world with the ability to organize and coordinate material relationships because it have been developed in the anglosphere, it developed in the American common law tradition of free real estate and exppropriation of... a foreigner, the assimilation into an into a cultural infrastructure, that made it more supple, more able to coordinate resources and able to, and and it was the survival of the fits really, but then the Soviets who had turned away from the permanent revolution, had turned away from igniting the war in Europe that everybody understood needed to have. happened to save the soviets from doing what they did to their peasantry, he cut off that possibility to save the soviet experiment because he thought otherwise it was going to collapse, and maybe he was right. the only other off ramp for this was buukarin, buying off the pesants and slowly reintroducing capitalism in the countryside, which honestly might have been the best choice, but i understood, i stand why they didn't do it, and if they don't do it, then you have to foreclose on the world revolution, you have. to become another state among states mercilessly competing for power, for self, for survival, but then you do it, and then you get to the end of it, and then you fucking turn up your... belly your final chance with the final confrontation with capitalism that you've spilled oceans of blood to afford and you bitch out because you are too addicted to your to your position, you're either as your stalin or anybody in the soviet bureaucracy, you are too addicted to the comforts of not bourjois society, but whatever uh new bureaucratic class that they composed, they weren't going to give it a uh, there was a chance that they could have given it up if they had really embraced cybernetics in the 50s and 60s and created machinery that could reproduce the price signal, but then what would they have had to do? they would have had to get real jobs, bureaucracy is necessary to the is is it needs to exist to the degree, it's necessary, but if material interest is dominating people, and because these are still western subjects, these people were not "these people were essentially not the workers who arose to take over Soviet Union, it was this cadre of of agitated middle classes who sees control of the of the bourgeois state in the 1917 uh revolution, but once you have a self-sustaining bureaucracy, it's understanding of the good of the of uh the revolution." the good of communism becomes the their own self-interest and they don't even recognize that the two are identical and they pursue one and the other thinking they're doing the best thing for the Soviet Union, but they're really undermining it from within. No, no, we can't allow the price signal to be determined rationally, because then what are we going to do? Are we going to have to get real jobs? Are we going to have to work in a factory too? Are we going to have to do useful, socially useful work too? fuck no, who wants to do that, and I agree. That's what they signed up for though, when they decided to play the game after the civil, after uh world war to, when they decided to fight the west on the terms of markets and uh outputs and consumption and economic development through consumption, and that wasn't Krushchev's fault, people put it on Krushchev, it was Stalin's fault, this needs to be emphasized, Salin set the stage so that by the... time Krushchev took power, he had no other options. The other option was Beria trying to do Glasnose 50 years earlier. I don't know if anybody is aware of this, but uh, if any, if you saw death of Stalin, they really uh, they speed things up very quickly. Barria was head of a troika that ruled after Stalin's death for almost a year, before Zukov and Krushchev got together to to cool their asses. Barry's move was to. essentially in exchange for a Russian Marshall plan stepping down out of a conflict with um capitalism completely, a formal surrender, that was bottle mine, this monster, one of the most disgusting gools to be coughed up by the Stalinist state, and he was he would have been the man of the year, he would have been the hero of the millennian in in the west, if he had pulled that off, and Krushchev cough him, and yes, then he pursued botched agricultural policy and a consumer economy, but he had to, because Stalin had set the stage, because Stalin, even after building that state, was afraid to use it when the time was right. Stalin after the war is in the same position the German Social Democrats were after World War One, and he made the same decisions and the Russian bureaucracy made the same decisions, because they had been bourjoified by their conditions of life and traumatized of course by the fucking purges. uh and just the the sheer um the you know uh trauma of the war of the civil war years and of the fucking famin years and then the fucking world war two my god maybe he doesn't have to go to war over Greece right away but he has to not do what he did which was allow Bretton Woods. the fucking anaconda plan of Bretton Wood system to strangle Russian fucking communism by turning it into a maximal buse yes oh we got to feed these uh we got to get out consumer goods for these people how are we going to do that well we got to work our workers harder whereas in the west give give more of these material comforts to your working class and they don't have they get to they have to work less because somebody else in the third world is working more. somebody else in the newly created third world is working more, so he gets to work less, so he'll keep working and and maximal efficiency, meanwhile, if all you're offering is consumption and the... in the consumer goods suck, but there was no other way they could have, they could, you can't win, you can't win, if you're operating from an idea of material interest that is selfish, you will, you will eventually commit social suicide, oh somebody says the Soviet Union needed control of the Helaspont. period, the fucking Xars knew it, the Zars were the dumbest people on earth and they fucking knew that you needed the heller spont if you were going to compete with Europe, that's why they went to World War One, Russia was too backwards to compete with Europe, unless they had something like the fucking hellaspont, did Stalin direct his post war foreign policy around getting the hella spont, no. what he did was he allowed capitalism to gather its strength to wage a war in the in the rest of the world to dominate and control resources in terrains that the soviets were afraid to tread and making them putting them in a position where they can't win, putting them in checkmate allowed by because stalin stalin let the west set the chess board, he let the set let them set the conditions of play before they started, so that is why I think there is nothing more tedious than argue about whether Stalin was good or bad, he was a loser, somebody says I have incurable alternative history brain, that is 100%. I cop to that, I am uh, I'm all about the counterfactual, but as as Walter Shel has pointed out, counter factuality is literally how you think of history, you can only relate historical realities by contrasting them to things that didn't happen, so you're creating a ghost image of history as you conceive of it, and then it's always going to be intriguing to just wonder where the intersections are, the portals were between one determined reality and another, because I really do believe that that that randomness is in the system sufficient to create wormholes of possibility that are b that are that bore through every other overdetermined physical interaction and that in that is the sum total of human agency, the the awakening of the world spirit is in that, it's the ghost in the machine that is so... being extinguished, like our spirit is being extinguished by capitalism, it is not overrought or adbusteries to to say that, in a very real sense, this gets me back to material interest, our understanding of our material interest is different than it used to be, at every level of society, at every level of experience, people living now, experiencing this world now, are doing it with a more impoverished sense of interest, a more personally focused, less communally validated notion of interest than people did before, and I want to give an example of this, not divided by from us necessarily to them, but within time space, so when I say that, I say, everybody now has a different and more narrow understanding of of material interest than they used to. That means at every level of society. every type of person that exists now that fills the ranks of our social classes and reproduces social behaviors now, people to the degree that that same position existed in the past, it's still situated with other ones, but within them they all had a more socially capacious understanding of self and material of material interest, so to contrast two different. people are three different people i guess within one time span across uh like personal axis of experience uh has anybody seen the movie uh the founder about Ray Crock starring Michael Keatan uh a very very good movie directed written by uh Robert Seegel the guy who also wrote big fan and directed big fan which is a also a very good movie so I'm going to do some slight spoilers here the movie is about how the process by which this this itinerant salesman uh, this guy had been on the grind trying to get rich uh with like ronko level schemes since uh world two uh Ray Crock uh finds these uh brothers who had created a new system for uh for fast food delivery literally uh an efficient distribution of labor within a within a kitchen to vastly increase the output of a uh restaurant and he and the movie about how he got his brothers to sign over uh to him to allow him to franchise it, his creation of this franchise model that swepts the nation and then his eventual uh consumption of the brothers, he ends up uh buying the brothers out of their control of the company, taking away their restaurant that they had created where the first mcdonald's uh so that they had to call it something else and then he put up a mcdonald's next to it and ran it out. just destroyed these guys who had actually created the thing and that's the story and it's about and michael peeton plays the guy so the McDonald Brothers and Ray Crock these characters are all what we would call capitalists right by within i mean by by the time uh krock is like incom is fighting them by the time krock is is exercising control the company these are all capitalists but they do not share material interest even though they are the same class even though they're part of the same project. the McDonald Brothers in a sequence that's one of my favorite scenes in recent movies and something that honestly they could teach and i'm not surprised the Prager University hasn't used this thing as a pay on to the glories of capitalism like this is a story that is like would be in any textbook to talk about that wants to talk about the possibility of the... dream, which is that you can through your own ability, will, gumption, and vision and creativity, you are able to write your will in the world, that is the American train, writing your will in the world is the dream of socialism too, but it is a collective dream, we don't have that, we have the individual dream, that is our material understanding, is the individual dream, and it is in this thing where uh the brothers played by nick offerman as uh as ray and uh john carol linch ak zodiac as uh as maurice macdonald and sees the restaurant is blown away by it sees their system takes them to dinner and wants to hear the story and they tell it and you can tell right away that they've been waiting to tell this story to somebody they're incredible proud of it, they tell it with theatrical panache, uh, John Carolynch is just like absolutely hamming it up in a very, very credible way, nick offerman is like doing this very bemused, understated thing, they're clearly just having a ball, because they did this thing and they want someone to know about it, and they tell the story about how these guys came from New Hampshire to LA to be in movies, and I think that's incredibly important, these guys didn't want to be capitalists, they wanted to be. they had the artist spirit, their first instinct was not to start a business, it was to get in the dream factory, maybe you start as a grip and make your way up to a director, you get to be a stuntman or maybe you get to be cast as like one of those guys in a 50's movie like the comic relief has his pants all the way up to here and like is always falling in troughs and then they did they they were like extras they were stunt man they washed out of the... then they tried to do a movie theater, they wanted to be a movie theater, if they couldn't be in the movies, they wanted to be around the movies, these are people who do not want their material interests, their understanding of their interests was not material acquisition over everything, they wanted something else, something that could only be achieved socially through expression and coordination with others, and then the movie theater was killed by the depression, and then they had and find something to do, so they got a restaurant, and then they applied their artistic temperaments to the restaurant, and it was literally the the bringing together of these two uh artistic temperaments, this guy who wanted to create a machine, a beautiful machine and this person who wanted to uh package it and express it, built this thing, and there's the montage of them sketching out the the uh kitchen on a uh tennis court. having people go around, there's one scene, there's one shot where Nick Orferman is literally standing over these people, coordinating the actions, waving his hands like he's a conductor going, relish, ketchup, he's literally conducting an orchestra. Ray Crock, here's the story. Now, Ray Crock has no creative anything. Sky has no desire to be uh, appreciated for his soul, his self-expression. He wants to be recognized as better than somebody else, higher up than somebody else. This is a guy who has been his whole life trying. to get rich, has lived beyond his means, is probably married to a rich woman, lives in uh, goes to a country club with a bunch of rich guys who all look down on him, he is the perfectly aggrieved nixonian subject, he's been he's a 50-year-old man who's reciting the same speel about fucking uh mult uh mult machines to disinterested driving hosts and he's he has nothing left to care about uh anything other than getting a getting some validation through uh advancement, through social advancement, power, money, all that stuff, so here's the story, and he just wants to make money out of it, and so once they start the company, uh, the McDonald Brothers are keep pulling the rains on him, keep saying, no, no, don't do this, we have values that uh, are transcend money, and he's saying, what are you talking about, I just need to make money. more and more, I need money, what are you talking about? And these are both people on the same class position, share if you wanted to use one word for it of the same material interest, but have different material interests as they understand them because they're different people have different experiences, and that is true in every strata of society, every given moment in time. Both of those guys are republicans, those those guys are happy to exploit. for their vision, are happy to use the capitalist system to their benefit, but towards different ends, towards a more social end and towards a personal acquisitive end, and the thing about capitalism is that it is a magnet that pulls people like Ray Crock up and pulls people like the McDonald Brothers down, because the system rewards the person who is most interested in making money. by definition, because that's what the system does, it points like a north star those within an firmament who are most aware of their self-interest as narrow, are most blind to abstract notions of value to socially stored systems and portions of value, expressions of value i should say, so they have different material interests and so over time, ray crock, what do you know, gets the upper hand on the mcdonald's boys even though they had an iron clad contract, he's able to get together with another guy who tells him, hey you should have these guys be buying the land from you, and then if you control the land, your leverage changes, he didn't think of that, but he uses it to get to pry one over and to dominate the mcdonald's boys and to take it from and to impoverish them, he runs them out of business, even though they're both capitalist with the same material interest. because his interests are more narrow and because they are, he's willing to do things the McDonald's brothers aren't, and it means that eventually his power is socially rewarded enough that he's able to win, because who cares what the law says, the reality is if he's got more liquidity, more access to capital than they do, then there is no legal question that he won't win, because he can wait them out, yes, sum me, I will drag it out. and i have more money than you, because he's willing to do things they won't, because he's willing to cut corners they won't, he's willing to ignore values that transcend money, they won't, and then that happens at every level of the economy, over and over and over again, that process happens, so that now we have reached, it's now 70, what 80 years later, almost 100 years later, and now the McDonald's are gone, everybody is raycrock. the McDonald's have been driven out of the system, pulped out, those artistic talents, they either lie dormant, they are destroyed, or somebody makes it on the margins of society or or takes a precarious labor, falls out of power, becomes politically radicalized, maybe. It's the bad driving out the good, exactly uh, and it's all bad now, there's only. uh, there are still people doing art, there are still people doing entrepreneurship, there are still doing things that have that associated historic relationship to self-expression or autonomy, but they are now crabbed and broken and small, and everyone to pursues them has compromised so much that they don't get the pleasures they used to be out of it, and so they have to reconsider their self-interest as more narrowly, because there's no other place to get validated than narrow self. pleasure, because there's no other pleasures to be had. won't the ray crocks eventually turn on each other though? i mean, that's what we have right now. right now, like in a larger sense, the battle between the republicans and the democrats, between those two capital and social formations. is the battle between the people who are in the mcdonald's brothers positions, not in terms of like ingenuity and and brilliance or anything, but local local concentrations of capital are at war with the Ray Crocks, only everybody is Ray Crock, the only thing that still exists is the social distinction, if you know what I mean, because they still do have different understandings of their material interests. but they are no longer being defined by this conflict over values, because the values have desiccated and fallen away, they're now just the forms of the values, they're just the shadows left by the nuclear incineration of the values. it's private equity versus like the local uh tire store conglomerate or or restaurant. franchise and those guys are those guys are like those type of guys are the actual social engine in terms of the people made up the voters, the candidates, the ideology, the provide the money for the conservative counter reaction that started in the 50s, it was those aggrieved guys, not the McDonald's brothers who had a song in their heart, it's the post-defeated mcdonald's brothers, it's the it's the ones who never had anything in the first place. the ones who were like local just power seekers, but who were local in their power, and from the uh the the it really you can pinpoint it from when Robert Taft had the Republican convention stolen from him, the nomination stolen from him by Isenhower and Wall Street. you can begin that, that is the beginning of the creation of the guys who storm the capital, like that is that that was the the big bang of that specific social trajectory, trump and then whatever the hell we have now, this this populist right reaction to globalization. So that's material interest, it's what binds us in this uh deterministic web, but it's also moment to moment what liberates us from it, is the fact that there is until we get to the end, until you become Jeff. there is a sheath, a human sheath around that understanding, because remember, we don't even know what our best interests are, if they're abstracted beyond our noses, so even our self, even even, there can be no objective perception of our self-interest, even in the narrow, even in the short term, and of course then you get the con the conflict between the short term and the long-term interest, but even beyond that you can't even know the short-term one all the time. The virtualization of the economy. is what this is all leading towards, I mean, the creation of of cryptocurrency in general is is example of that, there the fact that you have uh, Facebook has a trillion dollar valuation at a time when you know real real construction, total value of those industries is a fraction of that, there's nowhere to put the money that can be profitably brought back in production, there's nothing you can produce profitably anymore, the margins are too narrow, it ends up costing more to make, you we are at the end point that that uh marks predicted, but it's being propped up by the creation of an abstract shadow economy. taking those transactions and then generating economic activity out of those transactions, out of the out of the um ether essentially, creating fictions around them and then and then trading the fictions, but that's all it is, but because it's technological now, because it is virtual, because it moves at the speed of the global like cybernetic mind, we've now reached the point. where you can do micro transactions where you where you're trading stocks in a fraction of a second and accumulating guaranteed profits over time. that can only happen because there's nowhere else for the money to go, the money is being directed more and more into the virtual realm, into finance, into all this, because there's nowhere else you can put it, you put it in as a loss leader to finance now all actual productive capacity, all our actual productive economy is a loss leader for finance, oh and the other thing about um, I wanted to say about. is one of the great things about Crock is a character as depicted in the film is that in contrast to the incredibly inventive uh proud uh stolid mcdonald brothers um crock learns nothing has no connection to anything his desire is totally unmored from any any enjoyment beyond self-validation it's totally arid at the beginning of the movie while he's is still trying to pep himself up to be a milkshake salesman, he uh, he's listening to this Dale Carnegy tape or this Dale Carnegy uh um record on a portable player in his hotel room, and it's just just speel about how persistence is the key to success, and he's repeating it, and he's repeating it, and then he goes through this whole thing where he gets the McDonald's brothers and he he swindles them out of it, he takes credit for it, he calls his first franchise mcdonald's number one, he starts referring him to himself as the founder, he buys their name from them because it's clean and crisp and american and you can make it into anything, the end of the movie he's giving a speech before Ronald Reagan when he was governor of California and it's like recapitulating everything that happened and he's practicing the speech in the front of the mirror and it's just the fucking Dale Carnegy uh record, it's just the same thing he's been listening to for. for 40 years, just a hollow, he's just, it's just a all he can do is echo, this voice saying grind, persist, because it's all that's ever animated in and nothing has been accumulated, nothing has been learned, and he spends the whole time succeeding because of the efforts of harder working or more uh, more creatively minded, operators who come up with things at every point that he then takes credit for, because he's the guy with the money. all right, i've already gone, but anyway, so i think that's another reason that's a great movie, because not only does it show you how capitalism develops, it shows you what capitalism does to people, and more importantly how the kind of people who thrive in it remake us in their image. through their ability to persist like a fucking fungus, like a bacteria, and it can only be carried out by hollow people, and uh, and they they demonstrate the crock is completely hollow, all right, I already gone too long and I've uh owned myself. so I'm gonna tap out, thank you for understanding, I swear to god, I'm not getting that fat, I'm not that fat, it's a poorly put together, IKEA chair, I swear to Christ, ah boy.
