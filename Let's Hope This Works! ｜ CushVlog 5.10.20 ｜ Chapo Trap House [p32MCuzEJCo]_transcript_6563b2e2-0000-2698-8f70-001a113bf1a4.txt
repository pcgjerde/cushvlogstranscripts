 exited host mode finally. Oh no, got that volume off, no, thank you. Hello everyone, back outdoors, beautiful day today, apparently it snowed here yesterday, good lord, dismal tide, there was a polar vortex, a polar vortex, they say, and ain't a crazy world we live in, they got to sell tickets, anyway, it's much nicer today, apparently it's going to rain tomorrow, but then hopefully. nicer later in the week, which is good, I'm hoping we have at least one more good month or so to eventually just give up on our uh plee to stay indoors and say fuck it like everyone else is, because I've really thought about it and uh, I don't see any other way this goes, somebody wanted, I mean something could change, you could, we could have a huge uh rupture in the in the circumstances, but man, the way it's looking now. it really looks like they're just going to say fuck it, and they're not even going to say it is the thing, they're just going to let it happen, they're going to go, oh the doors are open, oh you guys, oh jeez, these these states have they're open now, oh well, you know, if you want to, I mean, we're not going to be doing anything, just so you guys know, there's no point to your quarantine, and that's the real thing that's going to kill it, is eventually people are going to realize that this whole stand stores for everyone else, you know, London during the blitz solidarity thing we're doing, clapping and all that, it was all predicated on buying time to have a way to go back to normal that incorporated the risk of the disease in a way to keep it from spreading too far, and that would have required doing something like what South Korea is doing or whatever, and the thing is that we have done nothing, they have done nothing but cover each other's asses. because it's all a bunch of absolute croook crooked incompetent ofs, it's the biggest collection ofs we've ever had in a government, true clown hours, all of them are just trying to like at all those cabinet meetings for corona, you know what they're actually doing, they're all selling each other multi-level marketing shit, like one of them is buying those uh those mormon uh yoga pants and the other one is selling like a time shares or something, it's absolute criminality, one's got their hand out, nobody knows anything, and most of them are genuinely loyal to Trump, at least in the sense that they don't want to piss him off, because they know that he could turn on them any moment, which means that even though they know he's a moroon, when he says things like don't test people early on, they do it because they don't want him to get mad, and now we're in a situation where there's we just dicked around the whole time, all we did was dick around and then slowly and surely because everyone is miserable and there was nothing to do and we don't have any other way of expressing misery in this culture. oh, it became a culture war issue, and now staying in is for libs and cucks or slash responsible reality-based community members, uh, and going outside is for you know, patriots slashchuds, and that's that's the battle lines now, so like today they're opening up some restaurant in Colorado and it's all full, and people are high and people are mad at those people, but I mean yes, they're being very responsible, they're very being very selfish, but you're also, they're also operating in a context where their sacrifice is just not supposed to mean anything, where there is no part of a plan that it plays, it's just delaying the inevitable, so people are just eventually because they got to go to work or because they just can't stay inside, they're going to make the choice, the selfish individual choice to come out, and then more are and more are, and what we're only thing we're going to end up doing to deal with it is normalize dying of corona as a thing that happens now. as a thing that's just one of those things, just one of those things that happens to you, like a zombie apocalypse, but like we get the zombies down to a level where you know there's like a 5% chance when you go out that a zombie is going to bite you, um, so I think that's going to be it, and the only. real question is going to be whether the system can actually absorb all the sick people and whether people enough of them make the plunge to get the economy going again uh and those are questions I'm not quite sure of a lot of... has to do uh with how the virus responds to weather, how it how it mutates uh, you know, how it's when it starts hitting uh populations that are you know haven't really experienced it yet, and don't really have any kind of uh plan for it, I don't know, I have no idea, but I would say that it is likely that we do some sort of uh, we we scale up medical facilities. in a very fast way, not as fast as China, of course, but in a fast enough way to facilitate excess capacity from you know 9/11 every day worth of people dying from corona and of course thousands and thousands more getting sick enough to go have to go to the hospital and so we have more facilities to an extent so it's not completely uh you know uh wrenches in the gears and it can't function anymore uh but then a lot of triage and we just actually have fucking death panels they just full on Republicans of course, the guys who called uh Obamacare death panels are now going to actually administer legit death panels uh Eric Trump is going to be a member of a three-judge committee with two of his sorority his fraternity brothers who buried a sex worker with in college they're going to decide whether your grandmother gets a ventilator or not or whether you get one actually depending on how much you contribute to society and there's going to be all these wonderful metrics we can get from all these tech companies that have been basically hoovering up every piece of data in our lives until now to use to uh determine who's naughty and who's nice and then that becomes another way to uh to condition people because now another reason to stay on the beam is to uh make sure you get access to healthcare because you could get sick at any minute now and of course most of our attention and anger is going to go towards our fellow citizens like when this thing when the damn blow and we're in a new normal where just like thousands of deads death dead people as assumed, you know uh, we're not just going to blow it off, we're not just going to completely normalize it, we're going to have a lot of excess alienation, just horror that is going to have to be expressed and it's going to be expressed mostly at who we blame, and that's going to be like the chinese, uh, a lot of the the democratic governors are going to get a lot of anger from uh conservatives and the libs are going to be really really mad. Trump, of course, and the stupid idiot people who disobeyed orders to stay in and wouldn't wear masks and stuff, and don't watch Cole Bear so they don't what they're supposed to think about things, and then that's where the energy is going to go, and that's why I think Biden winning could honestly, man, if this recovery, if this, if this depression is as bad as it seems and Biden is in there, like I said James B cannon, and I think that becomes more and more true every day, it feels like because that's going to be a lot of social angst, that's going to be a lot of anger, that's going to be a lot of confusion, that's going to be honestly literally just a coursening of the culture because we're going to be that much closer to death around us, it's going to be less taboo, we're going to care less, we got a lot of guns, and uh the idea of this you know cynambulant mummy democrat uh presiding over you know a new normal of uh of of just course and ex economically depressed society, it's not good, it's not fertile ground for, just historically that hasn't been fertile ground for good stuff to appear, whereas if Trump's president and this is going on, there's a it's basically going to be a question of whether he's able to export enough blame to like China, which he would require to basically go to war with China to really fulfill the amount of blame they'd have to take for this to avoid him, or he would actually maybe get a point where he's alienated a significant chunk of people, not necessarily his base who love him, but people who don't think politically and now have politics in their face in the form of you, becoming a a ensurpened essential worker or kept in their homes or have a loved ones die or be uh refused access to healthcare, there's going to be enough of of you a trail of bloody uh fingerprints that him in charge while this whole thing is the whole horror of this thing is sinking in it could really create. like a a positive polarization uh and and uh, but yeah, but biden in there is really terrifying. Biden's terrifying, because I don't how you get anything other than like some half ass attempt at like a secession movement, at least depending once again about how bad the uh, but bad the economy gets. I did see uh oh boy, I saw Trump. i saw uh Alec Baldwin drink the bleach uh and man i i said this on twitter but um uh you know i when i watch sir night live people say how can you watch it it's because it's fine it's fun uh you know i'm be doing i'm going to be on my phone anyway, why not be on my phone and find out what my friends and said snl are up to, sometimes i'm surprised by a delightful sketch that i wouldn't have seen otherwise, and then think when things are bad they're usually bad in an interesting or broke way, and you're like, wow, they really are fucking this up in a very specific fashion and you can kind of tease it out, it's fun, you can engage with it, never sad, never made me sad, because when i it's a 40-year-old show, but also it was never that good to begin with, it's a lot of it is people suffusing nostalgia for their childhood version of. show that's why they they always are so harsh on the on the on the current program uh so it's like whatever but man these zoom ones the zoom ones are just soul destroying just seeing what like we're willing to put up with already in terms of just cramming all of our anxiety into the most anadine brain dead packaging to just diffuse all sense of urgency or even understanding of ' own life conditions in just like this this teseract of banality, but to do that with everyone in their homes just drawing to how absurd this is, it's like a fucking enesco play, and it's very depressing, it's actually sad, as I said, that like the earnest like kind of like like panic behind the eyes of the performers who are recording these in their homes and doing zoom calls, you can see this glint uh, and it real does feel like it's videos that somebody a terminally ill person would get make for their kids so that they'll remember them by, i was like, hey kids, i'm going to do a for some funny sketches so you can remember me after i'm gone, you know, that's that's the kind of vibe as the kids say that these things have, and it's brutally depressing, kyle mooney stuff is still decent cuuse he's a video got originally, but uh, i mean i'm sure sandberg also would have done well uh in this uh Davidson uh reminding everyone that he is one of the most cosmically talentless creeps to ever appear on the show or in popular culture, i mean i am just baffled that that uh i mean this is also brought on by that mindblowing trailer for his uh movie that looks like no thank you i would rather watch uh the collateral murder video for 90 minutes and that thing holy shit wow and he's and now what he's doing on the on the zoom as analysis he's rapping he's doing like self-written raps about having to stay home with his mom and it's like wow like that's a one where you do feel like things have gotten worse because you know there's like Davidson is the role that has in previous generations of the show been filled by jimmy fallen uh uh Adam sort of like the unique figure who has like a talent uh that's like orthogonal sort of to the snl but also intersecting uh you know and usually has a has a guitar or some sort of musical part of their deal uh and so he's like in that tradition he's a more famous version because he's had famous girlfriend uh and he has like uh you know mental health freokouts in public but uh he's just like the next the latest one of those guys and of those guys he is the least talented, i mean at least fallen who is of course not nearly as talented as Adam sandler was, at least fallen has like a geniality uh, even if it's grading, Davidson just, i wouldn't want to sit next to him on a bus, let alone watch him for 90 minutes, getting creeped out thinking about him, and yeah like fallen also could play a guitar, um, his stuff wasn't as good as Sandlers cuz Sandlers was the originator oh man can you imagine when Tray and Matt get a hold of coronavirus holy crap i mean i can't wait to see it's going to be funny uh let's see what's going to happen stan's dat is going to get really obsessed with uh like a a cam camming or something something about like being inside all the time uh and then uh cartment of... is going to be a militant uh open reopen uh guy uh and then that'll be it, it'll be funny. i already, i already wrote it, it's done, kenny will drink bleach and die, done, yeah there you go, san's daad has holy fan, something like that, zoom messaging, yeah, you you get it already, apparently that's all that's in production in hollywood right now is uh animated shows so if anybody's got a pitch for a sitcom or something they're turning it into an animated version of itself. which means that the the whole thing of animated shows becoming just more you know like literal-minded uh therapy sessions for the writers it's only going to get more explicit so get ready for that that'll be fun. that'l be nice. i do like rick and morty though, i'm saying it's a very clever show, you have to be very intelligent to understand the jokes. uh, and i actually like solar opposites as well, it's like diet, rick and morty, it's like rick and morty with half the calories. yeah, that's the other thing is that like peet davidson because he is like this you know uh, you know... the the the he's like he's basically SNL's version of a soundcloud rapper and his whole vibe is that like zand out nialistic you know on the edge of uh mental hysteria at any moment thing I mean he got a fucking tattoo of Hillary Clinton for god sakes it makes it hard it makes me feel bad for him but at the same time just one of the most least appealing uh people they've ever had on the show I'm trying to think of who else is out there really young Robert Downey Jr as a kid was really horrible. Obamacate guys, it's Obama Gate, man, you guys remember when they were talking about how Obama fucked up the swine flu and how that was way bigger deal than this, and how everyone needs to talk more about the swine flu and how that was the real bungle, I don't hear that anymore, they don't talk about that anymore, which really makes you wonder how far those goal posts are going to move. Ooh, is there a possibility of someone like Caesar or Napoleon rising from the military, especially in case they take over? Oh, boy, that's interesting, that's an interesting question. Uh, I, because I've thought a lot about this, because I thought a lot of what the real counterveiling forces at play here are, because obviously the working class is largely not a player in any of the scenes, the global, the global proletar peasontry or global tar has no real say on anything. In the United States specifically, you've got a political class. that is largely incompetent uh placeholders who are there in the names of corporate interests, some of which are domestic, some international, some all of them at some degree of competition and conflict with one another, but with one general you know uh interest, they share a lot of uh the same interests as the ruling class in uh western Europe uh and also China and Japan uh and they are looking to extract as much money from this thing as possible because they're hiding the engine of capitalism as it just drills out the last bits of ore from the center of the earth and turns it into beebies, so they are riding this thing to the end, that's it, their main interest is whatever they can take from this, and if the whole thing breaks apart, that's fine, because to not break apart would require undermining the the profit engine, which is more important than anything, and that's when you hit the self-destruct button, that's when you get what marks called in the manifesto, the common ruin of the contending classes, which is the end of a unsuccessful uh class war, but the thing is is that the United States also has a state structure, you know, politicians in it don't really have very much power uh or you know popular legitimacy, but there are uh function, deep state functions that have significant like logistical and infrastructural power, one of the biggest one is the us military, i mean there i mean there is a direct connection between you know the impoverishment of the American welfare state relative to Europe and our military budget, I mean those things are connected, the reason that the Europeans built, public housing and and national healthcare services after world war 2 is that we were the ones wh built all the bombs and all the nukes and and and and protected the free world, they were kind of got they got off of that because they had to make sure that their working class wasn't swayed by communism, which was right there. across the iron cart, we didn't have that, and so instead we were the arsenal, we had we had military canenism, all all stimulus basically through military spending, and that has created the world's largest like military infrastructure, the largest military power the world is ever known, and then even if you had like a real breakdown in in systems of control and uh and uh uh infrastructure and logistics networks, they're pretty durable and and uh networks within the... us military that are going to be able to withstand that, and they have highest free to core, unit cohesion, all that stuff, they have they have task and purpose, all that uh, but the thing is they don't have anything like a a like a united commander, like there's no, there is nobody, like because as I've talked about on the show before, that has been there are a bunch of idiots, like we did, we have created a perfect mediocrity out of the fake merit. we have because meritocracy and chris of all people has talked about this well the whole twilight of the elets thing is that overtime meritocracy just reproduces inherited wealth, because the meritocrats to succeed on their own merits, then create conditions so that their kids can do as well or better than or better than them, which means that they because they get all the things, you know, all the all the edges smooth for them, they they they do, and but then they don't have the competence that their parents did because they didn't get there themselves, and then they just do it to the next generation who has even less connection to actual competence, and we're like four or five generations deep into that, I mean, the Trump family is a great example, you got the hards cable gampa comes from Germany and becomes like a uh, what, he owned a bordello and the UK and then get got bought bought real estate in New York like a real like an in Rand hero, then the the sun takes advantage of you, a bunch of government programs to become a uh essentially a a middleman between you know the new deal uh uh state and uh the city of New York. uh just a functionary essentially, and then his son, even less talented, even less involved with directly with making the well, and that's exact same thing has happened in the military, because these guys rised our our military uh uh uh goals are becoming have become over the years so uh confused uh listless uh uh contradictory uh and it's suffused with failure because every mission that they've given has been a failure. I mean, what is our record of the 21st century? It's dog shit, and so West Point and the officer corre reproduces just institutional mediocrity, so this guys at the top, there is, I highly doubt that there is a Napoleon amongst them, uh, I highly doubt that, I mean, maybe at the mid level you'll have some like energetic officers, which was the case, with the free officers movements in the Middle East and in Africa, the question is whether they would be able to coordinate and you know essentially behed. senior uh senior authority uh, but one way or another when they start just really stripping down the social order of everything to take it private to create like a a network of sort of snow crash, libertarian eos oasises, there will be an institutional uh uh interest by the US military separate from capitalism, which it serves broadly to maintain that system. and that will be the point where maybe all of these uh, you know, these these uh social or political structural things, you know, like constitution and that shit, that's maybe when they finally get broken, but I don't know, uh, but then of course there's always the more likely scenario, it seems to me, given America's size, uh, is more of a spiral outward rather than a concentration inward. but once again the big inputs that have to be put in here that haven't been put in yet are how bad the virus is, how able are we able to maintain resilient supply chains, how much are we able to get money into people's hands to restart the economic engine? those are all questions that have yet to be answered. it is as Sean Morhead on Twitter called it. the time in history known generally as the cool zone. when you have a crisis of democratic legitimacy, economic viability and public health intersecting in a uh time of rapidly uh and exponentially increasingly changing the climate, that's the cool so. only cool things happen in times like that, generally from the point of view of reading about them, of course, you know, not necessarily living through, but we'll see. but the thing is like Napoleon you know was able to rise through the military because the revolution happened you know there was an actual class-based rebellion against the anchan regime uh he didn't act first he had to be like his his path to power had to be legitimized by changes in uh you know values one of which replacing uh blood uh right with uh some kind of early version of meritocracy which is the whole idea of... of of bonapartism, bonapartism reproduces the uh um, you know, the hierarchical nature of uh monarchial government, but instead of allowing it to be you know a uh inherited by the the the oldest and you know most soft and unaccomplished people on earth, it is a uh a new and vigorous um, a new and vigorous hierarchy uh where the people have claimed those roles by their intelligence and ability, but of course you can see even here the way that that never is what works, because Napoleon, the fucking avatar of liberal meritocracy, the guy basically invented the... concept you know like the napoleonic codes and his social civic and social reforms were all about abolishing the the society of orders and replacing it with a new hierarchy because it was not non-hierarchical but a new hierarchy based on talent this is this is the ideological underpinning of of of liberal democratic capitalism uh that's what he was he was but what did he do in terms of uh governance not only did he make himself emperor when he conquered other countries made his uh relatives and the high marshals their new monarchs as is like a tribute system seeding a new royalty across Europe that would that would then be meritocratic but the goal there but i believe napoleons thought is there well yes we we deserve it which means if we ever lose it it'll be our fault and i think he just didn't realize how fast and how dramatically that impact can be felt when you're living in connected time that moves at such speed as this one that requires such informational awareness and such speed of action uh and such such basically the opposite of everything we've allowed to accumulate in our gunked up social and political and economic order. I am wondering what happens if RBG dies by November. I kind of think she's might already be dead. I would not be surprised if the uh the uh the the old DNC has playing a little weekend at uh Baiters here uh because you know it's high stake shit uh and they know that I mean my god if she dies before November where is their stick to get anyone to vote for Biden? You know because presumably that would be. I mean if he nominated somebody it would be, it would be approved almost immediately right, like unless it was right before the election, she'd be replaced almost instantly, like they'd steam roller, like uh, McConnell would pull every lever he has to instantly do that, and then wouldn't that kind of undercut the argument for why you need to vote for Biden, because like even now Supreme Court gone. goof gater bater Ginsberg, she is a damn goof, i can't think of another a better example of liberal hubrus than her conviction that she could hang around even though she was in her 80's and beset by maladies during Obama's term because democrats were never going to lose the presidency again, what difference does it make? wow, wow lady, well well then, but as I've said, uh, things like the Supreme Court, if we're going to really change anything, if we're really. going to like not let ourselves get turned into bazos uh uh you know bug creatures by the aftermath of this thing like just get plugged into an actual matrix of human exploitation where we are given the bare substance of soilent and uh and a bare minimum of entertainment visavy shown directly on the inside of our eyelids uh then it's not going to because somebody got became president and nominated a liberal justice to the Supreme Court, or you want a Supreme Court uh case, the Supreme Court is going to be quite secondary to any uh, any situation like that, but it's not necessarily means it's going to be illegitimate process somehow uh, it'll just be a conditions will not allow like for this, the maintenance of the system itself will not allow its constituent parts to maintain their current order. That's a good point about the fundraising, I think theah the RBG shit is really for the uh, for the rubes who cut the checks, man, can you imagine giving money to the democratic party, that ooh the most cucked thing imaginable uh? do you think we will ever pass medicare for all? see that's another one like the court thing where i think we might end up some version of an actual humane healthcare system, i don't think it's going to be because something passes the house and senate, is ratified by the president and then passes muster with a the Supreme Court, uh, i just don't see that happening, but i also don't see that as an as a circumstance that will that's inviable and will never end. I mean one thing that might ease it along is the fact that the fucking healthcare industry it's not this is COVID thing is fucking with it I mean this is. this it's not, they're not just making money off of this thing, it's actually it's and especially if we've just decided we're going to let people die, uh, man, uh, that's going to be a huge told that i don't know if they can deal with all, oh man and nancy. locy, so I've talked about how they fuck this bat so badly that we're all now in a situation where people have just shrugged their shoulders internally and accepted that they're just going to be okay with a lot of people dying and then end up just you know venting all that feeling on each other uh you know in in in violences and uh and and hostilities small and big uh the reason that's happening is because they fucking just dicked around for eight weeks instead of using the time people stayed home to change anything like create any kind of system for contact and trace or maybe create alternative systems for providing food or whatever suspending the economy that kind of stuff suspending rent doing things like that and obviously yeah republicans very bad and everything but like and i'm not even saying democrats because there were democrats who actually had things that would have made a difference and could have been points of argument and points of differentiation. with the republicans and Nancy intentionally refused to allow any of them to appear in any kind of bill that could be voted on up or down, she essentially refused to put anything out and allowed uh McConnell in the senate to write the bills and pass them first, and then she would send the already ratified version to the house, I think her argument probably would be, well since they're not going to pass anything they don't. want to and they have control, then i it's wasting time to do anything other than pass what they've already passed because we're not going to get it through any other way, but of course that ignores the fact that there were real differences out there that could have been a in some way uh exemplified and maybe pressure could have been brought to bear, and there was no pressure for anyone to get their act together because Nancy Pelosi wasn't applying it on purpose because she was too blinkered in her understanding of you know what the... the moment called for uh to actually grasp the what's what was going on and like the reason that there's no that if Trump does somehow lose this election or like loses the support of his of his diehards if if if the massive profundity of this failure that he and it is i mean it's jaw dropping the number of people who he's directly responsible for killing is going to be astronomical by the end of this he's going to be in George W. Bush territory maybe um and maybe we will banish him, but you think Nancy Pelosi if you know she eats enough cored blood and atrinachrome if she keeps running for that seat, do you think they'll ever turf her out in her wealthy uh enclave in San Francisco full with very very high information voters, you can't say that they don't know what's going on, you can't say they're brainwashed by fox news and the and what they're and and they're signing off on it, they think It's fine, they think it's cool, really, really bad stuff. Why pretending that there is something to discuss? Okay, so that's a good question. If you guys know that everything is bullshit and it's all just the oligarchs, then why don't you just talk about that? Well, that's another one of those things where you heighten the degree of abstraction. from like your grasp to the point that it just creates more anxiety and it freaks you out more and worst of all it leaves you really with nothing to say buse what are you supposed to say yes they're trying to they're trying to grind us into fucking paste the they're using this the're using the excuse of this to guarantee that there's no socialist turn in toward uh in the face of disaster which there generally has been uh traditionally the things in history that have led to long-term and significant drops and inequality within within cultures are massive wars that destroy capital in lives, significant weather events that lead to things like serial famin and uh pandemics and disease, i mean the middle ages were turned into the modern era essentially by black death, the black death is the engine of modernity, that's where it started, that's where the accumulated silt of the post-roman order was sort of. out of the carburator uh and I think our global uh bourgeois is aware of that phenomenon and is deadset on using the fact that they have accumulated not only more capital than any other ruling class in history, but more uh powerful capital in the terms of more abstracted and technological capital that can be that could that multiplies their actual force vastly. beyond their number or even their capital uh, their control of capital, and they're thinking, we're going to be the ones to not do that, we're going to be the first ruling class to survive intact with when a the system collapses, and of course this still be, even if they fail at maintaining the system, they will still in some instances succeed, because the the the uh the old the new aristocracy that rose and that rises slowly maturely out of all of these great leveling events, a lot of it has their a lot of them have their origins as uh, powerful, influential, successful families before that, so you know whatever is built from the ashes of what might fall, there's going to be a heavy sprinkling of uh of accumulated wealth from before that's going to form the toppest layer of sediment. Am I disheveled, am I, am I tossed? Am I wind tossed? Am I a storm tossled rogue? and by a storm tossled rogue yes, somebody's asking about like a cromwell rather than a Napoleon. considering the uh religion will be more prevalent as an a as a motivator uh than they was in the last one that's a good point uh and and half the guys in charge of the military who are up there are complete millenniary nut jobs uh i mean they they're all like that dude uh who got fired for mouth and off about how his god was bigger than you know the muslim god and he was going to go over there and and do crusade against them and shit uh so but the thing is those not all of them half of them are like patreus and maccrystal like kind of like they're basically like military joe scarborows they're like worldly kind of economically uh conservative but mostly chill with social issues kind of guys who uh you can convivially hang out with any group of sophisticated because they all they all have graduate degree. you know like they're they're not they're not just uh they're not uh peasant levies you know a lot of them a lot of them go to ivy league schools you know uh so there's this there's actually an internal divide within the readship with the military that mirrors the educational and religious divide in America so uh that's that's a little bit farther down down the path I don't know but it is an interesting x factor to think about. what's the name of that guy? what's the name of that crazy general? boikins? you now, the thing about how James Komey became director the FBI is an interesting question, because he is such a nafe, i mean you you you see what he how he talks about himself, and it is like a cartoon boy scout and you think this has got to be a scam, but then you look at what happened to him. and how he perfectly botched everything and got owned out of government and then had to like become a become an inspirational poster uh a slogan writer that's a that's clearly he botched something you know that was not that makes you think it was from a real place that he really does think that way and so how does somebody like that become in charge of the organization that killed MLK for god sakes uh and I think it just I think in situations like that you just have to assume. that there is another guy or woman in the FBI hierarchy who's like the dark version of komi who does makes the decisions that he doesn't even know have to be made, i don't know who that guy is, but he's probably he's definitely in there, if komi is the guy who appears to be he is, just an absolute goof, am i considered? comparison just because yeah like the idea of a unified coming out of the us military seems less likely than some sort of regional breakdown, i mean when you consider that you know those bases are all spread all over the place, you could have a general jack d ripper situation at any place of a significant size, guy in charge of Pendleton decides to take over California, he probably could, so whoever's in charge of Camp Pendleton could just become like the the the uh grand of California tomorrow if you wanted to, like the fort brag guy could do that to the Carolina coast, and then you've got National Guard, which is the X factor, because those guys have a lot of fucking guns and a lot of shit, and they could be nationalized obviously by the president and are and you are used like for military purposes and overseas, but the command authority there is to the states. oh boy, it's just a very, once again, i think the people who who poo poo this are are are right uh in that it a lot of it is just sort of a uh kind of honestly bad taste wish wishcasting for some kind of you know redemption from this arc of of just the worst but you know us never changing, us allowing things to get worse, but just slowly and slowly worse and never changing anything and just imagining someday there's going to be a wrecking. somehow, it's all going to crack up and we're going to get to see it. uh, you know, there's a certain degree of that that's part of it, and that's why you got to remember that this is all dependent on the economy, basically uh, cratering to a degree that I just don't think is going to happen, uh, I think that there is enough investment at the top level in maintaining for the near term some sort of legitimacy and popular government, uh, that they're gonna they're going to bail us out, basically to the extent they have to, and on their own terms. you know so we're all going to be super surveiled, we're all going to have to watch a a like 30- second ad before we can piss in our own bathrooms uh you know we're all going to work in their tubes and shit we're all going to eat their uh whatever paste that they you know uh sell us uh without asking what it is uh and it'll be more of the same but just more intensified and faster and worse and more brutalizing because we know the human cost that we are all involved with and are all participating in and that's the real growth. part is that when people just start staggering back out pretty soon they're already doing it and the waves of bodies start piling up and we just normalize it, we're all just going to feel like it's own fault and we're going to blame each other, the libs are going to blame the the conservatives who wanted to own everybody by going out in public, uh, the conservatives will blame the chinese, so there'll probably be some sort of like a mini pograms going on at like pf changs and shit in the suber. and it's just because we have we'll have all this feeling of horror and no order to put it because we just refuse to not internalize at a personal or like social level all misery, i mean people talk about uh people talk about terms of the military, what about private contractors? those guys are big deal, it's going to be significant. force, but like right now, I don't think there's a private contractor in the world who can stand toe to toe with like the military. Maybe I'm wrong about that, there could be some capacities I'm unaware of, I would not be surprised if that was the case, but for the most part I think those, I mean those guys uh, those guys who went into Venezuela were fucking uh, were you, defense contractor, they were private military contractors, I keep doing this today, I'm doing the finger quotes, I remember the... where uh Chris Farley he would do him so fast that he flew, but it broke because he was fat, it was a good one. That's what he said, he goes, I'm fat, I'm sorry guys, is everything worse 25 years, worse than 25 years ago just feel that way, I think it honestly is, just because we're 25 years closer to you know resource capacity hitting environmental feedback. and all that, you know, and we have not really made a lot of progress except in a negative way, becoming more socially atomized, more alienated from each other and from labor uh, and less though conscious of it enable to organize against it, which is what's not supposed to happen in in marxism, that's the one thing that's not supposed to happen is that increased misery is supposed to directly lead to corresponding working class solidarity and and uh mobilizing, and that has that doesn't happen. because this we've been we've been overly symbolized, we got over symboled, we created a level of abstraction in politics and in culture that just and we had a a degree of wealth to distribute uh uh uh in to kind of buy off working class uh anger and and put all of that see because the the opening of markets around the world gave uh like the western uh proletariat uh an offer that the working class wasn't supposed to get in traditional marxism uh i think marx kind of understood this could happen but you know he didn't see it happen as much lenin talked more about it uh you can provide some uh, some relinquishment of the of the conditions of of pain and suffering uh by giving more money, giving more recognition to unions and more union control, because you're able to pass off that exploitation to other workers elsewhere, and that doesn't fuck with profit, and as a result of that comp those twin motions, the culture becoming. acted and and uh essentially diffusing Americans social consciousness, you want to call it spirit, whatever you want to call it, like like that sense of emptiness that we all know to be the modern condition, it accelerated with that that that wealth that we have because of the free real estate, because of the free refills, because of the tradition specific nature of of capital accumulation in America where all all internal crises could be resolved through. uh and now we've reached a point where those inputs are gone, so now as i said the garage is filling with carbon monoxide, but we have not had uh, but nothing has reversed the social trend, in fact the social trend has only been vastly uh exacerbated. by technology and by the internet and by the culture that it creates and now we have it replicated in the physical space by separation through quarantine, it's it's like every every pathology is reinforcing in a different level and then pushing down and reinforcing on one another, but as I said that pressure is going to create change and we just have to be ready when change. begins because this is the fluid motion, right now we are uh, yeah, we're at that stage in a earthquake when the friction is so intense that the ground actually liquifies, it becomes essentially a liquid, uh, and that's where we are right now, we're in the liquid state, and that is why because we don't. the source of our pain and stuff and because we have so thoroughly had that you know pain identified with quenching through consumption uh there's going to be a lot of anger as as people are uh not given those things as as their degree of access to material pleasures is reduced and there's no spirit, there's nothing spiritual to fill the vacuum, there's no sense of meaning to fill the vacuum, it's just purely hollowed out. but that's our task I guess while we whatever we can find whatever way we can rebuild social ties I guess at any level so like if people ask like what's the next step of the grill pilll after you know refocusing on the world around you uh I don't know the answer but the question should be what can I do to rebuild anything like a social network a social a sense of social trust uh at the people around me how can we how can I re fill that fucking hollowed out chocolate easter bunny with creamy caramel meaning and and it starts with creating a sense of uh of uh of communal benefit, the idea that you get something by cooperating with your people other people that trusting people instead of approaching everyone with the the hunched flinching snarl of the uh of like the reactionary gun actually has a benefit, it makes you more relaxed, it makes you feel like you have people can help you in a problem, and that only that sense is going to get people able to rise to the challenge, they're going to have to believe in it, and i don't know what that means, i'm sorry, i can't say anymore, because everything is so wildly fluid, but when the ground starts settling, you got to look around you. We're gonna have to, we're all gonna have to start looking around ours, around us and any greed that we can do that now, we should also do. Oh god, love yourself and everyone around you, god damn it, I guess that's it now, Jesus, what a difference of a couple of years make, huh? couple of years, uh, failed presidential race, global uh, fucking pandemic that's gonna rearrange the face of uh civilization and some level, even if nothing changes in the current moment. so yes, love yourself, love everyone around you. uh, Biden dropping out, I think might very well happen after the nomination, because I looked it up, and apparently if anybody with draws after being nominated, but before the election, the DNC meets to replace them, the way. they replaced Terry Eagleton with Sergeant Schriver in 1972. What that means is Biden the day after the the uh hell the hour after uh the convention nomination he could say oh oh I'm sick or I want to spend time with Dr. Joe Biden and then they can put in anyone they want. They don't have to do any redue of any sorry votes from the uh the convention delegates it's just DNC members. or some grouping within there, so yeah, I think that's a very realistic way that could happen, especially since as I've said, it doesn't really matter what Biden wants here, because he has no independent base of support in the party, he's borrowing obamas, because Obama couldn't be on the ballot, and that means that if Obama makes the same uh recognition of reality that he made before Super Tuesday, which was if I don't get off my butt, we're going to fucking eat. shit in something that we could win, like if like I've said, if Trump looked unbeatable if we were sitting still sitting at like one and a half% unemployment and and uh the media was all culture war hore shit uh and then the the DNC just blew themselves up to nominate Biden, I can see them saying fuck it, let him take the fall so we're all hands clean and win the next one, let fund raise off Trump for four more years. but they really see that they could get it this time, but it's not going to be with Biden, but they can't do it now because it's too uh, it's doing the air, which the problem is it's a long ass time till what august, that's a long time, that's a long, that's a whole summer that they got to keep him, not, I mean, they don't have to take him out much, but they have to keep him in people's public eye, he has to be an actual, you know, alternative to Trump for people even if they hate Trump. to want to go out and vote for him, the most boring uh ending to the virus, yes, but also honestly I think in the medium term the most destabilizing, because the most boring conclusion is is high six figures, maybe millions dead and that being normalized, and I don't think you can just metabolize that without any ill effect. "I think it will have significant social pressure, especially as the recovery to this economic collapse it's still in the process will be will make 2008's recovery uh look like you know the recovery after black friday or black Monday or something and in a situation like that all that death is going to have an effect even if in the short term it's just oh yep more the same but worse." unless of course not as many people die as we're all thinking, but considering how many are already dead, I don't think that's realistic. I mean, we're almost we're almost the six figures already. I don't think there's a way we're not talking about nearly a million. So we're gonna have to really like look at each other and say what we're what we're capable of allowing and uh it's gonna be it's not going to be pretty. Whoever they replace biting with is another question though, because that's person that has to have juice in the party because you can't just put in anybody there, unless they don't have any unless they have no independent power base and they're no threats so like a total a total uh empty suit. that you have to have total trust wouldn't be able to actually exercise power. I don't know who that would be, maybe Corey Bocker, uh, but not famous enough, they've got to have Mondo name recognition, and that is why the people say Hillary Clinton. hilariously are you know that's my that's the funny answer that is kind of isn't that honestly the funniest thing that could happen uh and so i i honestly cuz who else is this famous to trying to build up kuomo but honestly man i don't know how you pull that one when you it's the epicenter of not only infections but deaths basically in the world uh nusum i don't know if he's going to be able to get famous enough in the next few months especially since there really is an east coast biased and media and being in California does just doesn't give him the the attention that uh being on east coast time does, which is what gave Koomo that pump in the first place, even though he's went one of the most incompetent idiots to even come close to this fucking thing, one of the worst guys, and he's in the high 80s, maybe they will just do it, maybe they'll overlook it, maybe the fact that they're all that he killed all those people isn't going to matter because to the same way that the maga people will just say, well now that's because of china or because because of the governors, or because of uh Peter Strosik and the lovely, lovely nelly or uh, and liberals are say it's because of Trump, they'll say yeah, oh yeah, but he couldn't have done anything differently, could happen, but even then I wonder about kwomo, he does seem like a clinton, he's in the Clinton orbit right, so he's a little St. James Democrat as they call him. I hope if there is a historical record of this period of American history that you know how there are different factions of different political parties in history, there were the burbin democrats were sort of the reactionary uh uh southerners uh who couldn't who had to be democrats because you know there was only one party there uh they could be the uh they could... be the little, they could be the little St. James Democrats, Bernie was defeated in 2016 by a coalition of little St. James Democrats, so uh if Koomo uh, if Koomo is in there then that's probably another victory for uh for the little St. James, little St. James Ecrats. I mean working councils, I hope so, I hope we can get people to uh work at the level of uh their job, problem is, I mean, the thing to remember is that even in the great depression, there was still massive amounts of labor militancy, even with so many people out of work, so the traditions have been lost in a lot of ways, but the dynamic isn't inherently doomed, uh, there are if things get bad enough i could honestly see this whole culture war thing really it could either explode or the bubble could burst if things get bad enough and people get it a workplace level it could, but we got to be in the position to make it happen if those conditions arise, it's just i hate, i like coming on and talking to you guys, but thing that just really uh but like i i i always en feeling like we're just have to come back to just how unstable and everything is and how unheardd it is to know what's going on and i know that that's just feels so unsatisfying to sit with but i think we all have to sit with it where the way we're sitting with anything else we have to just sit with our are with things moving in slow motion you can kind of see where you are. in relation to things closer, so i guess you just got to keep your eyes feeled, pay attention to stuff, not arguments on twitter hopefully, but you know situations as they develop, i don't know, we're all just throwing spaghetti at the wall here, just trying to see what sticks, just trying to vibe our way through the our lives on this crazy spinning blue ball. somebody wants me to tell them how to help murder and threaten oligarchs? uh, no, thank you, officer, uh, I'm not going to be discussing that today, I'm simply doing my twitch stream, I'd be appreciated if you please be on your way unless you have a warren or something. Felix's idea of the pristers as the bonaparts, well of course they have to be from Illinoi our provincial boy will simply not allow... the the next great dynasty not to arise from that ridiculous shard of uh flatland. I mean, we'll see how JP isn't really. asserting himself, i mean people say he's doing okay, but i'm not hearing a lot about him, so uh, you know, get your shit together. what is my take on the the flim charges being dropped? uh, i mean it's probably because they pulled strings because they've been pulling the fuck out of a bunch of strings uh, but also because a lot of this whole thing was bullshit, i mean come on man, We all know at some level that like a lot of the Russia Gate stuff was just made up or like a game of telephone because the whole thing prem was hinged on something that was never proven in any way that there was a direct connection between Trump at the highest at the level of the candidate and and Russia in any meaningful way. But also yeah of course they put their finger on the scale. I just hope we stop talking about all that shit forever. I really do, I really hope we could just internalize what a failure that was, I hope some of the people who like spent any time on it can maybe think for a minute of how wasted that time was, everyone who is proud of the fact that they know lev parnis, everyoneho yelled at Virgil about how he was too disrespectful to the idea of lev parnis, I want them to be right now, I want to find out every one of them and I want to ask them, do you know who lov parnis is and see how many of them still remember? they probably all cheat by googling, but i bet a lot of them if you said left parness to them now, they wouldn't know the fuck you're talking about, and that was like four months ago, lev parnis dies of coronavirus, no one's going to know who that was, including the libs. How have you avoided being misanthropic and cynical? I think the best way to avoid misanthropy is to is to remember as I've said that everyone is where they are for reasons outside of their control. They have choice, you know, and they chose to do the things they did, but the options they were presented were not theirs and so that should that's just to like drain my feelings about them from with Venom, but if they're doing bad and they're e they should be opposed, but because their their condition is uh provisional, that means everyone's is, which means people can be better, i really think that, and i think the proof is in the putting in terms of human history, you know, we would have destroyed ourselves already, you know, think of those russian uh, think of like the three different Russian military officers. who could have ended all life on earth during the cold war and shows not to, not even knowing really that they weren't dooming their own country to nuclear oblivion, the guy who didn't fire on the uh blocade ships uh in the cuban missile crisis and of course the guy who uh didn't sign off on a nuclear strike when the the blips came over over the radi radar, he guess no that's probably not there. and even though everything told him he should, he didn't, and those systems were all designed to be fail safe, they assumed that given these conditions the person will do x, and they were designed that way, and yet when that came that moment came, these guys said no, and that means that at some level, I think we can all say no, and the task before everybody. right now is to figure out where that where they can start. all right guys, that was a good time i thought, had fun, sorry if i was spacy uh, i haven't eaten yet, got to eat a little bit, but i have dinner, i'll talk to you guys tomorrow, bye-bye.
