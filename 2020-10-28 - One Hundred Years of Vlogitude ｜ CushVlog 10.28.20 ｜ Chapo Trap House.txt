 Okay, there it is, what is the great commotion, motion, motion, all the countries though, is the ball. rolling on for typical new and tyler to and with him will be a little van is he used up man and with him will be the little van am I on again what did was I on and then dropped off or uh was I never on before this I couldn't so was there like an interruption or did it just not go on until now I don't understand how the bullshit works. I was never really here shit all right well here's my voting ball I got today when I went to vote when I went to my early voting place which lucky me was the Barkley center uh and I was able to walk up today I'd seen lines in previous days but today no line strolled in uh got the deal it works it took me five minutes. uh, and if you want to know who I'm voting for, who I voted for, I'll just say that for a long time I resisted the demand of people that I put, you know, my country first and future generations of this planet, sacrifice my lofty ideals in favor of the practical need to defeat uh, rising fascism, and I i admit that I've resisted for a long time, but I finally come around to the wisdom of it. I'm finally ready for her and so today I voted for Hillary Clinton and I believe that uh that her defeat has humbled her and I think now she's ready to come and uh and clean up Washington I think she needed a loss before she could really uh understand you know what the stakes and and uh what she really wanted you know like she took it for she took it for granted and now after having lost it she'll never take it for granted. again, which is why I think she'll govern wisely and and justly, so and so if anyone, yeah, you can't get mad at me, I voted for Hillary, uh, I actually wrote in everything because I did not have a very interesting contested ballot, there wasn't even anything at the local level that I could putitively influence the results of so I went nuts, I I think I voted for myself for Congress uh, real fun was in the judges, i had to vote for all these supreme court justices, most of whom were running on opposed, so i got to write in some fun people there like judge reinhold, judge doom, so as usual, i enjoy the experience, i enjoyed getting my ballot, i enjoyed filling in the little bubbles and most of all i love sliding it into the machine and going a little boop and then get a little guy and hey i even got a stress ball here it says don't stress, vote early uh, don't know why you would give that to somebody when they were already doing it, but i guess the idea is they bring it out there and maybe gets thrown in a waste of dump and someone picks it up and remembers to do so, so the Supreme Court recently ruled that the that states will be able to suspend - the the counting of mail in ballots after the election uh, because they will be by according to cavanaw prima fasha in uh illegitimate because they will flip the result of the of the race in that state. that is, i think i people pointed this out, insane what he is saying there, there is no legal or constitutional basis for that, states have five. weeks to register or to certify the results, there's nothing in any law saying anything has to be announced the night of the election, that's never been true, what he's talking about is tv, the fact that we have the media to do projections and take early returns and exitpolls and make make like journalistic guesses that we because they're pretty you know well hedged and they wait long enough take his gospel and then are confirmed later by the actual vote count, but if you're a cranky old man watching me no, you know to know who who won on the night, and that's not a standard, it's insane to expect, oh to say that legitimacy of the election matter is because grumpy, confused, old senile fox news. like the president uh are too angry uh and and too confused by the prospect of them not announcing the the winner on the night up like there is no way that you can argue that that that's a reasonable standard for undermining legitimacy of an election unless you think the entire country or those who count anyway are fox newing fox news watching demented old people and of course this tells us that if this does come down to a Trump versus Biden uh styled court case that they will figure, they will find a way, no matter how ludicrous the basis, to invalidate the votes necessary in the states necessary for trap to win. I don't think anyone will will should uh have any illusions about that, there will not be some moment when all those Supreme Court justices stand up and say, no sir, the the honor of our institution will not allow us to go along with this blatant theft, they've already laid the ground work, they're going to they already they did the thing that uh even the... wrote Bush versus Gore said, don't do, which is site Bush versus Gor, because it was just an extraordinary moment where their parties and leanings took over and they said, look, we don't even want to bother creating sustainable legal theory around this, we just want the result, and that'll be it again, and the response I think from liberals to this ruling has been very interesting, and it's one of those things where you see in the small bore how they might have a point. and why they act like this, but then you see how their small boore thinking inevitably sabotages them in the long run, so the response has been, okay, now that we know that if anything is if anything's in the mail on election day, it's probably not going to be accounted, because that's now the precedent according to the Supreme Court, uh, which is legitimate, um, that means it's your responsibility to get those votes in early. do it now, and I understand the argument that well, hey, nothing's going to change this, you want to be able to you, adapt to the situation, but what you're doing when you're doing that is you're also setting up the situation perfectly after the election is stolen, where, it's really all of our fault isn't it, the same way it became nator voters fault that they stole the 2000 election, it'll be people's fault for not voting early enough, even though now we knew you were supposed to, the same way that the fact that uh presidents have been elected, the last president was elected with less with negative 3 million vote lead, well hey, you know, that's these uh, that's the the system and you need to plan for that, so hey, they're not going to count your late votes, so you need to plan for that, it means it'll always be our fault, it'll always be the fault of the electorate, it'll never be a systemic uh uh rejection of democratic uh input. but i mean these guys are freaking out about some sort of judicial cou, we already had one and they blamed the third party vote for it, they blamed susan. for it, okay? what more do you need? well, somebody says it's amazing how much faith uh livs put in the system that keeps fucking them over. the thing is for the most articulate media libs and the people they represent demographically, it that the system doesn't fuck them over, the system rewards them, they do well under the system, but doing well under the system offends the liberal sensibility. and bourgeois senses of uh of manners and values that they've absorbed to be part of the people who are doing well by this current regime, and so they need a political expression of that discomfort, which is democratic politics, but that's not designed to do anything to the system itself, because it's not hurting them, it's in fact the thing that sustains them, they merely want an expression of uh uh disappointment and angst, a way to feel the discomfort uh, but well... with relieving a personal relationship to that discomfort, it's not because I am an extractor or I am in any way uh advantage by the system, it is that the the the racism or like the constitution or or Fox News is is lead weight around our nation and prevents us from uh from being fully democratic. Oh well, at least I'm aware of it, and I'll vote accordingly to help other people. and so when I say that they're setting themselves up for failure down the road, not for them, continued success, and and and uh thriving within the system, but for the people. who takes from them, the the masses of regular voters who've internalized the logic of the liberal uh of of the democratic party to the point of um psychic you know fusion. Bernie should not go in the cabinet, I'd say that. For one thing, Bernie is not an administrator anyway, I mean at least with Elizabeth Warren you have that. pathetic thing about how she's miss plans and miss details and you know maybe that's right put her she probably does belong certainly not a politician she should be some sort of regulator at best you know it's just a cogna machine designed to like look over balance sheets and find out when two you know there's too much uh fraternizing going on between corporate entities let her do that but Bernie's not a fucking uh administrator i mean i was mayor of uh burlington but i 30 years ago but i don't ' if that's relevant really, also he would then be part of a regime that is going to be hostile to the left and day one, and so he will only serve as a mechanism to deflect anger towards what is going to be a wildly reactionary regime that is going to declare war on the working people of this fucking country, and he's going to be no matter what, no matter how much old, yes, but look what he's he's stacking. you now the the the um the NLR what I don't even know what the fucking labor department could do honestly whatever it is whatever flurry of regulations he imposes it's going to be nothing compared to the larger battle over the future legitimacy of the Democratic party because he's going to be part of that regime but that's i don't think it's going to end up mattering because I don't think he's going to get one man if Chile does uh revive. sim, that'd be so funny, they're not going to revive uh, it'd be funny if they recreated cybersen and then cyber sin brought iende back to life, that'd be funny, no, probably not going to happen, what about bukaren? somebody's talking about bukaren, don't we love buukaren folks? i'm kind of uh, i'm kind of thinking that baccarin might be a little underrated honestly. like he probably had the right theoretical position visa vreslatovsk and then collectivization. it's often described as like a whipsawing from the left to the right, but um, i mean it was a recognition of the of the fundamental weakness of the of the Russia as a potential place for socialism to be born because of the fundamental weakness of capitalism, which they all recognized as marxists. is necessary for the building of um socialism and basically just because they were in a position to win in a contest with the state because of the state's collapsing legitimacy and authority uh they basically made a postthock rationalization around Trotski's permanent revolution idea to say we'll kickstart a revolution and that'll do it and that meant that when it got to the point of ending the war Bucarren said "we need, we're going to need Europe for this, we're not going to do it, so we have to turn this into a revolutionary war, because I mean as soon as Bresel Toff happen, then what was this, what what did Russia do? sat and waited with baited breath for Germany to have a revolution, and they failed to do it, what if they german communists have been able to meet up with some sort of you know pressure anyway, like might not have worked, and it wouldn't have worked for one reason that Lenin recognized." the fucking Russian people wanted the war to end, that's why they have any legitimacy to the bulshevics and what Bukarin took from that is, oh right, we're a giant nation of fucking peasants, what are we going to do, we're going to have to climb down now, and if that means implementing capitalism again, at least we're doing it, and I know it was, I mean it was so horrifying that nobody else could even conceive of it, even though the alternative, what they ended up doing, is the only other thing that could have happened, they were either going to climb back down and negotiate a deal with the peasants to to compensate them for their surplus uh in order to maintain and expand uh industrialization and and urban life, they were either going to pay him for it, which would have revolved bringing back capitalism, or they were going to take it, and but karn seem to be the only person to recognize. except for of course Stalin who didn't carry the way, he just wanted power, and Tratski who essentially went crazy because he couldn't accept the reality of the choice put before him. It doesn't mean the October revolution was a mistake, they needed to to revolt when they did, it would either have been the bolshevics or some sort of military rule and probably like an anti-semitic pogram wave unlike anything we'd seen before, like an industrialized protoholocaust, uh, no, they were right to revell when they did and they needed to win, but every question after that is in the context of what happened then, what happens with the end of world war 1, what happens with the war with Poland when that happens, what happens in Germany, at every point decisions have to be made by people then, something isn't a mistake one way or the other, because it's always contextualized, and it's uh, if it's a mistake or not, it boils down to like the options before you, and in 1918, 19. 17 there was no other option but revolution uh, but then options change as the conditions change, and I mean you know it can't, there has to been something wrong at some point right with the Soviet Union, or else it still be here, and if the answer to that is no, it's because they were choked by capitalism, well I'm sorry, that means it never would have won. like it had to have been a combination of the decisions and actions of the of the people who were in power in the Soviet Union and that was in the capitalist world, it was an interplay of those two sets of decisions and actions, there had to have been mistakes on both on on the side of the soviets, I did read Lincoln in the bardo, it's great, I got to read it again actually, I feel... like i get more out of it now, i own it, i should definitely, yeah, i should read it again, thank you for the wreck, karansky was wildly cringe, uh, his entire approach to holding the war effort together and the provisional government together in the face of just absolute collapsing authority was just to cry, cry all the time, have big emotional, weepy speaches. and just hope that everybody was too got too embarrassed for him to kick him out of power, it was uh yeah wildly very one of the cringier characters in uh in 20th century history. He had to keep fighting the war because at that point the war war was the raise on dettra of the provisional government of of the non-communist faction in uh in power. but when it comes to buse people should uh just to get back to the thing about uh cavinon that ruling, that should tell you all you need to know about what will happen on election on the weeks after election night if there gets to be a jumpball florida type situation they will definitely rule for Trump no matter what and it'll work out fines will get mad there'll probably be another woman's march but that'll be it because who's going to the streets for joe fucking biten especially if it winds its way through a court uh system. in a court uh process that as it goes along cools everyone's arter, just the blade the hissing blade sunk into the uh the the water, like think about what happened with the with the barret nomination, all that shit about we will burn dc to the ground if they try to fill RBG spot, that was a threat, but uh, it's diffused every moment after it's made that the conditions. and if there's a process that leads you towards a conclusion and you accept broadly the legitimacy of those of those processes, even if you disagree with the outcomes, you will by the time the decisive moment occurs be fully disarmed and demoralized, so that's what's going to happen if that occurs, my thing is, i don't think it's going to be that close, i have decided that you can only uh cyke yourself up too much, psych yourself out too much uh, because here's the thing about the polling deal and how pollings does doesn't work anymore, poles have been basically as good as they ever were before and after. 2016 and since in non-presidential races, i think that the specific confluence of insanely unlikely events that occurred in the 2016 election, which included i think a lot of people probably lying about whether or not they were going to vote for Trump because they were embarrassed by it, which was a real thing I think in 2016. The thing is, I don't think that's a thing anymore, because everybody who did that has either gotten on the train now. and there's part of the Trump base who says fuck you lives and gets off on upsetting people, or they're that cadier of uh college-educated white suburbanites who all the data seems to indicate in the last two years, four years have shifted dramatically to the democrats, that those people probably are just voting Biden now, they're not lying anymore if you call them and say they're voting for a democrat, so I think it's going to be not. not close enough for Shananigan simply because it's going to be so many states that you'd have to uh do it in, and the configuration of powers is different in each state, the ability of these guys to coordinate is I think totally unestablished, and most importantly, if you're a members of the Republican Party and you're not directly tied to the trunk machine, part of you would be very relieved to see him go, I think and to be able to deal with Biden, fund raise off of a democratic president, obstruct him at every level. uh, prevent them from doing anything that you don't want them to do, and hey, maybe bully them into doing some sort of a big uh bipartisan uh uh uh bipartisan uh entitlements cut that is that means republicans are no longer the party of austerity because democrats just did it too, like both the both the knife is bloody from both of them and and Biden will be president when it happens so it'll be totally you know uh branded as a at least by partis and maybe democratic proposal, that's great, you're you're you're fine, risking anything for him at that point when there's no direct pressure on you, that's the important thing here, like if it's up to a few uh like uh senators or something, the pressure of the Trump base over their political future will be enough probably to make them do what they're what they're scared to do, what they're scared not to do, but when you're talking about dozens and hundreds of of of of judges and state. legislators all over the country, none of whom individually are going to get blamed if Trump loses, because the republicans i mean they're not going to turn, they're going to get mad at the democrats were stealing it, which because they understand where their enemy is, like confused liberals, like when the election of 2000 was legitimately stolen, as such a thing can be, and who do liberals blame by and large third party voters, the two? the election of 2008 was by all measures a relatively faired free election in this country without any theft at all, and republicans not only think that it was uh illegitimate, they blamed democrats for stealing it. they're gonna they're going to blame democrats, they're not going to blame their legislators, especially if they legislators are able to pull off the relatively easy act of looking outraged at the outcome, but not actually revealing what power they would have had hypothetically to intervene on. half of Trump and everybody just, it's like he's doing a trust fall and everybody's hands just go away, I think that makes sense given where we are. Oh uh, I need to commemorate this uh, before I went on, Chris told me, and I would not have known otherwise, that this is my hundredth kush vlog, I have spit over 100 hours of gibbrish into the internet now, uh, feels like time well spent, got to say, more than most of my time on this planet has been, so that's cool, one hundo, nice round number, pew. and if you've watched all of them uh, wow, I hope, I hope it has uh been in some way helpful, they're not all winners though, of course. So we're going to do an election night. show from our office where I've recorded with Chris some of the vlogs here next Tuesday, it's going to be uh and a minimum, I believe me and Felix, uh, Chris, and I think uh, Virgil in the studio and uh, special guests a plenty, I think Amber is going to call in, uh, and we'll have other people, Adam Friedland might be in the building, it's going to... fun and it's going to be interesting too, because we're not going to be able to organize it around a climactic moment of uh truth, because we'll likely end without knowing, although I do think that Florida will be the bellweather um, because Florida vote uh counts their mail and ballots ahead of time, which means that they will have earlier, faster and more complete results than a lot of the other swing states, and that is... the state where it's sort of a microcosm for the pulling in general, it's shown a solid, consistent uh, biten lead, but at the same time you look at it and you think it's Florida though, and then you'll get some you'll get a few polles where oh what, it's like within a point or something, oh my god, and then you got the fact that yeah, they've got their felony disenfranchisement still in effect, and they're uh going to challenge a ton of uh, are mailing ballots, but but so I think if it looks like Florida certainly Florida is uh is called for Biden on Election night, I think you might be able to just uh lean back if you're if you care about the result uh if you're terrified of Biden of a of a Trump term and find sous in the idea of of a Biden presidency uh I I guess I envi you that a little bit bause for me, i just, i guess i do want biden to win simply from aesthetically, i'm sick of talking about Trump, i feel like there's not really much more going on there, his ability to uh accelerate us towards something, i think is pretty much, his useful ability to accelerates towards anything has been uh uh kind of spent, i feel like he is, also i just kind of feel like he isn't the man for the moment, i feel like to preside over the kind of sustain collapse. and then like reorder of the of uh of the economy like away from um small business ownership uh and employment by an employer towards this entirely decentralitized gig economy where everybody is some is is working for some you know a company that fronts them uh capital and which nobody will have except. for a few of the big corporations in exchange uh for them to basically turn into digital sharecroppers and that's going to suck and you don't want a guy in there banging the dinner bell and screaming all day and trying to edge people towards political conflict, you want a guy up there just with a rictus of of grief just saying, i'm sorry, i know, i know it's terrible, isn't it? i know, i know, oh, i i feel the pain, we weep together as a nation, that's to me that's what uh the system wants, Trump will not be prosecuted, they're not going to start, they're not going to break the understanding, the unwritten rule that nobody is responsible for anything they do in power, because as soon as that's broken, then all of a sudden uh the matrix of decision making of our leadership would be destroyed, like impunity is built into being in power, it is assume condition that undergirdds all of the other decisions you make, because the question of what if people kind out, what if this, it can go to the level of oh, i might get in trouble, oh i might lose my job, oh, but it'll never get to the level of oh, i might go to jail for this, they don't think that way, thinking that way would could specif could actually change the way they govern, they don't want to do that, they don't want to tie their own hands, so nope. but if they call Florida, I think uh, I think Biden's going to win the whole shabang in like as in every state where it looks close, like if they win, if Florida is called on on election night, he might win Texas, he'll probably, I would say, if Florida goes to him, he will definitely win Georgia, probably uh, definitely win Arizona rather, probably win Georgia and is 50/50 for Texas, uh, and that means he definitely wins North Carolina, and what goes about saying, he gets back the entire. uh uh great lakes firewall and i think that would be around 400 electoral votes, he would win Iowa in that content. text i think too, in fact i think he might win Iowa anyway, the one that I think it would be kind of funny if he didn't win is Ohio, which I honestly think see could see happening, I could see him win Florida, Georgia, Texas and Arizona and lose Ohio, just because of the way the demographics have changed there in the last uh eight years, but he could, I think he'll win Iowa either way, Iowa, Iowa is a state that has been hit hard, by specific Trump policies uh in terms of the trade war that has uh hurt the price of corn very badly uh and then of course the horrible response to the tornado apocalypse that they had he's uh he's taking a actual hit from that uh and Jody Ernst also looks very bad there but of course if uh I would say this if Florida is too close to call at the end of the night. I think you're still looking at a biden victory probably, but if it's called for Trump, now you got to raise some eyebrows and think these things might not might be close enough that a tip ball could situation could emerge, in which case referee Tim Doni is going to come out, and I think we all know what the outcome is going to be at that point, and I hope you've already placed your bets beforehand. Apparently uh Biden's looking bad in Nevada and it'd be very interesting if he won'. Arizona and loss Nevada, apparently the uh the early voting situation in uh Nevada isn't great for democrats, they're not getting back the kind of numbers that they were looking like, they needed to to match the 2016 results, so who knows? shift uh latino shift towards Trump seems real, which of course that's makes people apoplectic because what about the cages, what about the the babies at the border? we're americans, the people you're talking about. are americans, that means that even though they're Latino, they're still Americans, which means that their understanding of themselves in a race is very much contingent on a million other ways that they understand themselves, and in America there's a huge cultural vortex towards being a guy who doesn't give a fuck about anybody else, because that's the only way that you can fucking live in this fucking country without going insane, and so it's a very persuasive political violence, and Trump embodies it for people of all of all religions. races and all this stuff, the difference is the way you experience race in this country is going to uh color how you take Trump in, like he's also gaining among apparently black men, not as much nearly as with uh Latinos, but still a shift, and why? because buse the appeal is is a transcendent of race, and the way you experience race can be very much put on a scale with a bunch of other identities and found to be by you less persuasive. to direct you towards something, which is why all the standpoint epistemology that undergirds so much identity politics and uh like theories of um like uh both understanding political reality and formulating practice uh is hollow and and insane because there is no totalized racial experience that overgirds every other part of a person's identity and decision-making matrix and so you cannot use that to determine the right and a wrongness of someone's fucking political beliefs, because people specifically talk about like Trump's horrible stuff with immigration, uh, during the last debate Trump kept saying about immigration to biden, who built the cages and a lot of people were baffled by that because they said you you can't say that when you're the one using them, and no, you can, depending on what premise you're operating from. liberal premise is that this is a horrible thing, that these are monstrous violations of human rights and that we need to stop them. the trump undergird argument that a lot of people agree with regardless of race, is look, we got to have immigration laws, that means you're going to have cages because people are going to come and you can't trust them, so what are you going to do with them? you can't trust them. so you have to keep them in jail, and how do I know that that's true because even Obama, Mr. Winy Winy, heart, heartbreak, makes crying about uh immigrants, had them and built them and put people in them because we're going to put people in them, and the question is, do we accept that it's necessary or do we pretend to be sad about it, because we're literally just virtue signaling to each other, and that's a persuasive argument to people, and there's no challenge to it from the liberals, there's only a further uh, fake orchestra of of of pathos that if you think about it and think you guys built the cages, you put kids in cages too, makes you realize, well this is bullshit, but he doesn't really care, he's not really sad about this, you guys don't. aren't really, you're just using it as a weapon of convenience against republicans, because that's all it actually matters, and that's and therefore there's no content to any of our political ideology, and it's merely a war of of sides and position, and the thing is is that's true because they are not, they are not on other sides, it's a inter uh, it's it's an internal conflict within capitalism about like the best way to uh, like the the... the degree to which you have to soothe your conscience in the pursuit of the total market domination of the planet, and that's i mean that's another expression, that's the way that it's perceived up politically, but that's an expression of a greater tactical question of how much can we squeeze the peasants before this thing breaks down and we don't have any system at all, we get that thing that marks called the common ruin of the contending classes, and that's the basic tactical or strategic argument between liberals and and conservatives about these kind of things, but uh, it's expressed politically as a moral question, but it's all just imperial management, we the border regime is a part of that, it's not going anywhere, neither party is interested in get having it go anywhere, there's no policies that are going to be pursued that are going to make it go nowhere, that means you need things like interdiction and you're going to have to house people, especially if things keep getting bad in other parts of the world. those parts that are convenient for us, closer to the equator, more likely to get hot and uninhabitable and flooded than us, and they're going to have to go somewhere, they cannot come here under the current regime, they're not assimulatable, even the liberals understand that bause what did Obama do, he it deported a bunch of people and he built the fucking cages, and that's what o biden will do, and they know that, and there's no liberal counter argument to it, except to further undermine your moral, moral case, which you think is so unimpeachable, by highlighting its essential hypocrisy and mercenary uh use. buse the greater bet that the conservatives are making is that uh or the ones in power like the ones directing pressing like the accelerator button on here the ones that say no like the mitch McConnell types brick on the accelerator are doing so because they think there's nothing else to be gained by prolonging the fiction of in the face of falling profits and rising uh ecological and uh uh instability. we there's enough momentum in the system for us to loot it while it's while it is still extent and be confident that we can uh if we have to uh negotiate exits individually and privately and the thing is they might not be wrong. I think they really, I got to think about it more, I don't i think that like any in america. Anyway we're we're like the reserve currency and we're in charge of like the institutions of global finance and we're we're the like the ref we're the referees of the global financial system there needs to I think that there that one element of um uh like a successful left um uh immigration policy would be a recognition that a big part of it is going to have to be helping people uh stay in the... countries that they live in, because that's where people want to live, and the reason they can't live there is because their countries are largely being destroyed on purpose by us, and the thing about that though is that you know, you it's a frame that is xenophobic in a way, like this is keeps them out of here, but in practice it's actually the hardest thing you can do, which is get people, if it would work is to get people on board with spending money outside of the United States, which they hate doing, they hate it, there's a reason that people think that uh foreign aid is like 25% of the federal budget when it's like less than one. because they're just always imagining some foreigner with a big sack of rice living it up on their time and but on merits that's a thing that has to happen like the world has to be fucking habitable for people where they where they live now because there's no situation where the entire world population becoming liquid and just moving across its surface is going to facilitate um anything other. than a techno regime of like essentially uh mass incarceration beyond anything we could imagine just large scale human containment because people in flux like that are not able to resist, they don't have anything, they don't even have like the confidence of of like of mastery of like a geographic area they're familiar with or access to community resources, they're at the... mercy of just the global tide poll of capital and and the the the um and at the mercy of its technological expressions. at that point, yeah, like the the need for enough, the need for those people to actually be like inputs into the... economic system is going to be basically not nill, they will be uh disposable, they will be a begmans a gambin's uh homo saucer. and the funny thing is this mad iglacius with his 100 billion with his billion americans book he even says he just coughs his mouth and says uh of course we'll uh there will have to choose the type of immigrants we accept like i'm sorry isn't he supposed to be uh advancing this left-wing case for open borders and sneak it underneath the the the the sleeping uh got maw of a right-wing reaction by by camouflaging it with this nice nationalism. that they love so much, he still concedes a regime where yeah no, we're going to get uh the people who we who we need to like run our fucking server farms and then you're still going to have to have massive uh uh uh a massive system of border enforcement if you're doing that so it's it's not even the thing that his uh pathetic uh us bad faith defenders claim this brilliant attempt is to to uh rebrand. leftism, it's it's just more neoliberal bullshit, but but it it's it's his fetish for a neoliberal uh re-imagining of the city, like he, the reason i think that he is so enthusiastic about marcus is because he genuinely has absorbed the idea that everything good about uh like social life is to be found in the uh gentrified American urban center and that therefore we need to facil that that metastasis of that into like the uh the mean experience of being an American, that that's his that's his conception and the reason he thinks that is because that is the place for the Niche's last man to live, because it gives you the sociality, it gives you all of the uh, the most superficial uh uh the benefits of living socially, access to different foods and and entertainment options and things like that, uh, but with none of the spiritual uh connection and like community formation that comes around different social like uh dense social relationships and he needs that to be the thing so that buse he is trying to imagine what policy will benefit the most people, and he has to imagine the people are him, because we all imagine in some way that, you know, everyone is like us in a fundamental way, it's just we hope to get deeper at the root of it than him, he is only able, he is so shallow, he can only get to, no, everybody should have this, coffee shops and tie restaurants and stuff, this uh, this thing where i get a ver of uh as much of a varied experience in the most superficial way uh to to uh essentially imitate like a a social existence while I'm basically on my phone. to him that's valhala, that's Utopia, and so he wants everyone to live there, and he imagines that the free marketization of urban life will will bring that about, that it's it's the restrictions on on development that make that the case, which is very much backwards, the the the restrictions are imposed by a governing ideology that is powered by a governing um mode of production and political economy, and that is what dictates though these regimes, so sorry buddy, you got to, you got to get down to the studs to make any of this stuff accessible, because I think that that kind of dense urban lifestyle is is is, I've lived it, I think that it has benefits and I think that in a less alienated world it can be the basis for real social unity, or social cohesion, but uh, it's certainly not something that is a a uh panasia for any of the current. horrors of life in this country, and also and I mean the big thing to say fuck you about iglesius is that you can see the outlines of a coming ramping up of war with China as an option uh coming down the pipe, like Rathion is putting out like yellow journalism now in order to get people by behind this idea that we have to confront China. We like the the our our economy and our political order are going to push us towards conflict with China. I know that you know there's the full war full fledged war would be bad for both of us and so that kind of thing can prevent an escalation, but some degree of like rising tensions and military spending to go with it and military activity to you keep the... blood flowing through the American hegemonic circulatory system uh is going to have to get expended and anybody wants to help that along uh can uh stonk my donk fuck off what you you're going to fucking help us uh send the sixth fleet to to carpet bomb the fucking um uh south china sea and and start a shooting war over uh koyon and matsu uh so that you could get starbucks on every fucking corner in Iowa, you fucking asshole, but politically, like Trump blames China for the virus and I got to tell you guys, Biden's going to blame China too, once he's in power, sure, there's going to be Trump, but it's going to keep being bad, and that's going to work less and China's still going to be there, and the incentives are going to be there on both parties to ramp it up as a way to express. off the real horror of how badly this was fucked, how badly we've been failed by the political leadership, they have to put it off on somebody, and the other party is not ever going to be enough, china is going to be more and more the bipartism source, the the place, like look at the guys that people talk about as the successors to Trump, they're like guys like hally and cotton, they're not doubling down on his fake uh piecenick shit from 2016, they're r they're fucking uh ramping up against China to as is Trump, there like any kind of non-interventionist paleoconservative strain in Trumpism is getting squashed out by covid and by the by the the the the psychic demand to find a uh supository for our anger and it's and it's uh China, China, China. I think the fifth column of newcons colonizing the DN the Democrats is a threat. I mean, that thing about that is stuff like you know, guys like Bill Crystal and from in the Lincoln Project, it's not that they are doing some sort of stealth takeover situation, it's that they are being absorbed, it's it's it's not an invasion, it's it's a merger uh on on the on the fully conscious terms of both parties, because the democratic uh plan has been... since 2016 to turn the republican party into a party of purely white grievance and pull off every other sector of the ruling class away from other than like this the buddy garedy beautiful boter type small bourgeois, everybody with any real connection to the global financial order, the people who used to be the rockefeller wing of the party and absorb them into the democrats and make the republicans the white grievance party of the of the downwardly. and that means absorbing all these people and so the project now. is is happening, it's been accelerated, Trump winning was actually the best thing that could have happened for that project, and the reason this is happening, it more than anything is that, so the it's not true to say that in the two-party system we have in this country that the two parties aren't actually representing like different agendas, they are, they aren't they aren't literally the same in their expression of in the expression of their political philosophy, because there is actual conflict there, at the level of you know political economy and things like tax distribution and regulation, government structures, actual differences, that is true uh, but those differences uh are expressed through a political class that differs basically in its relationship to global capitalism, you have people connected to finance, old money, the people who have been rich in America the longest, and then the the as the country filled in the regional powers that grew up, the small producers, small manufacturers and small uh like landholders and bourgeois, they grew up, even though of course their relationship to global capital is very real, it is not perceived as such, they they perceive in fact global capital as a uh competitor for them because in some ways it is, the system as it equalizes, it sacrifices some interest. others in order to maintain homeostasis, like tariff regimes harm some uh uh internal companies or internal markets or internal uh uh uh fuck internal resources or whatever industries that's the word i'm looking for industries like some industies are harmed by a terrif regime others benefit their connection to the hells of power and their you know the crucialness the influence they have within the... political system kind of dictates which is which and so there is a real conflict there uh and that has been for most of American history the contours of the actual battle between the two political parties. the new deal changed that, the new deal brought the working class to the table as a third point away from small producers and small bourgeois and uh uh international capital. the working class as such gained a seat at the table through. their mass agitation around the great depression, they essentially they they they barged into that the top levels of influence within the democratic party because they were able to assert their independent uh political agenda in the face of the crisis of the great depression. that persisted for a while after wagner act, the NLRB put gave gave uh and and at political level the fusion of the top levels of the biggest uh labor unions with the Democratic party. happen at the same time, those relationships persisted until the 70s when the crisis of productivity, the the crisis of energy uh led the political order to at that point uh sever the last connections between a at that point more abond labor movement that had lost its vitality, lost its ability to assert itself as a uh as a equal partner in this in in these political negotiations between these centers of political power uh and crawled off and died under the porch and we returned and since the 19 since Reagan basically we have returned to the political order being a battle between finance capitalism and local uh uh local small bourgeois. now the thing about that is is that even though this is the conflict, it's not expressed evenly through the parties, there are parts of both that support each, but the acceleration of the... and the way the culture war uh beliefs are conditioned more than anything by social class and specifically college education we're getting to a point where they're the the the voters are polarizing around once again uh the small boojoois and global capital and because now the issue are whether to college or not, and the the party of global capital is the party of like college, that becomes the party of uh, you know, minorities uh, and uh, or like some minor is black, black people more than Hispanics, because that's a more fluid racial category, uh, and college educated whites against this lump party of, no, red pilled uh, I would say red pilled minority males. and then white white uh non-college educated whites uh both above and below like the poverty line or or like the $1000 line. and this is a part of that process, the assimilation of the old uh, the the last uh uh vestige of the old eastern elite which formed the globalist uh part of the Republican party, because the war that started in the 60's between goldwater and Rockefeller and which was won by Regan in 1980 for the side of the small producers and for the side of cultural reaction uh, it still has taken decades since then for the last hendrirals to break away, and Trump has accelerated that process, and now we are reaching a point where there will be less and less of a uh, or at least if the democrats get what they want, there will be less and less of a republican uh, like uh, global capital connected. um uh party win, it'll be just pure like Robert Welch stuff, and then you know uh, pissed off guys in camel hats and stuff, and then everybody else will be in the democrats, that's how they think that they can, even without offering any alternative to austerity, nightmare hell world, will be able to hold off, hold on to power because they will have the demographic. in their favor in that younger and younger people, not only are they more diverse, they also hold cultural issues closer to their chat hearts because they've grown up with no other issues to talk about or considered to be on the table really. all right, i got to get going here. uh, who's julius creen? leave me alone everyone's yelling at me. I'm going off here now, bye-bye.
