 Oh stop son, speed limit, nobody going to let me down o rocking band, hey mama, look at me, I'm on my way too. the promise like you, i'm on a hellway to hell on a high way to hell, b, on a high way to hell, on a highway to hell, and i'm going down all the way. on a high way to hell, where is my money? i dmed one of the people who still active who i bet two years ago, q and on would not result in the arrest and prosecution of any top-level pedophiles, he's still online, he's retweeting, he hasn't tweeted for fucking days or weeks, just retweeting other people. will give me my money, he bet me a grand, it's over, Trump left, not with a bang, but a wimper, and it does look just from a cursory glance that uh, the queue people aren't are actually absorbing that it's over and that the whole thing was a lie, which wow, i don't know how the hell you pick up the pieces after that, i honestly think there's a good chance that a lot of these people will just become a political. because if the one hope that you've ever seen to change things turned out to be a fucking conartist and the one thing that ever made sense to you turned out to be a big lie, how are you supposed to move forward with any confidence? some people are going to recommit of course, but uh, i think a good chunk are going to are going to become quiet to some sort or another, which is good, take take a minute, take a breath, i mean when you swing in a miss that bad, you can't just get back in the box, you got to limber up a little bit, you clearly something is off in your swing mechanics if you are going after this bullshit, there is the, i mean it's a it's funny how little we've mentioned we've emphasized this, but seeing Donald Trump, seeing the person of Donald Trump and thinking, that guy cares about me and wants me to be better, he cares about America and wants America to be better, that is the greatest piece of like self deception, i can imagine, like you willingly stabbing yourself in the brain with a fucking knitting needle and cutting out the frontal cortex, because it at least provides you with some relief from the itch and the torment. well, fuck those people, irrelevant, where's the violence, where is the insurrection, where what happened, what was where why the stuff i'm supposed to care about? I was supposed to spend the last two weeks since the sixth nashing my teeth and all those other people who did that were in the same spot now and who had a better time who had a better time in the intervening two weeks honestly they probably had a pretty good time too because the key thing to understand about these people is that they like it so it really just boils down not even to whether or not you're enjoying yourself it's what gets you off and worrying about that kind of thing does not get me off, worrying and fretting and making sure that I'm presenting enough concern is not anything that gets me off, but for these freaks, they love it, poor poor uh, dan Besner and Amber, co-host Amber, did a totally reasonable, cogeent, well-written piece about Q and on for Jackovin, and these fucking people lost their shit, because it did not do enough to condemn them, as if what's written in the pages of Jacob is going to determine the contours of the on movement in the next years? absurd, but i will say the funniest thing about it is people insist that you can't talk about Q in the context of causes, you can't talk of the immiseration and more specifically the uh destabilization of formerly secure economic positions that makes people uh vulnerable to this stuff, you can't talk about that, because that lets them off the hook for their racism and their hatred and their evil, which is exactly what conservatives said about terrorism, when you would say: uh, hey, how about we make it so that fewer people in the middle east want to kill us by, I don't know, scaling back our imperial designs on the region? no, that is uh giving virtue to these people, this is not focusing on their wrong and sinfulness, it's the exact same approach, which makes sense, because they're trying to create a fucking um, a internal white terror, 911. context for them to uh to stave off critique of Biden and uh justify expanded uh expanded internal surveillance and uh repression. I don't think it's going to work, I said this on the show, but the big reason that the war on terror went the way it did is because the republicans had a willing partner in the democrats, like they were both on the same, they were uh in after 9:11, the democrats were happy to play along and to be the heal, to be the uh, to be the to admit their weakness, basically to admit what was that they were wrong, to admit that the republican view of the war on terror, the republican view of foreign policy, the republican view on what it meant was the correct one, and that the only. difference between the parties is that the democrats do a better job of it, the democrats are going to try it, but here you've got an opponent who will no sell you. the republicans as we saw in the impeachment hearing, none of them, what, they got 10 votes, they were not falling all over each other to say, look, we understand, this was a huge deal, we're so sorry, we have to look into ourselves, nope, they said, uh, actually, you guys said that uh rius were good last summer, so uh, you're hypocrites, fuck you, and without a he, it's like uh, like when uh was like Rody Piper would do a a chop like slap the chops of Hulk Hogan and he would just start going and he would no sell it that's the republicans here so that means that the dynamic is not going to uh persist and they're not going to be able to wave the bloody shirt the way they want to, but man the media and uh their handmaidens are going to try as hard as they can to do it, holy shit it's going to be non-stop banging this drill, but I think I think that that was the high water mark, maybe wrong, and if I'm wrong, I'll apologize, but even with only a few weeks retrospect, it looks like that Capital Hill thing was a was the high water, it was the picketch charge, it was the it was the culmination of a movement, and then when Trump disavowed it immediately, got kicked off social media and then slunk away with his tail between his legs and then Biden got in there with no... no problem, uh, I think that it's that the momentum will be dissipated, that doesn't mean that violence will go away, like I, I've said, stacastic violence, stacastic political violence is here to stay, I think, but the idea that there's a genuine Trump threat to our horrifyingly, banally evil mechanisms of democratic government. uh is is going to become more absurd as time goes on, although man, I 100% get how if you are just like a regular person who doesn't have like a political critique of the system as such, but is aware somehow that the system is bad, watching the media, I understand how it could turn... you into a trumper, i could understand how it could make you and start thinking, well these guys are all in charge, you got the guys in charge and then you've got the media all saying the exact same thing, i mean the people, the the the press, the media during this uh inaugural was north korean in its supplicancy to, they might as well fucking had people come out in a in a giant um a coordinated dance move and like spell out corn pop on the national mall, they they talked about how Biden is a good and just and and and kind-hearted man who's going to bring uh, he's going to bring back uh uh unity and uh respect and all every good thing, he is an harbincher for its return, and when things are. just as bad as they were before he became president and the media is still talking like that on behalf of one party, how do you not think that the whole thing is fucking rigged and that their'? or the only person is on who is not on the side of this evil status quo is Trump because he's the only one who has been pronounced anathema. Trump is anathema, none of the the republican party is going to be brought back into the fold. Mitch McConnell and Roy Blunt were out there yucking it up with everybody. and the irony and the f funny thing about this, it's really ingenius how this works, so I really do think that everybody in the media, everybody was on there for all those networks talking about how Biden is light itself, and he's going to bring back civilization and he's going to banish the demons and how our long national nightmare is over, uh, they think they're helping, they think that the Trump movement and and and the the capital storming is sign of a fundamental undermining of necessary crucial american institutions of government and media and that by going all in for biden they're helping, they're like uh there is celab 2021, i'm happing, i'm happing, but they're just pouring fucking sand on it, there's pouring salt on everybody, because having everybody talk like that, having this university fucking uh uh hosana's for this guy when you have to know it's not it's things are still going to suck and it's all just your feeling better because that um because the images are more pleasing to you than the images of the trump years but the fundamentals will be the same by doing that you are ensuring that anybody who is just watching this and is not invested in the symbology that you are is going to take away from it that you're all in this on you're all in on this together and that Trump is the only one who stands against you, although maybe not Trump, honestly Trump might have fucked this thing, who knows, we'll see, but man, he really did just shit all over everybody, didn't he? he just went out there and said, have a nice life, goodbye, oh and i'm going to just, i am going to uh pardon all of the most corrupt political scumbags on earth, literally swamp dennisons and no no sang, no snowden, no manning, no uh fucking real the winner uh, nobody who is threatened, nobody who threatened the the state apparatus, celebrities and fellow celebrities and fellow politicians, people who he could identify with personally, because that's all he ever could do, because he's a fucking psycho, and yes, you're a chump forever believing in him, but i think a lot of people will see are coming to the conclusion that oh, this is full of shit, but "the challenge of there being any coherent post-trumpism is how do you fill the void of Trump? and I don't think you do. I think it's going to be a splintering. I think you're going to see uh a a a wilderness period here, but what's going to keep the Republicans uh in play and likely get them back the house even with their being a pretty much open civil war now within the party. I mean, Liz Chaney has already had some local yahoo announced that there's challenging her for the house next year, anybody who spoke against Trump in the last two weeks will get a fucking high profile primary challenge, how that foils down though, i don't know, i'm not doing predictions, but man, it was really nausiating watching the news, just people can. people manufacturing a reality right in front of you, you're watching something that by any objective standard is a hair razing nightmare. just think about this stripped of the ornament, on the national mall surrounded by 25,000 national guardsman and 12 foot tall steel barriers, they led this fucking nearly 80 year old senile man out to bump into things. uh, swear allegiance to the flag, get his fucking uh druel wiped away, and then read a fucking speech off of a teleprompter, and in, well everyone's wearing masks and there's no uh, actual crowd because of a rampaging pandemic that's killing thousands of people a day, that's the reality of that fucking inauguration, but what we were told we were seeing is some triumph of American democracy in the... return of of values and sanity and and uh and compassionate leadership and everyone doing that thought they were thinks that they're showing things up, but what the... really doing is undermining it even faster by ensuring to anybody watching that yes, this is exactly as rigged as it looks like, this is exactly as anti-democratic as it appears to be. well, who's up for some the last? you were a real one, so let's go through this chapter by chapter, the first chapter is about urban poverty and immigration, we get all the good Jacobs stuff about the tenaments and the horrible conditions within and the reform movements that attempted to ameliorate those conditions, all of all of them headed by people who thought that the immigrants who lived in those conditions were barely human anyway, which obviously complicated the process of trying to do the amelioration. and he talks about the assim. of those immigrants into the American experience and this is where he really emphasizes that uh like the people made American culture what it is like actually gave it culture were the immigrants the middle class protestants who were trying to turn their lives into everyone's life uh that was where culture went to die uh and the degree to which that model prevailed in the 20th century is the degree to which American culture failed to exist, because that protestant home that they were fixating on, this middle class home is is is the place where uh, the middle class expectations, values, morality could strain behavior and thought to such an agree that meaningful artistic expression is almost impossible. like yeah, where what American culture is, is is black, it's Jewish, it's uh catholic, and and poor, poor protestant, poor white protestant, middle and upper class white protestantism created basically no culture, very little, and uh, he finally talks about... baseball and how it became uh a a and how it was in fact a immigrant sport, it was played mostly by german and Irish immigrants uh the next chapter we got Lizzy Bordon uh and which is although he said he claims white claims that she was guilty uh um the baseball Statistics Dork, uh, I keep, I want to say Rick James, what the fuck's his name, last name is, I know what this guy is, Bill James, Bill James in his book about American crime claims that she was innocent, but anyway uh, he uses her as a good example of uh, how white womanhood, which was this thing that these systems were designed to protect, uh, was being uh, undermined from within, and the anxieties that that created in the people who saw. everything going wrong, people saw that all the the things that uh that the contract lab, the contract uh freedom, individuated citizenry, individuated liberty notions that they had built uh was creating the opposite of what they wanted, and they were freaking out about it, but the main thing I wanted to talk about here uh is the populist. because in this section we talk about the rise of the populas in the west and the midwest, and um, I think of the populist movement as the last gas of the of the small-hold, yoman, conception of American liberty, politically expressed, before it was subsumed. in the 20th century by broader ideas of like the working class uh buse at this point working class political organization is still incredibly incohate you have things like the nights of labor and you had things like the uh the AFL, but there was very little political expression, there was no, there was no labor party, nationwide labor party of size, there were a few uh, there were things like the greenback party of the 1870s that that were attracted working labor working class votes, we saw how Henry George attracted working class votes from Iran for mayor of New York, but there was no single uh labor party, workers uh, if they were catholic uh mostly voted for. the democrats if they were part of the urban machine uh, if they were protestant in the north anyway, they probably voted for republicans, because those sectional uh distinctions mattered more than ideology, and it is, and white points out that one of the things that is retarded American, working class political effect efficacy, is that partisan formations emerged before the working class became articulated as a self-conscious notion, uh, in most in the European countries that got pushed the bar ball of socialism further, mass uh universal manhood sufferage came at the exact same moment that the working class was coming into being uh here the the the the party system that they were dealing with emerged in the 1820s uh when the model of employment was uh if there was employment was uh artisan based mostly where wage labor was relatively. and usually a condition, a a transitory condition of life, and so when these western and midwestern farmers who had followed the railroads out west, as the they've been told to by the republican uh forebearers, vote yourself a farm party and told you can find freedom with land, property will be your liberty. don't have to worry about politics, just vote for the Republicans, we'll keep a nice uh lid on inflation with the gold standard and will allow you to bring your crops to market, but with the infrastructure that we've invested those tariff moneys into and allow you to uh live freely, well by the 1880s uh many of them were finding out, oh uh the system of crop lean um f financing. and the uh manipulation of freight rates by railroads and the deflationary nature of gold standard is actually making that making it hard for me to be free even though i have land and the populist party was an attempt to articulate that politically to articulate a a producerist idea of American uh freedom uh and after the defeat of Williamton Brian in 1896 and the and the transfer of uh like the reformist drive into the two political parties from outside of them where the progressive movement did most of the uh the work that they demanded but not through the expression of a like a coherent political party like the populists uh that dissipated and was replaced by what we got by the end of the by... certainly by the end of uh uh World War One, a political concept that was consumerist in its conception, where people's freedom was not a freedom to make, uh, it was a freedom to buy, and that uh changed uh, fundamentally the nature of political contests in this country and ensured for one thing that uh the working class when they did become a more coherent and effective political uh force would be amenable to exchanging the demand for control over the conditions of labor for more purchasing power and that is what we ended up getting in the 20th century, we got a working class that over and over again, in its political expression, traded autonomy and power for consumption, and that turning point for that, I think really was when the populist were broken, and one of the reasons they were broken is that they were unable to link up effectively with the working class, as white shows, the Brian, actually saw their share of the urban working class vote go down even though the urban working class the catholic ones anyway democrats because this was a protestant dry movement evangelical in nature and that uh and was not like culturally amable and because the democratic party keep honking i'm consuming people saying there's a problem with the oh boy it's choppy oh no Oh man, that poem was dog shit, I'm sorry man, but that fucking poem was terrible, just awful, all right, well let's just move through this then quickly, I'll I'll I'll probably not go too long, um, Okay, we've got the uh, the depression of uh, the panic of 1893, another uh another uh, another railroad panic, this time cause started in Argentina, but uh, once again causing a significant collapse in um credit and liquidity and there was nothing the government could do about it because it was committed at the top of both parties to the gold standard. the gold standard was inviable, even though the base of both parties was probably broadly in favor of at least bimetalism if not full fiot currency, the upper echelons were completely controlled by gold.s and that speaks to the the way that uh the democratic impulse in the in the American political system is will always be dissipated and uh diverted away from the like loadbearing structures of whatever those in power at the moment think constitutes the the governing status quo uh like it turns out that you can actually do a lot with fiot currency and you and you can still have capitalism. and you can still have uh banks and you can still have credit and you can still hold your citizens in thrawl to the money interests even with fiot currency, but nobody knew that back then uh and more importantly the people demanding uh currency devaluation uh and and more currency in the markets were almost universally people hostile to existing power structures so just by that virtue alone uh it was not going to happen and well you might have the votes at the grassroots to push for uh expanding the currency at every level higher as you get towards the senate and the presidency you're getting to uh points where uh electoralism is diffused more and more away from a um from i hate to use the word but accountability. and that accountability is replaced by uh systemic incentives and that's why you had in the middle of this depression you couldn't get one of the two political parties to come forward and say hey uh what do we do something about this until William Jennings Brian shows up at the convention in 199 1896 and gives the cross of gold speech which cuts through all of the molarchy cuts through the bosseries cuts through the existing structures and allows the uh this demand to come forth, but it is, rather than the beginning of something, it really is the last gasp of uh this producerist sort of jeffersonian jacksonian model uh when it comes back again after uh World War II in the form of you know the small government conservativism that and libertarianism that is now uh you know the... dominant ideology on the right uh, it is in the it's not it is uh been fully subsumed by consumption and I do think it's interesting that one of the last things that he talks about is the... role of the courts in establishing corporate personhood and a substentive due process system that uh made it very difficult for uh workers to strike, but made it very easy for corporations to do almost anything they wanted uh, and that is another example of the constitutional system doing what it was designed to do, which is to dissipate points of responsibility away from democratic accountability, because the judicial branch is of obviously the least uh uh democrat. the the the branch of government least sensitive to democratic pressure uh and the people appointed to jud judgeships are most likely to be amendable to people at the very top of the party structures that might be in power which means they will reflect those interests and the period of the late 1890s or the late 19th century that that brought about the progressive movement, it was a creation of, it was a self-realization on the point of this middle strata of political class, judicial and legal, media, and corporate managerial, that the competition that had been the the bullwork of the early capitalist system in America was counterproductive and disruptive and needed to be reduced, and that's when you saw the rise of the the trusts, and that's also when you saw the assertion by the judicial branch of the prerogative to define the constitution, to essentially make effective working class political organization almost impossible, and it's only when you have those things in place that the progressive movement which comes after this can take hold. but that's for the next book in this six in this uh series uh i is that one in there let me they they have i don't think they have one for the whole thing yet in the Oxford structure but uh it looks like there's no Oxford history for the years from 96 to 29 so there's like a 30-year gap so so one's got to write that, that'll be interesting. oh, it's called reakened nation. i'll probably read that. so the next book uh, uh, we're not going to start right away, i'm going to think about it, i'm thinking it's might be fauners reconstruction or maybe dubo. is black reconstruction, not sure yet, i'll take uh recommendations if anyone has them, if anyone likes wants to dm me or something, uh, i have read late victorian holocausts, that's a great book, mike davis is absolute king, there's no question about it, am i still like skipping or is it good? i don't have just so you guys know i have no way of changing any of this i like people say switch to a different numbers and ps or whatever i don't know what any of that means i'm good now okay good it's skipping oh shit i stopped skipping 20 minutes ago that's good but like that poem just back to the poem thing that poem is a perfect example of this you watch the poem it's dog shit and then you see 500 people get in a line to tell you how it's the most inspiring thing they've ever seen what are you supposed to? think about that, how are you supposed to think? like, am i wrong? they assume that you will just go with what they want you to say, but like the whole point of media fragmentation is that people can go to what is amenable to them, people can find the voice that is agreeable to what they think already, and what we're getting from the fucking state media about this inauguration is, i can't imagine agreeable to anybody, but fellow bubble members, other democrat, not even democrat. voters, but democratic, self-identified voters, people who identify emotionally with the democratic party, the way that republicans identify emotionally with not republican party, but trump and that means you see that, and all of your efforts to try to you, reinstill these values about the sacredness of these American institutions is just going to further drive people away, and more than anything it's just humorous because you know they're so excited, they're so excited to be able to do this, to be able to go on tv and assert that that we are in the best of all possible worlds now, but what that means is they're going to keep being surprised as things they don't want to happen happen as and as people keep acting away that they don't want to act. what was the poem about? i have no idea. i mean, i know it's mean to make fun of like she's a kid, she's like 22 years old, but you know. There is still something offputting about being expected by a unbroken chain of people uh to be throlled by it. I will be checking out the new Adam Curtis documentary that's for sure. and one last thing I want to say about the Biden speech, which was just absolute snoozefest, he he annoyingly he didn't have too many fuckups, they really know how to keep him gassed up during the big speeches, but the thing itself was incredibly boring and and and uh saporific, which of course is the idea, you're supposed to so soothe everybody back to sleep. uh, but there is the part where he quoted augustine and said something about community is defined by the common object of its love, and the sec and what he said was some shit about like the common, our common love is, i don't even know, i don't remember, it all sifted through my brains, but whatever it was, whatever abstract. it was, it was incorrect, the actual common object of our love is free refills, that more than anything is what has spurred a lot of the political violence of the last year is being kept away from our free refills, and the fucking soda machine is running out, the syrup is almost gone, the bubbles are dissipating and all they have in all they have to replace them are words and the words are supposed to do the job and they think that should work because it works on so many people, but more and more it's working on people who are the least affected who have the most soda have access to the most refills. All right, I think I'm going to probably stop some. but to back to the Q and on one more time and the comparison between the way we the rhetoric of the war on terror and the rhetoric now, one of the things that seems to make people really mad when you try to really talk about the the the Trump phenomenonon as a social phenomenon is that if you do not emphasize at every moment racism uh and and authoritarianism and fascism, that you are letting them off the hook, that if you talk about a material conditions creating the ground on on which these things emerge, that you are undermining the the the rhetorical case against these people which needs to be made, yes that is mirror to the way that the right talked about terrorism, but what i think is really interesting also is that when people say that when they say, oh, economics, these people are just racist, well sure, and they're delusional, and you're not going to get them, and their argument, you shouldn't court them, you shouldn't think about what they want, because they're raving maniacs and they don't even know what they want, that's true, but when you talk about addressing any kind of pathological social condition, whatever by addressing the material conditions that spawn it, it's not really about doing anything about the people you have who are currently part of. that movement, it's about stopping the flow of people to it, it's stopping people otherwise would not do that, do it, and there seems to be this idea that the queue thing is like a dormant dna strand, like just pings after a certain moment, and then people will just flood its ranks, and if that's true, if there's something just in the DNA of like lumpin white uh, culture that drives them towards conspiracy and white nationalism. the activator is precarity, and so the way to deal with an immersion phenomenon like that is to reduce the amount of precarity that is felt by these people who might be triggered that way, but people resist that because if you could ever become that in their mind, that means that you are irredeimable and you don't deserve better material conditions, the very thought that you could be tempted. intoqus means that you don't deserve them, and that is the liberal logic that underlines uh the whole project, the the whole liberal left, social project, because we can't make things better for anybody, we're going to punish the deserving, and the emergence of uh this maga movement and queue is a chance to beat the snakes out of the grass and punish them, which is exactly. what the Bush administration tried to do with terrorism? Hey long, every man, a king when no one wears a crown. I think. talked a bit about Hulong in the past. Huelong is what you is is is is the southern expression uh, it's not a coincidence that Huwie Brown came from the deep south, because the deep south was the least was the area where uh, where like working class politics was least able to find purchase and was replaced instead with real demagogery uh, the kind of stuff that uh, you know, the the brahmans were always afraid of, but uh, at every point though, that demagory is embedded by the very ruling class to claim to be afraid of it. in this section of the book they talk about how the the adherence to white supremacy and specifically the democratic party as bullwork of white supremacy, meant that the populist party could not make inroads among the uh agrarian workers of the south, of of the... small like share croppers and stuff who were or the white ones anyway the ones who could vote and were uh also exploited by the croplen system and railroads and everything uh and that's why the populists had to nominate Brian in 96 because the southern populists uh I mean sorry that the uh they'... that they would lose in the south, that they would not be able to compete, that they would end up giving the presidency to uh the republican, which of course is always the problem that third parties have to deal with, and one way you deal with it is by not caring, and there were populists who didn't care, in fact it was mostly the southern populist who didn't care, because the real southern populists have been fighting for years against the right-wing burban democrat aristocracy, fucking... hated them because they were happy to use intimidation and violence and fraud to keep them out of power just as they had the republicans before them, but it was that partisan adherence of southern democrats of southern small farmers that ensured that the populist could not uh form a unified producer front. how was the australian? causing voter suppression, the Australian ballot is the secret ballot, it is the written secret ballot. In the north, a lot of recent immigrants didn't write or speak English, they were able to vote because Tamani, for example in New York would give them a ballot that was filled out already, and say go and vote, and they would, having to have people go into the room and write the ballot themselves, meant that people who couldn't read English were on. able to uh knowledgeably exercise the franchise. Who is the second funny? president, okay, that's a good question, uh, somebody asked, first of all, somebody asked, was anti-immigration, the left position. i honestly think in the 19th century, if you're talking about popular politics, left and right are kind of inapplicable, they're a little, they're ahistorical, you had populism, and then you had uh, like the establishment, and populism was anti-immigrant because immigration. was a uh compete because immigrants competed with native labor and that has always been an issue uh that sort of and but it is also self-defeating because immigrants are still going to come and if they are denigrated and uh and ostracized by uh the populist forces the same way that black free labor was in the south you create divisions within the labor if not moral, i guess inevitable would be the word when you have a situation like in the late 19th century of of declining wages, declining standard of living and increased immigration, but kind of uh, but and it was not universal, like the Knights of labor were anti-chinese, but they made significant real attempts to try to woo uh southern black workers, because they could they could identify southern blacks as american and and amenable to like the American producers ethos that they were trying to protect in a way that they could not imagine the Chinese were, and those kind of those kind of distinctions can only be broken down by by the sort of cosmopolitanization that comes with uh capitalism, but anyway the second funniest president, okay, i guess George W. Bush was kind of funny, although looking back on it, the stuff that was funny about Bush just seems so benall now, it's kind of amazing, I think Biden honestly might end up being in the running depending on how seniil he is, or as least how how cenial they allow him to be seen as, but we don't know yet, in terms of ones to haven't yet, in terms of ones from the past, george HW Bush was kind of funny just cuuse what a dork he was, I mean he puked on the Japanese prime minister, talked about how he didn't like uh uh Brockly, he had Dan quale as his vice president, another guy where you look back and it's like, oh that's adorable that people were amused by that, uh, but no, like if he if he was, if you could have seen him every day and if you could have heard him every day, Andrew Johnson would have been the answer, buse Andrew Johnson is the president who's most like Trump in person, and not coincidentally Andrew Johnson is the last president to not um appear at the inauguration of his successor, because he was like Trump, an incredibly bitter little asshole who was all consumingly narcissistic and viewed the entire uh pageantry. of like the American political um the entire the entirety of American politics uh through the personal lens, through his own validation of himself, like uh, Johnson claimed that he was doing what he did, imposing an incredibly lenient reconstruction on the south uh to protect the small poor whites of the south who he thought because he'd been a union. uh before the war and opposed to uh the slave power um because he thought that slavery hurt poor white people the most and of course slavery did hurt poor white people, the lack of the concentration of wealth in the hands of the planter elite meant that the south was widely underdeveloped compared to the north, it had almost no public schools of any kind uh and very little infrastructure that that poor people could have access to, because why what what's that do? for me as as a grand d of the fucking mississippi delta to have these fucking assholes going to school, i don't fucking care, it doesn't, it's no skin off my ass, it's not like the northern capitalist. this shit to facilitate the flow the the capital flows that they were interested in in uh facilitating, so it did hurt them, but to Johnson that was the only hurt that mattered because it was his hurt, because he had a Trumpian Nixonian resentment of people who were higher up in social the social order than he was, and so even though he was pursuing what he thought was, justice for the small poor white of the south, the system that ended up coming out, coming about at least in part as a result of his actions and re-entroning the planter class after the war, was one where poor whites were by the end of the century in the thrawl of a democratic party that was ruled by burban aristocrats who had no interest in seeing those poor whites advance and who made the disinvestment in public uh infrastructure, the reconstruction governments that came in after Johnson uh left office, the ones that were often uh headed by carpet baggers or in some cases freeed slaves were the only governments during that whole period that actually invested in public infrastructure and public schools for whites and blacks, and you had a figure like Tom Watson who emerges to be a populist to and at first tries to to create a coalition between poor whites and blacks in the face of the persistent uh racial hierarchy ends up saying well if you can't beat them join them and becoming a fervent racist and democrat uh which might have helped him sell magazines but didn't help the poor white people of the south at all. Do I think Trump or his family will suffer any legal action? I don't want to predict much anymore. Mug's game. I would be very surprised. I'll say that. If any of these people go to jail or are even charged with anything. I'll be very surprised, because presidential impunity is baked into the cake. We're looking forward, not backward, remember? LBJ was pretty funny, that's a good choice, called as Dick Jumbo, that audio of him talking about his uh, his bunghole to the guy from Hagar Slacks, that's just funny. There is also a when I went to the LBG library uh, they have a replica of the oval office and they have. have uh a phone, he pick up the phone and it'll just play random parts of the LBJ uh presidential tapes and i i put it up and one of them was him talking to Catherine Graham, the publisher of the the Washington Post, I believe he had an affair with uh and he is just coming onto her like a maniac, he uh, I believe at one point he says, if I was a steer and you were in the if I was a steer and I saw you in the paddock over. jump over three fences to get to you, and of course he talked to his aids well shitting, which is just alpha king posture, and he also said, I had more, talking about LBJ, or talking about JFK, who of course has a reputation as this lotharious lothario, he said, I had more women on accident than that boy had on purpose, he was basically. strickland, yeah, and I absolutely believe that he had a bigger dick than JFK, just for the simple fact that JFK was Irish. uh uh James B cannon was apparently a very erratic. uh and touchie like a prickly guy, like an unpleasant person uh, and kind of like a fussy. sort of school marmy type guy and yes was the first, well he was the gay president that we can say pretty definitively exist, i mean there might have been other gay ones, but Brucannon was definitely gay, which that's tough for the gays because he is definitely a fucking bottom five president, not bottom one, that's fucking Johnson, but definitely one of the worst ones, his predecessor Franklin Pierce uh was just a hardcore alcoholic, which says a lot. because it was hard to become an alcoholic in the 19th century buse everyone was shit faced all the time anyway. Garfield was a fucking nerd. Garfield was one of our most uh uh he's a he was an a real uh book bookwer real nerdlaner and he loved Lesania. All right, I'm going to maybe go in a minute here, see if there's maybe one more. question for us say goodbye, frederic was so gay that he wouldn't look at women, like he actually wouldn't like set eyes on them, but he didn't, he also after his boyfriend got his head cut off in front of him by his dad, he uh, he focused on war. The Brits are freaking out about Biden in what sense because he's gonna reunite the uh the 32 uh countries? I don't think he's gonna reunite them, I think they're doing that themselves with the bloody brexit isn't it? fucking Irish, she's barely Irish, it's like half Irish at most, yeah, apparently now for the first time in American history we've got an Irish, a catholic president, Catholic speaker of the house and Catholic Supreme Court chief justice, which would have made Thomas Nast's fucking head explode, remember this fucking uh, remember this one, one of my favor, my favorite Thomas NAS. the fucking uh the bishops coming out of the ocean like alligators, they did it, they conquered, people who in the 19th century those fucking uh bleached out brahmins thought were incapable of republican governments are now or governance are now at the top of all of our institutions really? show that uh that the stuff that people fixate on is uh rarely the shit that matters, but that's exactly why they fixate on it, because it allows an illusion of progress, an illusion of issue uh addressment, addressment, an illusion of progress towards policy, towards a better republic towards the shining city on the hill. when in reality you're just you're just treading water while the machinery continues to grind behind the well all right folks peace out.
