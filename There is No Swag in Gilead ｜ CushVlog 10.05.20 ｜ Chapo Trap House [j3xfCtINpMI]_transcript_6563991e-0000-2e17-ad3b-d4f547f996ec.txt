 We interrupt critter Vision to bring you this important news. President. Donald Trump has shit out his dudo ass. Early reports indicate that the dood ass has been lost in the sewer system of the White House. As a result, the president is now assless. It's right. President, the flash coming from Washington, apparently official. Five pm, eastern standard time. The president has lost his due to ass. Ah, so he's going home tonight, so everything's fine, I don't know why everyone was uh, freaking out, thinking that he might be sick, he'll be fine, they just pumped him full of a uh uh, they pumped him full of Hunter S Thompson's trunk load of experimental drugs over the course of like three fucking days, he's gacked out. on mind bending steroids and they're going to send him home because he's bored. It's fine, I don't know why anyone is saying anything other than that. You're pretty owned if you think that he's got any problems that he's in trouble at all, he'll be fine. We're on track now for the Herman Kane, which would be the funniest possible outcome. He runs, he does not die before the election, he runs, he loses to biden in a kind of an anti-climactic landslide, and then he dies like a week later of COVID. uh, that is officially, I've looked at it by any metric, that's the by cosmic irony, by just just desserts, I mean just removing the fact of Joe Biden being elected president, while being completely unaware of his surroundings, that's funny, regardless of he's running against, you put these things together, and then him dying of the disease that he said didn't have exist for six months, it's too funny for words, so that's why I'm thinking it might have to happen, he is cuuse he is on the Herman Kane track buse herman. he was doing good for a little bit there and then, but I will say this, Trump might not die, he is already in abomination, he is a medical odity that he's alive regardless of coronavirus, this human refrigerator of fucking uh pig meat, this guy who's hard as a canned ham uh being alive at this point is is absolutely defiant of all science and reason so he could survive COVID, but I don't think his swag will ever come back, I don't think he will ever be the Trump who haunts the nightmares of libs and and uh jolts the groins of our nation's maga faithful, or amuses the uh the coping and uh allegedly detached overproduced elites who listen to podcasts, but like he's not going to be able to golf, he's never going to be able to like the... said today they asked him did he have did he have lung damage and they said that's a hypoviolation they said what his fucking blood pressure was is that not a hip hippoviolation he's fucked like his body is cashed he might live for another 20 years like just hovering around in one of those dune senso bells but he's uh he's never going to be the swaggering pimp uh rolling rolling through uh hooting crowds throwing out plague infested hats to him. uh, he is absolutely leaving against the medical advice, there's, I mean, you, you, not only is he leaving against the medical advice, he also took a bunch of experimental, high uh, highly dangerous drugs for old people uh, because they told him to, because he told them to, it's called VIP syndrome or something like that, uh, where like if you have enough, because doctors can only kind of like browbeat you into doing things using their... authority over you as medical professionals and eventually for most people your confidence gives out in the face of medical certainty, but Trump, not only is his confidence never going to give out in the face of anything, he is the president of the United States, he's got the nuclear football three feet from it at any time, so he took all those crazy drugs with uh just buse he wanted uh, he wanted to get it over with, he wanted to fix it, because this whole thing has always been finding a silver bullet to just fix it because he does want to think about it anymore, he doesn't want to think about anything revolving around vulnerability or frailty, because it's cuuse death is is what stalks him, because his consciousness is the only thing that's real. you can't even conceive of his own death, which is why he acted the way he did after he got diagnosed, which is amazing, he went to a like going to Ohio and throwing his hat into the crowd, okay, like those people, they're nothing, they're they're they're pons fun, he has no, he has no uh respect or need for them, but he went to a fucking $250, a plate fundraser in New Jersey and coughed all over the buffet for a bunch of high level republican donors, like you either do that because you are some sort of like uh sneaker agent, like there was a joke early in his term that he was actually some milless third world is trying to bring the empire down from within, or you just don't even think of it, like the idea, oh no they're going to, i mean obviously you don't care if anybody else gets sick, but there are certain people you probably wouldn't want to get sick because it makes it harder for you to do whatever you want to do, but that's still, you can't like split the baby that way, there's nothing but delusion. all the way down, and that I think is why it's useful to talk about capitalism as only operating out of its own perceived self-interest, because even though it is this algorithm, the value form that dictates human decisions, uh, you know, at there still has to be a human involvement uh in directing like the optimal flows and living that life of of maximal profit extraction. or or the life of being amongst people these people, these these lizards, these non-human entities who rule over us, who have no human feelings, like they do not have human feelings the way that regular people do, which was always what was very useful about lizard people as a metaphor, because they are reptiliann even if they aren't actual reptiles, uh, but what that, but you can't live that way, you can't live as a human being, constrain the way humans. like you're going to die, like this is all going to end, everything you've done, everything you've piled up, it's just going to sit there and someone else is going to use it, and you're it's not going to be you, and like dealing with that reality is what brings us to groundedness, it brings us to an awareness of our vulnerability and our uh and the value of others, because others will be here after you're gone, and if you truly value other people, you will find sucker in their persistence after your death, and it will make dying, being aware of your death, getting. closer to it over time, more bearable, but they don't have that, so they just have to believe, they have to deny that it is going to happen, like they are psychically uh fixed around an idea of their consciousness persisting eternally, and like the ones to think they're smart channel that into life extension shit, like the peter teels and the jeffrey upskins, oh they're going to cut my, they're going to put my brain in a robot body or whatever the fuck, and the dumber ones like Trump just don't even think about it, they just pretend it won't happen, and when they do have to think about it, they get a little angcy and then they do something else, and then the thing is that's why they're miserable, because at least like a Peter Teel guy can have some sort of some sort of at the you know right before night comes, when you're getting ready to sleep and there's that that existential chill, like he can think, oh yeah, no, I'm going to, their technology isn't there yet, but I'll just take enough of this teenager blood serum to keep me younger so that I'll make it to 150. and then the robots will be there to take me into my deep night nine billions uh but trump doesn't have that what he has is nothing and so he is miserable every moment of his life god that fucking thing about him about him freaking out and going am i going to go out like stanchera am i gonna go out like stanchera is dumb buddy from new york real say and that's the thing, it's like uh stancheer was a friend of his, they hung out, but now he's dead and does he matter at all, does Trump think about him at all? no, the whole the thing he can't imagine is, well that'll be me, that'll be me someday, that will be me someday, can't handle it, and that means that means that he not only, what it does is, yes, obviously makes him a bad person, one of the least worst people we have, but it also makes him dumb, it makes him bad at been accomplishing his goals because it requires him to delute himself, and the thing is is that up until now that hasn't really hurt him, because all he's really had to do at any given moment was have people pay attention to him, like he didn't, like we've I've talked about this on like his genius was never business related, it was getting famous and being famous because that's what gave him a sense of validity, that's what kept death away. was the idea that he was known, if other people know that you exist and other people are talking about you, then you will never die, uh, and and he was and he's been so singularly driven towards that goal. and so fucking good at it that it has led him to the presidency because he coincidentally happened to exist at this precise moment in American history is as things were sliding towards this you know total subsumption into spectacle the one person in a position to embody that spectacle was Donald Trump but now there's a thing covid that does not actually care about fame like it actually is a leveler not in the sense that it affects everyone equally because obviously it affects the most vulnerable most but a thing that would hypothetically uh get you no matter what, and of course he made it happen by treating it like a not a big deal, because he had to treat it like an ad, like people say he's a germhole, i don't think that's really true, i think he thinks people are disgusting and he doesn't want to touch them, i don't think he thinks he's going to get sick, he's afraid of getting sick in an abstract sense, just like he's afraid he's going to die in an abstract sense, but i do not think that he thinks of it in concrete terms of like getting sick in a specific way, you know, like he's not a hypochondriac around specific ailments because that's too real uh he's just repulsed by everyone and and they just call it germophobia but he because a real germophobe would have taken precautions against getting the goddamn virus and he didn't do it and that wasn't just him like well i denied it was real so i have to live that truth no he dinied it was real because that was true to him and now and he was making it true to everyone else uh and that meant that he was going to treat it and he was going to be cavalier and now even though he was the person probably best positioned in the... country not to get it, he has it, and it's going to fuck him up, even if it doesn't kill him, I he's it's going to fuck him up, there's no way it doesn't, you can only think a guy like that as immortal until he dies, just like him, and the reality of it is hitting him, like so he's he's suffering more than usual right now, he is in pain, even if he doesn't die, he's in real pain, nothing's going to happen, I don't know what that means, I mean something happens. every day of every every day, something happens, what do you mean nothing? he's not going to die, well then something else is going to happen if that doesn't happen, nothing is going to happen as can never be true, oh man, i watched saturn live last night, i mean it was a kind of reassuring to have it back, but then you watch it and you just see the way that they try to take. something like that debate that we watched which was a psychotic carnival of late uh imperial uh decadence like uh fucking madkig ludwig playing with his own shit but um they turn it into something relatively normal and then of course they brought in Kamala cuuse like if you take that as face value those two old men going at it like that and neither one of them having anything in their head but but but like the ghosts of ideas and and memories and slights and and uh and without any connection to a greater project without any ability to express or direct the flow of events running for a president, it's genuinely like I said it it's freeing but also if you have any sense if you have any investment in the system terrifying and nothing has more investment in the system than something like SNL SNL's existence SNL exists to normalize. everything is it happens and turn it into just fowder and and and and strip it of any context and strip it of any implications, so you watch if you're a regular lib, if you're a SNL viewer or SNL writer, you watch that debate, the thought is, oh, it's okay, because there's Harris, because there's a VP, because there's a whole party is going to catch us, even though if a guy like Biden can get in that position, and that's the position we vote for, then clearly something is off in this equation, we have we have un, we have miscalibrated the fucking power dynamics in potentially fatal way, but that's okay cuuse there's hair, mommy kama is going to come, mommy kama is going to come and she's going to rest uh our head in her boosoms and and lullist to sleep with a nice uh a nice soft caribbian lullide, just fantasy, it's fantasy uh Jim Carry wasn't that good, i thought jason sudakus honestly was pretty good when he was on the show and he did Biden cuz he did it like a big dumb Labrador retriever he wasn't senile enough but maybe they could have given him a little a little of that now buse he mostly played him when you know during the 2016 and and after that when he was still mostly known for uh just being a loud mouth and not and his brain hadn't really shut off now shut off completely i don't really get what Jim Carry brought to it or why he's doing it it's very odd don't get it. um, somebody asked me about lovecraft country? i've spoken a number of times about lovecraft country, i've stopped watching it, uh, they went to Korea and i'm like, okay, no, uh, we're not, we're not. intersecting with everybody on this, this is exactly what you don't want, but i just i i brought it up uh because this person reminds me that uh trevor from champagne sharks who uh was a good podcast and he's a good twitter account uh he had a thread about lovecraft country and i thought it really hit the nail on the head in terms of one of the deep things wrong with it beyond just the woke pander it's that um it's clearly written by Yes, I'm sure the writers room was was was diverse as hell and and majority black probably uh, but clearly not working class, clearly not anyone who's struggled in their life uh, because the concerns of these characters who were black people in 1950s, Chicago, uh, the racism they experience is very much filtered through the concerns of like the bourgeois, like... moving into a white neighborhood or you know uh dealing with white co-workers, like these are all the the stuff of modern racial micro aggressions, which you know um are part of the greater phenomenon of American racism, but are the least grounded in material conditions, the most epinomenal to the system we have, but the characters in this in the show uh, you know that what they don't suffer, they're not dealing with racism. in a class intersection at all, because the people making it have no context for that, that's true of the people who make all this fucking art, which is why the representation argument is so hollow, because at the end of the day it's just a representation of different strata of the bourgeois, of of relatively well off people arguing about racism and and class and gender issues through the their least consequential lens, not unconsequential. not meaningless, but far this from the the the center of gravity of these oppressions, which is where people are economically vulnerable. i'm not talking like obviously they have a lot of like intense stuff like they got shot in the diner and whatever, but but that's uh, but that's like with the horror genre stuff as opposed to the characters concerns themselves, uh, apparently they'... they showed the emitill funeral playing the song cruel summer by bananarama, i don't see that to me doesn't really feel like anything other than uh than just a project that is unmored to real pain, you know, this just seems like it's people play acting towards oppressions that they've only experienced an echo of so. so I'm done with it, I'm done with it, everyone's excited about a fratelli, good old uh Francis, telling capitalism to back off, I mean it's a good sign, I'm certainly I'd rather have Francis than fucking uh benedict right now, uh, but you know, it's it's a it's a real question. how any institution as borabund as the catholic church could really participate from the top down anyway uh in any meaningful movement but it's it's not terrible uh i have not seen i didn't know i thought the good lord bird was starting in november i'm pleased to see it started i'll watch it tonight and i will uh report back on the next stream. I am uh, I am, I'm a little worried, uh, it feeld a little uh, it felt, like I said, feels a little soy, it feels like John Brown is a little epic, they're trying to make him relatable or whatever, or they're trying to make the whole thing relatable, which I think is the opposite of what you should do with that material, you should make it as for it and alien as possible to make you have to reexamine this shit like over the chasm of time as opposed to trying to make it make it realistic or... like uh relatable to to people in our position, but I'm not sure yet, I have to see it, I still wish, I sure sure wish it was Michael Shannon, I mean Ethan Hawk's okay, he was really good in uh, really good in uh first reformed, but the trailer didn't give me a lot of help, a little report back, and then I think depending on how it is, I might do - an enebrated past chapo about John Brown, I know that uh the dollif just did a three-parter, but I would do it more as like John Brown uh in the context of the civil war and the like his role in leading us to a civil war, like his what he what he means. was to like the broader anti-slavery politics of the time and then of course his memory and culture after that. what comes after Trump for the GoP? this is of course a question. that's on everyone's mind now that the motherfuckers uh uh might be on death store and i've been thinking about it a lot lately and i think that you will see in the immediate demise of Trump either he loses in a humiliating way or i the joke of like oh he's gonna you know like come back and run in 2024 i think that i mean now especially with the covid that's off the table i don't think that's going to happen so that means trump is going to be gone soon and and the question is, how's going to fill that role? and I don't think any one person can, I think that he was so suigeneros, I mean he is suiris in every respect, like his body is, how he is a defiance of science and God to be alive, and he defies political reality, when he emerged on the scene, he had a combination of in of fame uh, and the specific type of fame, like he was, he was famous for being rich, but not in the way that like Steve. Forbes was cuuse Steve Forbes ran for president as like a rich guy who is going to run things like a business and got his ass kicked even though he had the flat tax as a as a gimmick one it's because taxes aren't really what's going to move people you need something more flashy if you're going to run a celebrity only campaign a celebrity first campaign uh and two he was a fucking dork trump was famous for being famous but also he was famous for being or he was famous for being rich but he was also famous for being famous like he was he had a tv show, he was charismatic, people knew him in the same context that they knew other celebrities who they watched in performances and his performance was of a rich, successful executive who made tough decisions, like he was literally like the way almost identical to the way that the president of Ukraine is a guy who played the president of Ukraine on a TV show, it's that same level where where the spectacle has subsumed the real, um, and that's no one else is going to be in that position, no one else has that kind of fame or like maybe they have a shadow of it, but he's been alive for 30 years, so that means that he's not like Mark Cuban, younger people might know him, but like great grand, i don't think grandparents know him, people who vote don't know him, trump has been famous for being famous for 30 years, so he's known by everybody, uh, and that fame meant that he didn't even have to run put any money into his campaign, his campaign was as news in a way that other campaigns aren't. campaigns of regular uh regular politicians, they have to compete in the media for media attention. they have to do because they don't have a lot of money to beginning, they have to pitch themselves in such a way that they can accumulate money, they can get backers and they can get donations and then they can buy earn by by unearned media, but the earned media, i mean he literally did earn that media, but for being for being mononomanically fixated on being famous for the past 30 years, 40 years. whatever he fucking earned that media uh that's another thing that's totally individual to him uh he was able to run uh appealing to the core sensibilities of a huge percentage of democrat of republican base voters by appealing to things like immigration above all else and having a a specific uh big broad large scale uh policy around the position of immigration it wasn't just immigration it was building the wall. uh, and he was able to do that well being totally independent of the party itself and having no uh, being in a position to be totally un uh constrained by that party's macchinations, like the party would never have let anybody go that ham on immigration, they had their white papers from the 2012 campaign that said Romney lost part because we alienated hispanics too much, so we have we cannot be anti-immigrat in this country uh and and so as a as our main focus and our main party uh platform, if we want to scare these Hispanics away, so they so anybody who had to be within the party, and also the media had like anybody other than Trump had to was under the um discipline of both the media and the Republican party, because they require both the media and the republican party to even have a spot to get to a position of patronage uh by donors and then by the media in terms of attention and and and uh and buillines and and and minutes on TV that he didn't need to pander to. There is no one in the aftermath of Trump who meets those. criterion: some people say Tucker Carlson, but Tucker Carlson, I submit is not anywhere near as famous as Donald Trump is, and well Tucker Carlson might have a similar effect in the um primaries of like galvinizing the largest chunk of former uh Trump supporters, I do not think that his appeal translates the way that Trump's did because Trump's appeal was partially or significantly a political, which uh Carlson's is not. and I think that you can wipe out any sitting officer, you can wipe off any um actual like political office holder off of being a comparison to Trump, Tonton, hally, no one uh fucking desantis, anyone who holds office, if you hold office, you are a regular politician, which means you can, you're not as famous as these guys as this guy, and you can never be independent of the media or of the party the way that he could be, and you're also fucking nerd, you're a fucking charisma vacuum because you're not famous, he is famous uh, like i joke about the my pillow guy, but the my pillow guy's problem is that he isn't that famous either, he's just like he's part, he's known by the same trump people like Tucker Carlson, um, because we're not just talking about getting another nomination, we're talking about competing for power, and any of the guys who might plausibly gather in the Trump base to a significant. I don't think have the ability to transcend that base, which is what made Trump specific and a specifically meaningful uh uh political phenomenon and what make would make Trumpism an enduring political phenomenon is if it can compete for power, and none of the people who are mentioned as potential successors to Trump, in my opinion fit that criteria. I would say though that one might emerge through the process of jockeying for position in the after aftermath of Trump, but who that is, I don't know, the the timeser will tell that uh, but the one thing I would say is I think there will be a period of instability, like the times of trouble in in in Russia after the death of uh of uh of goodenov, uh, oh, by the way, this is... I wanted to say this about Trump and and specifically uh, before I forget. So Trump is was in the hospital for the weekend, first president to be checked in the hospital since Reagan got shot, uh, he was on a bunch of wild drugs including a very powerful steroids that are that have um significant psychological side effects including mania and um uh uh hallucinations and At no point was anyone seriously talking about Pennce taking over uh no like him holding power you know 25th amendment short term just and I think that speaks to the fact that Trump is not not appointe a successor and that certainly if he did Pence is not it that Pence does not have what it takes to fill that spot uh and also that I don't think i I think more than anything it proves that Trump has not been making executive decisions for a while, like the joke would be, well what if he gets on the steroids and hits the hits the button, that's a real possibility if anyone in that room thought that they would let that happen, you know what I mean? I think that at this point, maybe there was at the beginning of his term, maybe there only has been in recently, but at some point the people in at the trigger points around Trump have basically agreed. either explicitly or implicitly amongst themselves that there are certain things that they don't tell him, there are certain things that when he tells them they ignore, like we know for a fact that he ordered the assassination of uh Assad, ordered it like wasn't just talking about it, like told Matis to do it, and Mattis just said we're not going to do it, we're not doing that, so that means that like he is not actually been the president in the way that we think of that job for a while if he ever was. which is which which which makes the fixation on him as a person and our like i was talking about after the debate our compulsion to scry through the entrails of his loggaria to find meaning all the funnier is that he's not even he's not even doing the job that you think he's supposed to be doing he is just sitting there he's watching tv the whole time like Reagan and it's I think that's a thing people kind of get and maybe even walk around thinking in the back of their minds, but it doesn't prevent people from getting so round up. I much prefer speculating on his physical health than like what his words mean. That's if it's all gonna be just uh just this this senseless augery then at least auger around something funny and whether he's shooting his pants right now uh whether his brain is like cooked like he's got 110 degree fever and he's hallucinating that he's at studio 54 with uh with Janis Dickinson that's funny. Which of Trump's children will sleep the nomination? I honestly do believe that Don Jr. is going to run for office because he is, Don Jr. was perfectly named because Don gave him his exact personality problems, but he has less of his dad's talents, which is very much what happens with these families, because they take the money more for granted. they have less to do with the actual business uh and they fill that with uh um anxiety, they fill that gap of of effective leadership and and uh control over their lives with with anxiety around specifically their him and his dad uh their dads buse donald Trump has been shaped his whole life by the absence of the love of his psychotic father as uh and the same thing is true of Donald Jr. I mean apparently he after college went and was a ski bomb in Colorado and he wrote about it in his stupid book and he kind of talks of it wistfully and you could see that like there was a desire maybe for him to live his own life and he ended up going back to New York and and working for his dad partially because he couldn't think of anything better to do and he was lazy and dumb and he wanted money without having to work for it and that was the easiest way to do that but honestly. i think more than anything is because he thought if he did that he could get his dad to like it like like don did like don became famous to make up for his father's lack of love. i know this is all very dime store uh psychiatry but like this shit is real you know like these kind of phenomenon like are our relationships with our parents and stuff they are foundational and you can see with these famous people especially like the extravagant trauma that they're dealing with like their whole lives are expressions um of course now Donald is where where his dad was, his dad wouldn't quit, his dad kept working, well after he had Alzheimers and he uh, and he would go into office and they would uh give him a phone that only went to a secretary and they would give him blank paper to write on, which is of course, that's literally what they did with Trump to to have a photo off, they had him writing on blank paper uh, and so now Don Jr has the same. need and his dad is as disinterested in giving it to him as his dad was, and now he's going to fill the gap, he couldn't fill it with fame the way his dad did, because his dad was more charismatic than him, and his dad was smarter at being famous, his dad was was a genius at being famous, don Jr. isn't a genius at shit, don Jr. is a perfect mediocrity, don Jr. is a perfect example of the absolute uh emptiness within our the the the most recent minting of... our ruling class, the copies of the copies of the copies, the fail sons fail sons, uh, and so he is going to go because he can't be famous, he could never get famous uh through his own talents, he's going to get famous the way that nerds and dorks and losers get famous and that is by politics. i mean, he got famous basically as an accident cuz his dad did, and now he's going to try to keep it going by running for something, and i do think he's dumb enough to go straight for the presidency instead of even trying to build a base you know as a senator or something, but he or maybe somebody can talk him into running for senate, it basically it basically will boil down to which political grifters get a hold of him and scam him, somebody who's got a plan for him to run for senator somewhere or governor whatever, or somebody who's just like, yeah no, we're going to do a pump and dump on this chump, pump and dump on the chump and just have him run for president and then skim all the donations for viral ads where him and dab at wounded knee or something, but uh, it's not going to be him, that's one thing i can say, he's he's not going to be the the the uh, the califf, he's not gonna, he's not going to be the the, he's not gonna follow Muhammad, he's not going to be ali, he just doesn't have any of it, avanka. people were very impressed by her speech uh, i honestly just don't think her energy vibes with the GOP now like what she does is very girl boss uh and it's very honestly very democrat uh and the republicans i think they want what her dad's putting out, maybe it's different with women, i don't know, but uh, i could see her running for something, i just don't think she cares to do it, i don't think that she is seems terribly interested in doing it, like you can see why don Jr. needs to do it, i don't think as in the same situation, eric. as stupid as he is is definitely smarter than the rest of them because he is appropriately arms length this whole thing, maybe aware that it could definitely bite them all in the ass or some of them anyway, and of course, yes, the real answer to this is always baron, barren is the god emperor, uh, baron is the quizzorok, baron will uh, will imbibe the spice malange and fuse with the sandworm and rule over us eternally and declare uh interstellar jihad, we know this, god, Camala Harris being president in six months, it's gonna be such a fucking trip, she is someone that no one likes, that no one, even in California they don't really like her, no one voted for for president, I mean literally she didn't make it to the single fucking primary contest, just... popping in there like hey, i'm the president now, after having a president who's so fully, is such just the center of this storm of psychic energy to have somebody who barely anybody can muster a thought about, it's going to be very weird, that energy is going to have to go somewhere, question is where does it go, to see uh tolsey could be the candidate who split who leads q and on, someone said tolsey is the queuenon candidate. i mean if see that's the real wild car is what happens with q, not the trump base, the smaller but distinct and growing section of that called Q, the ones who have this religious uh fixation and have this this uh eschatological cosmology with Trump at the center. i think if Trump dies they will think he's still alive, they will he will become the occluded mady. There's no question of that, the same way the JFF Jr. is going to come back, they're going to come back together at the right hand of Jesus, uh, and they are going to really be looking for a Messiah, someone to herald the the return of the king, uh, and who that is, that will be interesting to see, I guess Don Jr. maybe could do that, he could be the queue guy, but among elected officials Tolsea Gavered really stands out uh as the one to do that buse her whole deal seems to be doing the trumpism stuff like like the whole Trump vibe but without Trump and the associated stuff of Trump and if Kyun gets like keeps accelerating in its abstraction away from the original premise, especially if Trump dies, it could become, it could be, it could be adapted, but we'll see, we'll see. might love, they might love Trump too much, they might they might get too fixated on the blood, the blood is the life, the blood is the life, the blood is the life, can we print money forever? I mean, for the forseable future, yes, are we move for? the end, if we're the end of the global supply chain, we're we're it, as long as we're the global reserve currency, now that might change, people have talked about the Chinese and the Russians trying to move us away from the dollar, uh, but that carries a lot of other consequences with it that, I don't think any other that those other countries are really ready for yet, but I think it's inevitable honestly that we get off the dollar and it will be good to get off the dollar, it's just how we do it, if it's part of like a trade war. that'll be bad for everybody, i think, but if it's part of like a mutual drawdown from global higenomy to like a true multipolarity where we lose our position, like we don't lose everything, but we lose our position as the the uh executive authority of global capitalism and we distribute that power more equitably, that would be good for us uh buse, It would require it would allow us to finally you know hopefully all depends on like what the political like what the political uh background? of it would be, you know, we're either gonna, we're either gonna build guns, we're either going to be build bombs and planes and aircraft carriers to kill uh everyone until the wheels fall off uh or we will, and then there's just no more dollar and then the whole thing collapses, or we uh sort of spread that around, lose our role as the global hegemon, and most importantly uh uh military overloard and that allows us to recommit resources we do have, the real productive capacity we have we do have to, i don't know uh building our own infrastructure uh creating a viable country instead of just a fucking massive meth lab. but i mean if i if you had to ask me what's more likely it's gonna be that we're just gonna keep building building planes and bombs until uh but wall street isn't the only force someone says street is pushing for the loss of dollar hegemony. i'll tell you who else is pushing for the end of dollar hegemony? the fucking trump administration and more broadly the American government in its overuse of sanctions. like people take for granted that the US can just sanction another country and they don't really stop to think, can anybody do that? can you just sanction people? no, you can't, you can't control another country's economy, unless you are the whole the the one who princess. fucking money they use for their transactions, and then you actually can, and that's what we have done, and we have abused the shit out of sanctions, uh, and as a result, there's a growing resistance to them, and the resistance to the the dollar Germany that underpins them. but right now the response to Trump dying or Trump dying but to Trump getting sick and this is obviously not really empirical or rational, I'm just talking from like my my individual perception and my original emotional that the just the vibes I'm picking up, which of course they don't mean shit, but I after the convention, after the debate I saw it I kind of think people are just going to want to settle down, like even though things are terrible and only going to get worse and it's like we have the an eviction crisis and 2000 dead on its way to half a million and and you know the economy is is in a k-shaped recession, a k-shaped recovery where where although people who are worse off are going to uh suffer the most and for the most the most deeply, it's terrible conditions, but that rather than Trump leading us to this confrontation. point that I think a lot of people really thought was going to happen and I never did, but I could certainly see why people got to that point, because he really was bringing us to a heightened point of of of social paranoia uh that when you looked at it in connection with this you know incredibly uh bad economic and social condition in this country could make you connect one to the other and think this is happening, but I think what instead happened is that Trump is proven to be sort of prefigurative, like he is, he he through a number of flues popped up in advance of a like a true crisis of of of political uh uh power, and as a result that this election is ending up going to be a big deflation of the politics bubble, even though things are bad, I think because a lot of what we think of as like this political hot house is being stoked by... people who have not really suffered, those are the people who are the most politically engaged during this period. you can talk about how oh, of course things could lead to confrontation and conflict, look how bad everything is, it's like, yes, but people who are most directly affected by how bad everything is are generally the people who are least likely to be stoking this sense of political armagedden, uh, and i think we're going to get, they see the horror of others and it stokes them further towards towards freienzy. but their frienzy is psychological and in origin, not material, and I think that that kind of thing can only be sustained for so long, and I think that at the end of this election, when he loses, which I think he will, and and certainly if he dies, there's going to just be this popping, this deflation of psychic energy, not among his most deep supporters, they're going to go into the queue hole and there will be sticastic political violence out of those people, but I think even among a lot of republican voters there's just going to be this exhale, because the people who are most politically uh polarized right now are also the people less least likely to want to risk what comfort they do have, you know. to fight over resources that are still for them, not scarce. uh, somebody said, will there be as much violence if Trump dies as if Biden wins? I honestly think if he dies, there will be less violence, because I think most people will just the most fan fixated on it will just disbelieve it and like burrow deeper into a into a narrative which which will put them farther from the snapping point like that's why the that's why him losing an election definitely cause a number of people to snap because there's no way out of that one there's somebody else on tv that's there's the thing called the president and it's not him anymore that's a real thing uh uh he's over there not being president anymore but like if if he's just gone he could be. anywhere, he could be anywhere, he could be, he could be, he's included, he's he's, he is the the king in the mountain sleeping and awaiting his resurrection, and that's not going to work for all of them, but I think a lot of them who might otherwise have snapped are gonna, are going to retreat further into fantasy. but I think even some queue people honestly might just wheel back and say okay that was weird you know like when they were really into am way or something kind of a vaguely embarrassing chapter of their life that they don't want to talk about you know I know that sounds like oh that's uh Poliana that's like Biden saying the fever will break I don't think that's true uh I think by the time you know by the time campaign like presidency really gets in there, either it's him or Harris, you're going to see an explosion of political bringsmanship among republican governors, like guys like desantus, secession threats, it's going to go wild, I'm just saying is that in the immediate aftermath, there's just going to be a low, I don't how long it last, maybe gets 100 days, but then it's going to explode again, cako baby. Apparently so many some number of people have insisted that these are blue jays, congratulations to anybody who can tell that. I that's I don't have that kind of birding knowledge. As for governing, nothing will get done. Biden's not gonna accomplish shit, and the way you'll know that is when they if the senate obviously if the the republicans keep. the senate, nothing's going to happen, period, except for a grand bargain, but if they keep the senate, or if they lose the senate and then the senate votes to keep the phillibuster, nothing, but without Trump there to stir the pot, it's going to be harder to get people emotionally invested in that, you know what I mean, you need that figure there just drawing all those eyeballs, that entertainer in chief. which I don't think Biden or Harris is going to be, I think at this point uh the democrats could definitely take the senate, uh, polling is looking very bad for in a number of for a number of republicans who I kind of assumed were going to do okay, like Jody Ernst until a few months ago I thought was pretty pretty much assumed to get reelected and now it looks. like she's honest obvious she's done for like she's down by over 10 points she's fucked uh hell alasca seat is apparently tied lensy gramam is in genuine trouble uh so is Tom Tilis I don't know how much the dorky sex scandal with uh his democratic opponent's going to matter I don't I mean does that stuff matter anymore at all? I honestly don't think it does Susan Collins is done Cory Garder and Colorado is finished that's a lot i mean I think that uh Dug Jones is to lose, but I think he'll be the only one they lose, and if he's the only democrat who loses and they lose five, something like that, uh, oh yeah, marty, mcsally's going to lose in Arizona. uh hell John might win in georgia uh like all you need is like i say all you need is what four of those to go even if you don't hold on to uh even if you don't hold on to jones and uh yeah someone says dug jones is going to win i just saw a poll that had tuberville up by like 10 so i don't know it is at all but i i honestly do hope i am rooting for the democrats to win the senate, i'm earnestly rooting, not because i think it will necessarily lead to anything, but just in terms of you know if my job is in a in one sense to put it pretentiously politically. education, you can't get much more politically uh, politically educating than watching uh, democrats take power and refuse to use it on principle, uh, of course, for most democrats, they'll never ever ever realize what's happening, but it's not about all of them, it's not about the center mass, it's about the edges, it's about shaving off the edges. A new NBC Poll has Trump up 14? I'm assuming not nationally. What state? Oh, Biden up 14. Okay. I thought so, because that's what I'd see, I saw f up, yeah, uh, like this is where we were on the trajectory towards happening in 2016, as people point out, but Hillary is deeply, deeply unpopular in a way that Biden just isn't, people like Biden, in fact Biden's favorabilities have gone up over the past four months, he was like net negative like 10 this summer, he is now plus two in favorability in the tracking pull, people like it, at least they don't. in comparison to Trump, he is more reassuring, his his brand of senility is less threatening, it's less, it's less anxiety, i mean if you were going to be in the day room, think of it this way, if you were going to be stuck in the day room of the nursing home with Trump or Biden, who would you rather hang out with, who do would you rather watch wheel ofshion with, and there's going to be no, I mean, there's 0% chance that there is a comey letter type situation, like... That's not going to happen, there will be no Komey letter uh, if anything there's going to be more shit with Trump and the COVID hurting him, because you're in the you are in the day room of the nursing home, you are also an old geezer, you're in this scenario, you are in the nursing home because you are all so old and about to die, just like we are all in the nursing home that is the United States, we are all watching the TV in the day room at the nursing home, waiting for the day. when we don't wake up uh byden is also in a situation where he doesn't have to debate again uh because he can rightfully say. this guy's going to fucking give it to me, he's going to give me a disease, but i'm i don't know if if Trump's going to be in a position to debate next week, because i think we are, i think some people are really not taking seriously the possibility that he is really really fucked physically, because they gave him drugs that are only for use with very severe patients that have that have documented side effects. specifically on elderly people uh, also the the most dangerous period for the disease in terms of its likelihood to cause like a fatal uh heart or lung issue is like 10 days into symptoms, which is next weekend, hard time to immediately there's going to be another debate, uh, i do, i do think it's funnier if he dies after the election than before. which is why i think that's what will happen, but he honestly could die. i took log off, to heart, i dropped off of out of grad school and moved onto a sail boat. hell yes, sailboat, that's where it's at. you got a boat, fuck you global warming, i've got every uh, every possible um condition covered, i have considered the angles, so smart move, and don't we love beautiful boats, folks, don't we love the beautiful boats, we love the people in the boats, but of course the beautiful boters don't have sail boats, they have big old fucking outboards, because sailing requires skill and ability and discipline, and these people don't have any of that, which is what makes them so disgusting to be our rulers, because they are the Dom Juniors, they are the the the second sons of the second sons of Empire, and they have done nothing to a chain the power that they have, they wield it with absolute lack. of uh of respect for it, uh, acknowledgement of its power, terrible, it's it's a good example, like you know, the old wasp elite they sailed, because they were uh, they were, they were part of that ruling class that saw itself as distinct, and it felt that it needed to have certain uh uh things to... to ratify that like HW Bush, the last was, and now they've been replaced by people who never had that, like the the the people succeeded the American dream by just acquiring uh, that that's that's that, that was the the the unifying like class destroying power of America is that it removes noblesso blige from power, and you know in a respect that's good, because it unmasks power, it removes its its performance of virtue and uh, it's performance of um dessert, you know, uh, but also it's just kind of gross, it's gross to watch. and also they are they don't have the freedom and and uh independence of the old elite because everybody's in hawk now everyone every women rich people are on hawk I mean look at Trump for Christ sake the guy is basically function like people say he's not broke he's not broke he has but what he does is he doesn't have his own money he has access to a endless bottomless pool of credit which is in effect the same but which psychologically is different he has he doesn't have the independent of old money the independent of old money of the old elite of the landed elite, well we be live streaming the democratic debates, yes uh, and I think that will be very funny because of how important how much the the the press is going to be trying to build it up, build up the answers, there's going to be some... disputes about everything that everyone is saying, they're going to get deep into policy, that the the uh media response is going to be very policy having, because that is going to be them trying to reassert that the position of presidency has meaning, that that these people have real responsibilities, and they represent real political ideologies and policies, so that's going to they're really going to h they're going to really just go ham on it. uh, it it will, and I'm trying to think of how I'm going to to add add, I'm not going to fisk, I'm not going to give it, I'm mostly going to probably uh do a vibe checks, just vibe checks, I'm going to try to disengage completely from the content, especially since Pentz has that really awful evangelical whininess, which is very, very annoying if you listen to it, uh, evangelicals are the winiest people on earth, they're so fucking aggrieved and everybody's... being mean to them all the time and oh my god just throw me in the lions then already and it's from a position of total superiority and power it's just awful uh and he is like one of the worst examples of that every time you ask a question uh of them it's like it's kind of it's it's an imposition that you're even asking which is why Trump is so fun when he just darms those people. just doesn't like panders to them in an insulting way that intentionally lets them know that he has no respect for them and they just have to take it, well you know he's he's like cyrus, he's a he's a noble pay. getting fuck you buddy, you have to fucking take that shit, and pence is the perfect uh embodyment of that, just the piss, the piss jug holder, i'm not going to get as drunk as i did in the 2018 mid-terms, that's never happening again. good lord, what a what a bungle that was, don't drink nearly enough to do that anymore, yes i would like to get virgil drunk though on a on a thimble full of uh of elf mead, get him turned, naryat and yahoo, someone asks, this will be my last thing i uh say for for the stream yahoo is so funny because he is like a don Jr guy like he is he is this fail son sppile he's the shitty uh like the concentrated shit of the greater shit like it's in every way lesser than their their parents but also all basically they are the worst traits of their parents uh condensed with none of the virtues at all now of course trump and don't have virtues person but they have certain abilities and talents and they don't and and and both Neir and Don Jr. have none of those and only the defects, only the ransive personality uh, and what's so funny about Nariya is that because he's Jewish, but culturally he is an American uh, he is a Trump, because that's what that's what Israel becoming a, that's what the Jews getting their own country did is it took away the Jewish part. took away the thing that made jews like of a real chosen and special people, was there, was their orthagonal position to the cultures they were in, that gave that made it harder for them to sort of be be seduced into the mindlessness of of of a national of a false national consciousness, and then they get the country and what happens, they are just as stupid and assholelish and and and authoritarian and corrupt as us, they lose. any of the virtues and it's just all it's all the the worst parts and and now and so but our rich dumbasses they have to blame somebody for why things are bad and they ends up having to be the Jews because that's how it has to be buse it's always has to be at the end of the day some conspiracy if you don't acknowledge the reality of of capitalism is the driver of of exploitation and alienation and and misery in the world you will have to end up, so if you're on the right at all, you have to end up with some kabal, and it's got to be, it's got to be the Jews cuuse they're the ones whose historically have filled that position, there's nobody else who's a plausible candidate narratively, and yet Nair is in the position of having the exact same dumb ass brain as Don Jr., but who's he going to blame, and so he ends up having to be anti-semitic to himself, it's amazing, he posted a fucking uh, meme about like George Soros being led by a by a scheming mercy. being led by like a a reptile person. amazing. that's why na is going to be like the only guy in the world who goes who ends up believing in lizard people, but actually because that's the only ones who that's the only people who could be above the Jews are the reptiles. bolsonaro sons are in the exact same boat. oh god, man, can you oh can you imagine getting? all those dudes together, nair and dj tj and the builsonaro boys going to like hunt and kill the world's last black rino or something, uh, yeah, like the Hussain boys, just the worst the society, the worst our culture, our world's social order could create. all right guys, uh, talk to you guys soon, bye-bye.
