 Ah, yes, awesome. Hey everybody, all right guys, uh, oh, I'm all you happy you're here. Boy, it's been a very informating day for me uh, and I haven't even left my apartment. Uh, I've been really thinking a lot a lot of stuff. I feel I'm hoping to share some things to you to the day that I'm really excited about, but I'm also a little worried about. I have my graph paper, I'm going to have to explain some stuff. so uh first things first is that I don't know if you guys have noticed if you guys have been any of you have been watching my instagram streams i used to do before switching to twitch here uh the last week or so I've had a bit of a um a bit of a satori moment a bit of a uh just sort of a bit of an all-around mental reorganization ego death to put it very bluntly and the result of it is that I've been gifted really with a and it's not out of the blue, it's building on other insights that i've been struggling with my entire adult life, but now they're finally crystallized into a truth and reality that i've honestly found to be basically if you ask me to put it bluntly, if you ask me like what's the meaning of life, i have an answer uh that it satisfies me, that's all i can do, i cannot satisfy anybody else cuz i can't translate the feeling to them, so i have the meaning of life, and of course you might say, sure a lot of people say that. and i bet most of them are telling the truth, the problem is i have to try to communicate it to you guys and i will not succeed, i will only get part of it out, and the question is, i am trying to balance, frankly guys, i'm trying to balance getting this out in a way that inspires enough people to see something to it to talk to me about, and maybe buse the thing is, i'm only going to keep thinking this and only going to know this truth if i keep acting it every day, there is no such thing as unacted upon beliefs, so if i going to believe that this is true i have to act. that way, which means i after interact with the world that way, and that means that if I interact with other people that way, they will see the truth of it just through my actions, and then they will reflect those to me, and it will make it easier for me to live this, because I will be making reality around me in the image of this knowledge, because it's guiding my actions, so that's that's the long and short of that I have to try to get this across to people, that's the only way I'm going to keep it, it's the only way going to keep the... fire uh, the only way I'm keeping the fire in uh, is if I keep putting it out there and trying to explain it, because I'm explaining it to myself too, because I'm using poor instruments, words, symbols to try to get it something that's beyond those, uh, but anyway, I have to try to get it to enough people that people can like get it, believe in it and we can all talk about it and it can reify it, or uh, people think I'm a cultleding psychopath and stop. pay attention to me and then i become someone on the street corner with a newspaper diaper uh trying to get people you know to accept that i am the living god and getting tazed by the cops and put on youtube i do not want that so that means that i have to be very very careful about how i try to communicate these ideas and so i'm not going to start at this level because it's just you can't get there the way to get there is by starting back here with the material here and now this space time and that's where we are and so we need to talk about concrete examples that people can get their head around, so anyway, this is all a long way of saying that when I woke up this morning, I had a realization about Twitter, which is that it cannot be a a place where fruitful conversations happen, or at least not fruitful enough to be worth the effort of doing them. Uh, now I always kind of believe that, but one of the things that this whole revelation has given me is the knowledge that I didn't really know why I believed a lot of the things I believed. and now that I've interrogated them, I found that some of them I only thought I believed and don't really believe, but some of them I did believe, but just not for the full reason, I wasn't all the way to the ground of why, and I realized now the foundational fundamental reason the Twitter cannot be used as a constructive place for argumentation or persuasion or the pursuit of truth, is that it is a und a anti-dialectical space that trying to pursue specifically socialism on Twitter, is inherently impossible because it is because socialism like all intellectual traditions and all uh uh all political movements eventually starts as a dialectical process. and twitter conversation defeats dialectical reasoning, because even though everybody on the terrain of twitter might have the the the shared hope for creating socialism, like give everybody benefit of good faith, they actually do want socialism, but they have to communicate that sense of wanting socialism on a space where their individual material incentives to act are not towards the sort of collaboration with other intelligent. is to be noticed and that notice can take the form of everything from a like to a follow to becoming a podcaster to getting noticed to having people take you seriously, and the only way you can do that is if you stand, if you point out your difference from somebody else, this is also known as leftist in fighting. now the thing is is that there are real conflicts, these conflicts are not made up, but the problem is they cannot be resolved now, because to resolve them is to ruin your position. hierarchy you've established, you have no interest now in actually resolving the problem, because then you're just part of the mass and you're not special anymore, that is the genuine problem that besets anyone trying to get any socialist idea across on twitter, and it doesn't mean we can't get to some truth, we do, it's just very very inefficient use of time, it's like it's like trying to uh, it's like cutting down a with like a hand ax, you could do it with enough time and enough people, you could chop down a secoya with hand hand axes, but no one would, because it's be a wildly inefficient use of resources, time, energy uh, and material uh, and it's the same way, you could get there on twitter, but my god, it's about the least efficient way you can, so don't, so don't not be on Twitter because honestly what Twitter is, it's not for politics, it's for friendships, as much as that is goofy to say, as much as you think, no, I go on Twitter to own people, yeah, but you own people so your friends notice, and they like you more, it's about friendship, and politics is just one of the ways that we create the friendship, and then that friendship in the market turns into monetization and parasocial relationships and all that stuff, uh, but at the at the end of the day uh, you are stuck in this relationship where you can't get to your your incentives, your direct material incentives which are going to inform your actions more than your theoretical belief in socialism because it's closer to your material reality and conditions means that you will socialism will lose every time in the battle between the ego and socialism it will lose because that's where your actions are, that's where your beliefs are, they're not at they're not, your your practice is not at the level of socialism, it's at the level of competing within this uh, this friend network, so go online to have friends and go online to listen to people who you think have something interesting to say, and they will often point out what they have interesting to say by pressing it up against wrong things and you can make fun of the people who are wrong, but no that it can only be that, it can never give you any kind of real insight, it's just about increasing social bonds, the work, the intellectual work is done with them within or off of twitter, and mostly through encounter with the real world in the form of do... things, activism outside of the house, out of the cyber realm, the place where the rubber literally hits the road, where friction accumulates, where the dialectical process is manifested in in the material world, it literally becomes the spirit of uh the machine, okay, wait a minute, don't want to go off too far here, uh, I don't want to get you guys thinking I'm insane again, I don't want to get, I don't want to get 5150, um, shit all right, so anyway, this is all to say that that twitter cannot do what you wanted to do, and that you to do what you want to do, which is live as a socialist and feeling living in accordance with your uh, with your beliefs, which is closer to being a fully actualized person than being the matamaton who does, you know, like when they talk about - small sould bug men, that isn't not, that's talking about a real thing, like instead of having, instead of feeling real validation like you because you feel like you're actualizing yourself through the pursuit of socialism in your life, you get to do a pseudo world where you watch netflix and you jack off and you eat compressed. and corn products and then you find those meat those transient joys, you you put fake meaning in them instead, but that's not because of the peps aren't right of why that is, that's because you're you're in, you're captured in a matrix of capitalism and you have a material need to solve your closest pain, and so that's always going to put you a conflict with the greater need to like push against it, which is why you have to always be thinking about what you're why you're thinking. what you're thinking, putting yourself in place and time at all points, being mindful to use a hippy term for it, because then you can actually get motivated to do it cuuse you know why you're doing it, you need to know why you're doing anything, like i really realized cuz i i finally realized uh, i had noticed uh talking about Jordan Peterson, i had noticed that Jordan Peterson got kids to pick up their room when their parents telling them couldn't, and i used to think it was because they recognized Jordan Peterson from... like the matrix of online and online was like their new uh parents and so they listened their more, that was incorrect, i was wrong about that, now i understand, the reason that they picked up the room and thought it was incredible to hear it from treeden peterson from compared to their parents is cuuse Jordan Peterson told them why they should pick up their rooms, he told them that it would make their lives better, it would give them more control over their their lives and sense of destiny, it would make them, it would put them on a better pat. of action and in parents just tell you to do it, you say why, and it's because they're tired and because they have other things, they don't have the bandwidth, they say because I said so, and then it's just I'm doing something that is in the short term unpleasant for no reason, just as a favor to my mom, you have to be self-motivated to do anything consistently, and so and so all we have are these petty self-motivations of like pleasure, which lead to headenism and destruction, but we can't cultivate anything deeper because don't have beliefs to motivate it, we don't have beliefs to motivate behavior, and and and Peterson gives beliefs to motivate the behavior of cleaning a room, the way that your parents didn't, and that's what i mean by levels of of like reality, buse like i was right at the level that you know there was a difference between uh, i i didn't know why that work before, now i do, like i'm now, i now am righter than i used to be cuuse i know different. things because different things have happened to me, oh boy, all right, I'm trying to reel this back in, I feel like I keep floating off and I got to like get the the fucking coast guard to bring me back. All right, uh, but yes, someone says it's socially motivated, the sum total of our our self, the sum total of free will is the interaction with other people, that all of our we're so never mind, so I address that just not now. because it's going to get me off on a thing and I don't really have the language for it, but trust me, I know what you're talking about and I understand what that objection is, and it I can explain why that doesn't uh, that is irrelevant, um, oh my god, I got to get back to what I was going to say, I'm going to get killed, they're going to fucking throw me off of twitch now, and you guys are all going to stop watching, oh god, uh, I'm getting worried here, all right, what was I saying, Twitter, not good, not a place to find. any kind of uh of of of meaningful conversation that's going to resolve towards truth, you're only going to see people motivated to reify uh uh the conflict, and the way you know that by the way uh is that the way that the mechanism of that is this, like say you've got two sides of an argument on any given issue, like what is to the left of this or or this course of action or this this position, be it like the id pall stupid poll, any million arguments you can imagine if person on one of the two sides is the first to acknowledge the premise, the correct premise that the other person is acting on that arise from true observations of reality, if the first person to do that will then be pointed out as a heretic to maintain the other person's position, because you need to always be in contrasting your leftness with somebody else's insufficient leftness, so the movement, the dialectical movement that is needed to resolve these things, is made impossible by the social nature of it, because the incentives are towards individualizing and building a brand, like we did, like everyone online is trying to do consciously or subconsciously, so that's why you can't do it on Twitter, and so I pop on twitter because I'm not going to stop being on twitter, I have dms where I have a lot of friends I like to talk to, I like to do jokes sometimes and have jokes with my friends, that's what I try to do with twitter, that's what I've tried to do before and I'm just resolving to do it more now. and then sure enough though, the first thing I see is a fucking clip of Nathan Robinson saying not only saying that Carl Marks should never have been born and that things like class conflict and historical imperialism are are not really convincing or like and it's like oh my god because it's not like i necessarily even in getting mad at him because part of this this new approach to reality is to accept everyone's historically contingent nature and that Nathan Robinson is not the way he is for any personal reason that goes beyond the accumulation of behaviors of activities and and and and situations that have led to him being like I he is just a product of mechanical unfolding of the universe, i mean and he still has to, i just i have to treat him that way, if it's true or not i have to treat him that way in order for me to deal with them rationally and not just through anger, so i tried not to be angry at him, but i was still like, i don't want, i i resolved not to argue on twitter anymore, in fact i deleted a tweet i was going to do or i was going to argue something with somebody, and then i saw that, i said, this is so dangerously wrong, this attitude is so... like up now, especially feeling what I feel, I feel like this is so dangerously wrong-headed that someone needs to say something, and so I went on Twitter, and then as soon as I tried to compose this tweet, all of the bad incentives that make twitter a bad place for communication start kicking in, the main one being is that every tweet is powered by some sort of insecurity, a desire to perform something for others so that they will reintroduce that quality. to you that you will you will feel that they feel you're the way you want them to think you are, and that's why you tweet, and so I can't just say this is a this dialect, like these are foundational uh elements of like any kind of uh uh um social movement that has any hope of uh of conquering capitalism, but that's just scolding and that's not fun and that's not you know, that's not chapo brand, so I say no, I can't do that, so I say, if anybody wants to replace Marx with Robinson, because the under the undercurrent of my critique is, who do you think you are, basically uh, and and uh, so I say, look at his uh, peacock outfit, because there's pictures of him in like a mardy graw outfit where he looks kind of goofy, just honestly, uh, and of course he's known for his weird bizarre affected dress and accent and stuff, it's like he's a self-conscious character, it's fine, he's he's true and capote of the American left, whatever. um, and so I just wanted a shortcut, I didn't want to argue through it because that's not fun, so I just wanted a semantic shortcut to check out this goof ball, he's a 30-year-old weirdo, why would he know more than Marx, and of course that gets at a truth, which is that I'm sorry, Marx knows more than Nathan Robinson, because Mark's understanding of the dialect goes deeper than his does, his understanding of material reality, observed from empirical observation and his intellect and his empathy, combining uh have rendered him more an accurate viewer of how the world is, and so if people listen to Nathan Robinson instead of Carl Marks, they're gonna it's going to be harder for them to get the right conclusions because they're going to start from the wrong premises, and so I felt like I had to say something, but I just said it in a snarkky way, and I'm sorry to Nathan, honestly for insulting him, it's like I'm not going to do that anymore because it doesn't do anything, because all it did was it told everybody who likes Nathan Robinson and like they've in liking Nathan Robinson is part of what makes them a good person and a good leftist, a good leftist and therefore a good person, and so to attack that is to attack their central, their sense of being, of course they're going to fight back, and it's never going to be about the actual train of the argument, they're defending a key component of their identity, how is that ever going to be able to be talked about rationally, especially when you're talking about an online space where we neither one of us can guarantee the good faith of the other, and it just exploded and I realized, oh this was see... i have made things worse, the him just saying that would have been x amount of unhelpful, but me pointing it out has actually reified this anti-dialect and made things worse in the long run, like i've actually affected the world for the worse, i lost good place points if anyone seen that show, and i'm like, damn i can't do that anymore, shit. so I've been trying since then before now to answer people who've responded to me in some of the comments with as open the heart as possible to try to get it what I was trying to say and just you know if I feel like I can answer a question confidently if I feel like I can uh I have enough of an understanding of like how this fits into my overall view of the world uh then I can say I'll answer and I have been and it's been. It's been a good exercise and it's making me like feel more confident myself, and the thing is, you're the more confident you are in your beliefs, the less emotional you are about them, the better you are about arguing at them, so much of like uh the deep. platforming mania that's on both sides of politics is essentially people reifying their insecurity and their beliefs, like the they they they cannot, they can't, the idea of debating or engaging with another idea is anathema, because their belief is brittle enough, and they fear that there is someone who understands things more than them and could make them not believe what they believe anymore, but those beliefs are so deeply tied to their sense of identity, that that is terrifying and threatening uh, but if they'... but the thing is one group is right and one group is wrong, you don't have to just say both sides, no, one side is right, the other side is wrong, but uh, though side that's right in this case might not be right enough to recognize how right they are, and therefore doesn't have the confidence uh and emotional uh endurance to really think through everything they believe, so Anyway, so I said what I said, and I've kind of boiled it down to a little drawing I want to put here, so this is this is me trying to divorce my critique of Nathan Robinson's dismissal of Marx without any personal invective, without any any slant towards uh, towards the wetched adhamanim or anything else. This is purely trying to contextualize the dispute. and I'm going to use a piece of paper here to try to get it across, because I will not, like I said, I really don't want to look like a crazy person, and I know grap, putting out a graph doesn't necessarily help you uh relieve your mind on that case, but I just going to see if it's helpful for me, so we've got two firmaments here. This is broad and these categories suppresss other categories that are more complicated, but they're not necessary, you guys can see this, all right, so there's here's the world as it is, this is the world we live in, it sucks, we hate it, we recognize that it's bad because we're alienated from our time and our labor, that makes things shitty, that makes us want to die, but also afraid of dying, got up here, socialism, let's say, broadly construed because we're trying to do big tent, we're going to take good on good faith, everybody's claim that they are a socialist when they say they are, so Nathan Robinson, I believe he's a socialist, okay, because he wants this, I believe, because why, I can't, how will I ever prove he isn't to anyone satisfaction, it'd be impossible, you're asking me to like dissect his soul, all we can say is: does he act as though he wants socialism and it seems as though he does, but he's lives down here, we all live down here, and we all have to build a bridge, first through thought, then through action, practice, that is then collectively endeavored towards the goal, if you get enough people pushing in the same direction, you can get here, but they all have to be doing it together, that's cooperation, that's socialism, that's communism, that's everything. Okay, so that's what, so the thing is, how do you get it, what's the engine, what's the thought engine that drives this from is to should be, okay? I would say that Marx, because he emerged at the moment that capitalism emerged, that's not a coincidence, he was historically contingent. Marx emerged when he did, because he was seeing the beginning of capitalism. he grased all of its contours and so that is why his analysis of capitalism is the single most important one, it doesn't mean he was right about everything, it doesn't even mean he was right on on balance in some way, every most things, it means he was right on the most basic things that you build from, because you can say, well marx didn't anticipate uh ecology and marx didn't anticipate feminism or marx didn't anticipate racism, marx didn't anticipate a technological advancement, Marx didn't anticipate like how far imperialism would extend uh capitalism's ability to expand market uh and and increase inputs, yeah because he died in 1881, he he could only observe he could create models and then observe them at play out reality only in front of them, we have to add on, but we add starting with the Marks and what Mathan Robinson is saying essentially is replace marks. with me, because if it's not Mark's then who is it? well, it's got to the guy, guy tells you to discard marks, and you're starting from scratch and trying to figure out how to get from here to here. "you have no road map, who are you going to trust more than the guy that just told you to give away the foundational guy of the whole thing, the foundational set of ideas, and I'm saying that because Nathan Robinson exists so far away from the big bang of capitalism, that he is such a liberal subject as we all are, he is so suffused with the liberalism that is redounded through the cultural." structure over the last 200 years that his insights will not go as deep as Mark's were because he was there at the temporal beginning, he wasn't captured by the ideology of capitalism yet because he hadn't grown up under it. Nathan Robinson is captured as I am, as everyone reading this is by the ideology of capitalism, so we all have to come together and take everything that came before us and everything that we see around us to build enough to counteract that. ideology and you start with something like Marx, you cannot start with nothing cuz then you are in thin air, you are a late capitalist subject trying to bootstrap yourself into a third into a into an observational point of view of capitalism that you cannot have because you're inside of it, it's heisenberg's uncertainty principle, you are in capitalism, you're embedded in it, you cannot uh be outside of it to see where you are, but Marx could, because he didn't grow up under it, and that's why he is so disastrously wrong to say that we shouldn't have had marks, because that means that those things still would have come up, those insights would still be there, people would still articulate them, but they would have articulated them later, which would have meant they would have articulated them with less specificity, and it would have been harder to build on them, it would be literally retarding progress, because it retards the dialectic, because marxism emerges to come into conflict with the reality of capitalism and create new realities, that's the dialectic history, and it's like, I didn't get it for a long time, I assumed it was right, because I assume I agreed with other parts of Marx, I was like, I agree with all the stuff about Marx about like class struggle, I see it's clearly true, I'm not so sure about the dialectic, so I will just say I agree with that part, problem is that means I don't really believe in marxism that. much because i can't justify it beyond that level that leaves me vulnerable, that leads me feeling insecure about it, and when you reach that point, there are two things to do, you can either say, well marx is wrong, or you can say, i'm going to try to figure it out, why do i believe this, why, what principles does class struggle come from, and that's where you get to the basic stuff like historical materialism. and then on top of that dialectical materialism, like first the observation, the observation of the material conditions, and then the notion that they are driven by conflict between ideas, which is then turned at the higher level into class struggle, there's class struggle, they're all built on top of one another, now we're stuck here because intervening... check now this is where marx dies basically, marx dies here, now we've got this time here, we have intervening time, we have new technology, we have empire, we have the world wars, we have all this stuff, but we still have to get there, and marks can't help us anymore, so now what do we do, we build on top of this with other stuff, stuff about ecology, stuff about race, stuff about gender, uh, stuff about technology, stuff about computers, uh, all that stuff, you add it on top, you add it on top of the base here. Now what Nathan Robinson is doing by rejecting this stuff because he didn't understand it and didn't either have the patience or brains to study it until he did, rejects it and says, it must not be true because I don't understand it. No, you don't understand it, and to you, therefore it isn't true. If you understood it, you could reject it and say, no, this entire premise is wrong, but it flows to every. other principle you're talking about, it flows, the dialectic flows all the way up from historical materialism to dialectal materialism to the class struggle, it all flows up towards a state of actual existing socialism for all humankind, the actual end point of teleological uh uh marxism, if you say no to that, what you're basing it on, like you're basically basing it on liberal concepts of uh morality, now if you're off here. 'if you're Nathan Robinson, you're going off, and you know where this is, you know what that arrow is up there, that arrow is liberal personal individualism, because that's what that's what like anarchism is, As Chomsky has admitted, anarchist traditions and things of that nature exist to try to get the socialism, try to get the socialism without a basis of materialism, and what they do instead is they say, well we are morally required to create a just society, because we all are individual beings with individual rights, but that creates the only way to adjudicate the idea of us all being monads like that is through market trans actions which necessitates capitalism, so it creates liberal subjects, and now liberal subjects, if they're given enough time and resources might get to socialism, but given the constraints of resources on a planet over time, that will likely lead to destruction before it gets to socialism, and guess what, it'll eventually pass to the stage of of understand, it will eventually resolve to a point where it incorporates marxism, but it'll be. way way later and less effectively, it just started raining, uh, no, I'm not, I don't mean, I don't mean markets, I mean market transactions are the only transactions you can have, if the basis for your understanding of of of material reality is along individual uh, individual moral lines, the idea that we're all individuals with individual morality, like those things have... meaning that leads either to uh uh religious uh fundamentalism at which has to be overcome which is another obstacle uh or it leads uh to total atomization which only reinforces capitalism at every level all right god damn it it's raining through the slats here i'm getting rained on i'm getting dabbed on guys uh I might have to go inside all right uh guys we're going to be Oscar Mike here in a second uh watch watch your perimeter please don't doc anything you might see. hi guys, thank you for bearing with me during the treck there, i'm still on, it's raining out, are you guys doing now, now i can uh, all right, so that was what i was trying to say, i wanted to get that off of my chest. the Nathan Robinson thing, so uh, so anyway, so the thing to say then about him is, it means he's wrong, but then people say, well, does, like immediately when if you criticized him, I saw people saying, totally understandibly, you want to throw him out of the discourse, you think he's a fraud, you want to supplant him with your own identity, it's like, you're totally reasonable to worry about that, because that's what you should have come to expect from other people on this platform, because that's what uh behavior rewarded, so totally understand that uh, I'm just saying uh, so that's there's no way for me to like responsibly uh uh and successfully critique him on that platform without people taking it the wrong way, because that's the only way that they've been trained to take things there, so I am done, this is a long way of saying that I am done uh dunking on anyone on Twitter other than evil like you know goblins. I will not be uh, I will not be dunking on anyone's ideological uh uh uh disinclinations or uh or like ideological failings, I'll stick clearly to material goofamups, like uh people telling you about who to vote for and shit like that, because that is much more concrete, that you can argue and bat around, and it doesn't cause such deep semantic confusion is mucking around an important fucking theoretical shit and just turning it all into mush. just turning it all into a bunch of mush and that nobody understands, but everybody thinks they have to to maintain the ideologies and the identities that they have value now, like instead of creating their own identities they've grabbed one off the rack in the form of socialism or whatever all rightight anything, any kind of uh political identity online is a substitute for the identity that we can't create through uh like true use of our time because it's alienated uh so I'm done with all that, I will be uh, I will be using the inter uh, I'll be trying to rededicate to myself to only using Twitter for funds. just having fun uh uh you guys got any questions uh anybody got any questions? man i got to say it's kind of funny to imagine this many people listening to this i'm a little worried that i'm that i'm rendering myself uh a laughing stock uh of the uh of the new web intelligentia with this i'm a little worried anything but got wrong, he got wrong at a higher degree of uh abstraction from reality than everything else, he got wrong the way that all good thinkers get wrong in one direction, you you're building on a base, all all thought, all belief, all everything is built on a base, and that's the engine, uh, and so the things he got wrong were at the edges. like a question like the declining rate of profit, that really is something that he couldn't totally predict, because a lot of it have to do with exigencies that he wouldn't have been able to uh conceive of because he didn't realize what technology was going to do, like he and he couldn't have because he was he was fixed in the space time of the late 1900s, so that's a thing that he might be wrong about. now a lot of people crisis theory say no, he's 100% right of the creat la the uh the the declining rate of profit, and the thing is: I think that he is right in the broad sense that that will happen just due to the reality of, I mean, I don't understand how anyone can deny that the how do you deny the declining, the the the tendency of the rate of profit to decline over time, and the second law of therbodynamics, how can you believe, how can you not believe both of those, they're expressions of the same reality, they're expressions of the same underlying uh function of matter over time, which is to lose energy, lose lose. uh uh uh lose in translation and lose over transmission, so it's banally true that the so when people say he was wrong, what they mean was it didn't happen on a time scale that he predicted, well no shit, he was fucking guessing on what was going to happen, he didn't realize the extent to which colonialism would extend uh the the livestime of the super prophets of capitalism, like as and then lenin had to point that out because fucking marx was dead, he wasn't going to understand what technology he was going to do in terms of like destroying a lot of presumptions about like malthusian limits uh those are all mistakes but they're just mistakes of not having enough information his basic methodological approach to reality was correct, but now we have to refine it because things have happened since then and we're responding to a different reality, a fundamental different reality than the one he was describing, it's a different world, and we don't think of it that way because we don't think of our place of ourselves. is fixed in place and time in relationship to other things. all right, you guys got any questions? labor theory of value is another one of those ones where declining rate of profit where it's like that's so true, it's banally true, it's it's it's implicit in existence. labor. is value, they're they're the same thing, labor, labor is value the same way the time is space, they occupy the same, they occupy the same space time quadrant at any given moment, you cannot have one without the other in equal measure, so what the fuck are you even talking about, all that marginal evolution shit is at a higher level of abstraction that's gone off kilter because now you're trying to reinforce capitalism instead of move towards trans which is what we should be doing, yeah, see people like uh, diamonds and water, dude, rope, nope, nope, higher level of abstraction, at a higher level of abstraction, yeah, you can find value in things that aren't directly tied to labor, but that's because they've been abstracted away from the fundamental relationship, which is just value and labor. Chomsky, God bless him, is a liberal, and he says he is, which is why I don't understand anarchists to get mad when you point that out, anarchism is liberalism, it is a higher stage of liberalism, anarchism is like the highest stage you can get of liberalism towards justice, before it breaks down due to its internal contradictions, so it is more advanced than liberalism, it is a form of liberalism, that's the thing is that these anarchism is a superior and more progressive form of liberalism, but it comes from liberalism, and because of liberalism is now just a slur and a slander that you throw on people you don't like on twitter, to show that you're to the left, like why does everyone call everybody liberal, because then they're not part of the left and that means you are, and people should pay attention to you, because you're not a liberal, because everyone understands that a liberal is out of the club, so instead of cuuse like anarchist could that except like oh, a liberal and maybe they'll find, you know what, I actually am a liberal, and then they're good, I am a liberal anarchist, but they insist on saying, no, I am, I'm I'm a fucking socialist, and it just confuses everything, because they have to be on the left, they have to be liberal a socialists to be good, because the reason all these political opinions matter so much to us is because of how little we use them, because how much they are just in our heads, if we live them every day, we they would be secure and we wouldn't have to reify them by having them reinforced by going on twitter and having people tell us that we're good socialists. if we lived as good socialists we wouldn't need to be told so we wouldn't have to go online and be socialists, and then we wouldn't have to be so touchi about who gets to call them that and we could actually examine the fucking questions on their merits instead of failing to understand the terrain of the argument. because you need all of these people, like people say, oh, you're saying you're not socialist, that doesn't mean you're bad necessarily, it means that you're you're carrying out your role, everyone is not going to just change because all right, i honestly think that the big fundamental problem here is that people who put their internet, the the underlying theory of activism that underlies you going online right and saying your opinions, if you strip it of everything else and all self-dealing and all like all the stuff about you know wanting to uh uh make friends or whatever or influence people and you just strip it to the actual original because there was at one point before it got muddled there was a real desire to do good when you're seeing the shitty world and if you could strip it down to that what would it be? it would be, i want to go online to tell people what to do, the idea is i will say: "this is what you should believe, and by making people believe it, then they're going to do it, but look what happens, we say that, and then what does it convince other people to do? it convinces other people to do what we did, which is just say what we are, if you were out doing it, and I'm saying, I'm including myself in this, oh my god, do not think that I don't understand that I am more implicated by this than any single person on earth." that i am more an example of this rotten failed system, the the more a curse of the demo urge, i understand that, i absolutely do, i i don't know if i can do enough penance for it uh to to gain credibility that i actually do believe that, but trust me man, i do, i get it. Anyway, anybody got any questions? anybody seen any good movies lately? these things move so fast, it's hard for me to say. Yeah, I kind of, I mean, that's what I'm working towards, it's like a unified field theory. Um, once again, I don't want to sound insane, but I'm going to try to lay out here the basic principle, this is like the thing that I would put on uh, I would put on like a belt buckle or on a welcome mat or uh, like have... on a sampler, just the thing to remember every day to help me like think better, and uh, you guys can tell me, I'm crazy or not, uh, it's that the degree to which a being has consciousness, because consciousness comes in degrees, the degree to which beings have consciousness, is the degree to which they can perceive time. All right, so that's all I'm going to say about that now, I'm going to try to talk more about this stuff in the future, uh, yeah, if I feel if you feel like I've gone around the ben, please let me know. because I'm going to just like kind of take a the only way I can know how I'm doing with this in terms of getting it across, I know I'm right but I don't know if I'm getting it across is if people come back and tell me dude you're doing good or dude you sound insane uh because then I need to know that I need to spend more time on refining my translations uh so that they don't sound crazy okay someone says I sound insane oh no. a lot of people are so you got a lot of got can we get a you sound insane in the in the in the chat can you can you get a little you sound insane - yeah that's the thing is i don't want to be the time cube guy bause the time cube guy i don't think he was very happy i don't think he felt like he was getting it across maybe he was maybe the timeec guy was ultimately happy because he thought had done enough of a job, and maybe it is, because maybe that means that there's one person in the world who will read timecube and become instantly enlightened at the end of it, that could happen, and if he did it to one person, he succeeded, so that means timecube guy was right, so tip of the half the time cube guy. the implications of my theory are absolutely universal, but I can't predict what they are, because they will only appear in the actual moment of use, because that is when the dialect kicks in, buse that is, buse like that's what really hit me about the dialectic is that dialectical reasoning is the literal engine of... all uh existence, it's how the brain comes into consciousness and how the uh literally the universe comes into consciousness of itself, if this is acid communism, I mean I took acid before I thought it up, and it's still, it's making me a much more, much better, more confident, uh, more nuanced communist, I say yes, I'll call it as of communism. now because I feel like I am finally for the first time confident that I could even call myself something like that, before I assuwed labels because I didn't even know what I believed, I only know what I kind of thought was true, and I never pursued it deeply enough, and I have been because I didn't have a way to do so, because you are not taught to think, you are taught to react, and those aren't the same thing, uh, and because you're only taught to react, and if you only react, you will be an animal, you will be a miserable. creature too conscious of time uh to enjoy life in like blissful unawareness of your own mortality um but without any ability to enjoy to enjoy that sense yeah like i mean the reason i was on all about battle call sall last week is that. i remember trying to write a think piece about um about prestige tv for a while, it was like one of my opinions, you know, like one of those little hip pocket things that was contrarian enough to gain notice and make you worth listening to, because hey, i'm saying something slightly different than what everyone else is saying, this is on just like a cultural level rather than a political one, but the same thing happens in politics uh, and then i had to like back fill it in with with what i had observed. uh prestige tv, which is that it was like this weird set of genre expectations uh and I was able to only get to like this thing about how well we like it because uh we're too tired to read books anymore but I couldn't like get to like why that is tech that actually is tragic and now I actually get to stand it it's not that the form it's not that the uh the it's not that oh these shows aren't as good as the Sopranos it's that even the Sopranos is a degraded version of art. that should not have been that universally beloved because it was on television, because it was the product of of a capitalist enterprise, it was as tainted as the attempt to build socialism on twitter is, the artistic impulse, the impulse towards morality, those impulses are tainted by their association with the markets, and I couldn't get to that root of it, so I ended up being more, very superficial, and the thing I wrote for current affairs, hilariously, that I wrote about Prestige TV. now I feel like I didn't really get across what I was trying to say because I didn't really know why I was saying it and now I get it because I have applied dialectical reasoning to it. It's like a mental Ginsu knife, see here's the thing, I can't do math, so I can't do any of this math stuff, I have to try to enrich my understanding of this in the symbolic languages that I'm adept at, which are words and then symbols related to words, I have one of the most bifricated minds on in human history uh like the way I see it, math is the symbolic language of the material world, uh, the intellect, and uh, words are the symbolic, representation of the spiritual, the emotional, the empathic, and I'm very good at those, but I'm very, very bad with math, and you can prove things in both ways, uh, but I can only... persuaded by ones that i can understand and i cannot understand math based proofs, so i have to try to like find other word symbolic regimens, semiotics to build my uh, to build my confidence in this one, because i'm only going to keep believing this and having this inform my behavior for the better if i keep believing it, and that's only going to happen if other people reflect it back to me. otherwise known as karma, this is also basically buddhism by the way, uh, it's all just like, I'm trying to speak of Buddhism in a materialistic sense, but yeah, like you step one mac and this is buddhism, so spoiler alert, and the thing is, it's also mystic christianity, whatever, it all ends up with a communion with the god head, which is time, which is perception of time, it's just different vocabularies, different. yes everything is caused by everything else, there is total determinism of all acts in the universe, but we all in in the moment are fully free to do anything, and the funny thing is is like, a lot of this stuff people say. Esher whatever or Schopenhauer, these are all things that I have never read, I'll admit it, because honestly the main reason I I never read any a lot of the really like heavy theory stuff is that the level of dialogue I would have with my friends and with people online was never deep enough to require it, so there was never a motivation on my part to actually deep dig into it, because there was no suggestion that there was... anything deeper, and now I feel like I understand the the use, I understand like where these things fit, and I feel like for first that makes me think, oh, no, now I never have to read them, but what it really means is now I have to read them all, because reading them reinforces them, both in my mind and then in my actions, which then reverberate out to everybody else, and then they bring them back to me. I don't know anything. about math, that's the fibonacci thing is kind of a joke. yeah, and the first book that came along that made me think of that was Ulysses. i felt like oh, i feel like Ulysses is a part of that, as an attempt to build a consciousness out of words, to to use symbol, the the the symbols of uh language so finally that you have rendered a mind. so yeah, i'll try that. i'll try goodle. uh Allan Watt apparently uh, I would love to read some, I love to read some Christian mysticism now, uh, now that I've to feel like I can totally grapple with all uh, religious traditions, uh, and of course Buddhism. Yeah, because existentialism is like part of this, like this is an edifice of different things driven through different uh periods of time that reflect that reflects certain truths that we can then build on, uh, and I think existentialism points towards that, buddhism points towards it, nosticism before them, they all got at different points of the root of the change. buse like... for other people, why would you ever do that? it doesn't make rational sense, you have to put it off, one of the things help you put it off is empathy for others, because that gives you an investment in their happiness, because it makes you happy, but the other is knowledge that it will do good for you too, that it's not just altruism, like that's why like libertarianism, like rand is half of it, but the thing is if you follow rand. you die in the desert, because there's nobody else, and nobody, you don't even have a language to understand yourself as you die, because it denies the social, but it understands that there is an individual will that has an individual desire, but it must be tied to uh, a collective will that leads towards a collective happiness because you have intellect and empathy in equal measures, or in unequal measures depending on your person uh, what your personal like admixture of experiences is. so that means that you have uh, so you have an individual will and you need to have a reason to want to do things, not just for other people, because that'll get exhausting eventually, you'll get sick of it, you have to want to do it because it's good for you too, if you just do things that are good for you, you become alone and then miserable, but the so the way to square that is to you need to be doing things that m make both things true, make things good for others and good for yourself. and that means you have to both see things being done good to others and also know that you're making yourself better, so you have to believe it, you have to, it has to be convincing, so that is why you have to every day believe things, and that is perceiving time, that will make you do things that make you do it more, and that will make you do it more, and it will allow you to get to the top of Sisifis's mountain, which is ego death. which is a a oneness with the universe, which is also, if we do it right, going to heaven when you die, as opposed to going to hell when you die, which is the fear and terror, as darkness descends on you, because you don't recognize any time, instead of times infinites. all right, so what do you guys think? what is i don't i uh i realize as i said do i sound crazy that once again i'm screwing up the symbolic order if i want to get good in feedback i can't ask binary questions these are all on gradients so if you guys could give me a percentage sort of like you now you can go to the you go to the grocery store and you get the 9010 uh uh uh uh lean to fat ground beef and then you can get like if it's a little richer you get like the 85 and you can get the like the really lean like the 991 what percentage of in non insane am i sounding like how how how uh how marbled with insanity is my uh is my legibility all right i'm getting a lot of numbers here some very low ones couple of pretty good ones, see the thing is, i don't know which ones of you are joking, i don't know which ones of you are giving me the business, so i can't really take these as true, i got to say very surprised at how few said 69, there it is, nice, nice, all right, that's okay, well like i said, i'm going to try to live it every day uh and have it come back to me in the form of a greater understanding of it that i can make easier to articulate, but like I said, if it stops making sense, I'm going to have to confront that, and I'm going to have to confront where I went wrong, because I went wrong somewhere, maybe not yet, but I will in the future, it's inevitable, I will go wrong somewhere if I haven't already, and if I have, I got to find it, it's my duty, to myself and everyone else, because it's the same, there's no conflict. uh, I have more viewers than Sasha Grey, that's very funny. What is she doing? Is she gaming? Who's gaming? Thank you for the subscription. Hey, so you guys uh, so I don't really do a lot twitch thing a lot, this is I'm new to it, this is only my second one on the on here, what is uh, so you guys when you buy it, when you subscribe, that gives you... the ability to do some cool uh uh what do you call it uh emotes right so what how many guys i guess this is just an intelligence for me since i haven't asked i haven't been out here before what uh how many emotes are there for me? how many emotes? how many kush emotes are there? okay, i got a sleepy guy with my hat on for when i got really drunk, it looks like there's just one, they don't have a joker one, that's too bad. uh, are there any erotic emotes? got any horny emotes out there? where is the horny emotes? Well all right uh oh it's about it's been about an hour and I'm trying to keep it around there because uh I don't know when the boys want to start streaming again uh so but I'll take a probably a few questions before I hang up here if anyone's got anything. Am I still jokerified? I have now transcended jokerification. Jokerirification was a stage. I have transcended the joker stage. I have emerged from my joker pupa. Uh, first I was riddlerfied. Uh, I might be penguinfied right now. I suspect I'm penguinfied. Can I get a penguinfied in the chat? Ah, Terry Eagleton, I have read, he's very good. Uh, I think I really wish we had more nuclear energy, uh, really, really wish that for chernobil, it hadn't happened, uh, we really went off the we really fucked up by not doing uh, more nuclear energy, uh, I don't know if it's too late or not though to do it at this point, but it was definitely a wrong turn. because like it's so labor intensive and it's so capital intensive to make nuclear plants now, it's like even though it is a green technology and it's definitely worth it, is it going to be worth the opportunity cost to for resources you could have used elsewhere i'm not sure what the balance is, i just know it would be a lot easier if we had a lot more working nuclear plants right now uh i was on the north fork of long Island last a couple years ago and I drove by what looked like a 60's style uh nuclear uh reactor and I went over and I like I I took a picture of it and I found it online and yeah there's a nuclear reactor that was put that was built on the North Forkalong Island in the 80s and it was going to power that area and then fucking three-mile island happened while they were still trying to put it together and the local office. in all the towns got together and said that they weren't going to sign off on a necessary disaster plan to deal with the potential for uh a problem and so he never put it online the thing cost billions of dollars and it's just sitting there and it's just god damn it's such a missed opportunity mainly because the people who needed to know how direly dangerous carbon emissions were going to be worn aware yet most of the people who knew were fucking uh employed by the goddamn oil companies. all right, i got to go guys, this has been a lot of fun, we'll do it tomorrow, uh, once again, let me know how i'm doing, i need to keep, i need to stay above 50/50, i know that, that's my goal, 55 and above, that'll be my slogan, 55 and up, bye-bye.
