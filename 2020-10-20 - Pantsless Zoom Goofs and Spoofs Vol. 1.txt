 I need to let go, you know, you know, no, you don't, you don't want to shine on through the hearts of man, I want to reach out. I want to say, I want to let go, no, you don't, you don't, I want to shine, in the hearts of man, I want to reach out with the back of my broken hand, another headache, another heartbreak, I'm so much older than I can take, reflection, well it comes and goes. goes I need direction to perfection now help me out here we go hi guys we back on the case how goes it out there in Twitchland I hope it's going well I hope everyone's ready for the second of a turns out two presidential debates got to say I'm excited now that I've pushed through to the other. side of the looking looking glass uh and especially after i watched them both simultaneously uh during the town hall last week which actually ended up being way less jarring and discombobulating than the first debate because one i had a bunch of other co-hoos talking so that added you know cognitive uh distortions but just the fact that they were talking like at the same time but about without being aware of it, like without you know challenging one another, it really uh, it gave it sort of like a soothing um, like symphonic quality, because I was able to sort of tune, pay attention to one or the other, like I'd hear both, but if I looked at one of them, I could hear them more directly, and the other one kind of fell into the background, and so I could kind of pick my pick, I could turn into a Pixy song, and I could go for a nice like, like a nice a minute or so just listening to Joe, just this soft, grandfatherly senence of of of Joe, just sounding like he's talking himself into uh, into dreamland, sounds like he's getting he's waiting, it sounds like he's waiting to get the Edward G Robinson treatment from Soilent Green, and that's soothing, but you know it's could get, it would get boring if I listen to the whole thing, so then I just look at Trump and he's screaming at Samantha Guthry about how we have to. test, we're doing the best, we have the best test, we have more tests than anybody at the and China, no, and it's like, boom, they it's like loud quiet, loud, and then you go back after that becomes too taxing and you go back to biden, it's like soothing again, with them you actually talking to each other and having like one conversation, I think it's going to be uh, honestly more challenging to keep Zen, but I think with my last couple of experiences, I've learned to just absorb the gastalt, just... or sort of the noises, the sounds, yeah, like, like a symphony, like like their voices are just instruments for aesthetic appreciation, they do not exist to communicate uh, ideas or facts or policy or anything, is there a more fail world leader in his? That's an interesting question, because on the one hand, Mussolini is one of the great political entrepreneurs of the modern era, this is a guy who saw the writing on the wall in World War One, saw it as the deathnell for like marxian socialism as a meaningful political current, or at least a political current that could realistically take power uh in Europe after World War II, because they sure'. were headged towards that point when world war one happened and shattered everything uh as we talked about before on on the streams, but a lot of socialists were left after world war ii very bereft of like an understanding of how to move forward and you saw them fall to bloody uh internal mayham and Germany and elsewhere because no one knew what to do, especially after the soviets won, but uh Mussolini looked at what was happening, said what do we got here, we've got... left wing that's got this massive popular base, but is existentially feared by the powers of being in our society, and as we just saw, they're willing to do almost anything to prevent. the uh the left wing from taking power, including destroying Europe. here we are, but what we got on the right? we've got a right wing uh movement that has obviously or a reactionary you know power base that has control of all the power within the society, but has basically no popular uh support among actual people, which in the modern era in the new 20th century era of mass politics is now necessary, so Mussolini said, well we'll take the shit that gets people in the streets for the left and we'll just do it for the right, and in so doing he created an entire, he helped create and he wasn't the only one that did it, but he was the most, he was the first one, and and Hitler was slavishly uh, fixated on what Mussolini was doing, and the the bear pushed was inspired by the march on Rome, he thought that the the nazis were in a position similar to what the black shirts were uh in 22 when uh they'... on rome and and and Mussolini was just given control of government by a cowed uh house of savoy and it failed miserably they got the cops shot him and uh he went to jail obviously not for too long but anyway like that was a hell of an insight that was a hell of a uh move you know he's kind of like a ray crock figure of politics uh and i say all that in with those terms because fascism needs to be understood first and formost as this incredibly cynical att to create something that will work, it was a, it was a, it was a uh, a brand, it was a, it was a um, it were people, it was a group of people in search of power uh, who had branding that they knew worked, like what the kind of stuff that had emerged out of the... push for socialism in Europe had created like this uh this thing that the public at large understood to mean opposition to the status quo and opposition to the powers that be and the idea of a new and better world than the one we had, a progressive one uh and he pulled what worked out of that and put it out there uh to prop up capitalism basically not the old rulers, not the old people who ran capitalism necessarily, but but capital and which meant that they got uh they were able to draw large numbers of people into their organization with the promise of redemptive violence, which people love, but without having to worry about really getting any kind of pushback from power, in fact getting supported by power, getting huge checks, huge uh, wheel barrels of lera from the big land owners and the budding capitalists to break. and and uh stop agricultural work stoppages and it got him into power almost immediately, like look how long it took Hitler to get his shit together, Italy took power almost immediately 1922, that's impressive, but then the problem with fascism is that it really does, it's predicated on imperial expansion, it's predicated on uh on expanding its internal market through domination. of new territory and new resources uh because of its resistance to the subsumption and any kind of like uh global network power, like it it's it's a uh it's a philosophy of national supremacy which meant that for Italy and uh I mean I don't think it's a coincidence Italy and Germany were the countries that had fascism and they were also the countries that missed out because they weren't uh they were late in being formed. as nation states, as coherent nation states, they lost out on all the imperial spoils that had allowed capitalism to extend itself and extend its capacity beyond like the the locations of its original founding, but if they were going to maintain capitalism is the engine of the economy uh and resist the sort of corporate of a like naked capital domination that leads to uh uh the social atomization. and uh that you see in the in like the advanced capitalist countries, so rather than do that, rather than strip that national character, you got to grab some of that territory, and when they tried to do that, it didn't go very well. Ethiopia was honestly harder than it should have been, considering what the Ethiopian military was capable of, and they still use poison gas and shit, uh, and then.... everything during World War II really, everything during World War II. He honestly might have helped save the Soviet Union because operation Barbarossa had to be... uh postponed uh because when it was originally supposed to happen because against uh Hitler's please uh Mussolini invaded Greece after taking Albania and in so doing got his ass kicked so bad that Greeks were actually taking back parts of Albania and so they had to divert forces to to invade and and and uh conquer the Greeks, which throw the time table off, and then yeah, overthrown, taken away by Otto Skursni to live in Salo, to where he presumably ate poop according to that movie, then caught in the roadway, shot by uh firing squad, hung up by his ankles at a gas station, that's pretty fail, that's pretty fail, but the only reason I can't give him a full fail grade is because he really was a guy who came from nowhere you know I think one of the definitions of fail for me that's most important is that a lot of it comes with just being of the generation that comes that later the generation that's had it happened or for them already the ones who are supposed the ones who are given the position of someone who has a massed a huge fortune or huge amount of power in the world but then none had developed none of the traits that the person who had uh developed in the course of getting it, you know what I mean, like the things that the things that help you get somewhere are the things that help you stay there, and he didn't, and these guys a fail person to me is someone who got the position, but had none of anything that uh, like makes you worthy of the role, you know, in any meaningful sense, obviously, you know, we're talking about cap, even in capitalism, there is still a role for like... skill and ability, and that's what capitalist like to point to is the thing that we're trying to reward with this system, but it's very, very small, what we mostly reward, what is vastly, vastly over rewarded is luck, and not just like the luck to not have a brick fall on your head or you, get cancer or something, which is part of it or get disabled in a specific way, uh, that's all part of the luck, but the big part of the luck is being born into a position of already uh of already having assumed power, and we're being. right now by the copies of the copies of the copies built this liberal meritocratic system and so they have none of this the the abilities that are developed and chosen for through like the theoretical uh competitive architecture of capitalism or politics so I think anybody who is really fail they have to have in some respect respect, some significant respect, fumble the ball, drop the bag, and hit and Mussolini fucking made the bag in the first place, uh, fargo. people are asking about fargo uh, five episodes in, very poor in my opinion, very bad show, uh, just the it's blunt, it's obvious in a way that it didn't used to be, like i kind of got bored with the way it would create these thematic and symbolic uh presence to be opened by reviewers, but i now realize that i kind of miss that compared to the just lack of any subtext, and i think that's because they're trying to address a social issue, which is not, I mean the whole point of fargo right, it's supposed to be a riff on the cons and the con universe and the con worldview and the conesthetic right, and I'm sorry, but that's not a big feature of it, is like social awareness, you know, that's not really what they are interested in, and a a movie and a series of shows that like don't really make sense honestly outside of that context, that's a reason that's called that, there's a reason that they have all these like the... and the settings and even the characters, they're all established by coin brothers archetypes and now they're making a season that's about like the realities of races it's lived in america and i'm sorry that's not something the cohen have ever really cared about and as a result you see just like the term paper mindset kick in where it's like we're going to give everybody a monologue about racism every episode which is not something that the previous seasons had. but i will say like i don't think this is some huge drop in quality cuz fargo was always like clever but not fantastic just because was so so you know fixated on like appealing to you know an idea of quality and now i think the thing about this season is is like now that element like having to have a racial or like a social awareness element to the plot i think that's now here not just as like some pander but because or not like a direct pander to like oh people are woke now let's give them something that's woke but just you know if the show really does seem to be in some way being driven uh by like the the idea of what the critical response will be, then now I think in this current moment everyone is aware that the new critical consensus has that like for a real work of art to mean anything in the popular culture, it has to speak to these questions, and if it doesn't it is inferior, and I just don't think that's true, I disagree with that premise. cabinet uh somebody want uh biden cabinet uh predictions, I'm going to go the grimise for secretary of state, uh, I know you're going to think uh, Hamburgler at treasury, no, thank you, Hamburgler at defense, no, I honestly don't get why people get w riled up about uh, any of the cabinet stuff, one, it's all just being leaked by specific staffers to make a like to do some. internal office politics bullshit, the way people read shit like that and just assume oh this is like the campaign telling us the truth as opposed to this is some weazele in the campaign trying to position themselves for the post campaign era and you know that doesn't mean that it's not true and it certainly wouldn't be surprising, but it's also not something that one, first of all we can even no means anything other than office politics and people chocking for position, which I mean tells you something, but two. "it doesn't fucking matter who's in the cabinet, it doesn't matter who's in the cabinet, we know how this fucking government will be run, we know because we actually saw a primary contest that had like meaningful stakes and the party destroyed a number of its presiding uh institutional concepts from me too to the Iowa caucus and then killed their own fucking voters" you can't give them uh, you can't say that they're dumb like Trump when he denied the pandemic, they're the they're the party of science, right? they listen to doctors and they were telling people after the fucking lockdown started, go vote, don't worry about it, be a hero, do democracy, and if anyone said don't do it, they said, wow, uh, the sanders campaign bringing out the ugly history of uh voters voter intimidation and suppression uh harketing back to the days before the civil rights act when democratic uh when minority democrats were prevented from voting, and that's what Bernie Sanders and his gang of Bulls Connor are trying to do, like that was a fight, and like they didn't want Biden, I think it's pretty clear when you see how wide the field was and how long it took that the last thing they wanted was to have this fucking fossil on top of the ticket, but they had no other options because the party faithful, broadly construed didn't really have any. preference among the airs to the throne, because the democratic party has forgot how to appeal to actual voters, like look at what, look at what the democratic electorate, and these are people who are democrats, they accept so many of the premises of the Democratic party, they they're in fact basically inthrall to the Democratic party because they will vote the way they're told to, which is what they ended up doing, but when it's when they were forced to choose between a choice, like they basically got a lineup, the the MS uh the DNC basically said, here's your choice, it's who you want, and of course Bernie was off the table, Bernie had his supporters, Bernie had his chunk of the electorate and and you know he was working to try to expand that mostly through uh reaching out to non-voters, didn't work well enough, but that was the goal. Meanwhile, you've got regular democrats, these are the people who go in there and punch the ticket on the dems every four years, every two years, these are people who don't believe a lot of the uh you know right-wing uh uh American'. neigeric um slanders around the democrat party, like they don't think that they're eating babies, you know, they think that uh nafta might have bad some bad effects, but in general it made America better, you know like these people. are not even like Trump curious folks right, these are solid democrats and with presented with the next generation of people a next generation to assume the mantle of the Obama Clinton uh neoliberal democratic party, the DNC, the DLC mutant that emerged out of the 80s uh, and post and in this like in a in a post 2008 world, this is these are your options, Kamala, Buddhagej, Gilabrand, uh, Biden, whatever. all of the new ones, all of the ones that were supposed to be the fresh face uh were got no influence, no i mean no uh real interest, besides of course the freaks in Iowa, New Hampshire who specifically uh are fixated on the new and the fresh, basically they see themselves as like focus groups and they see give themselves the self-satisfaction and seriousness of purpose of a focus group, like okay, this is going to determine the next year's new flavor of M&M, i to make sure that it's a good one or like, oh my god, these chips, if they're bad, that's going to be my fault, like they think that way because of their first, everyone else is actually trying to think of like who they want to beat um, who they think could beat Trump and they'd actually like to see, and none of them caught fire at all, none of them got any real stick with any of those people, the only one who got any support was as a default Joe Biden because he was the one most directly connected to Obama, who they actually liked and they were really found for, the guy who was able to successfully mask neoliberalism with a uh like a a appeal not like just to black Americans but to like a whole segment of like college educated whites as well that uh that just disarm them to any of his faults and to the democratic party party not the democratic party's faults in general which they have you know fallen away from but from the democratic party and even though these are all people who like, oh, you know, they're all intersectional, they all know the language, they all know the language of this new, you know, wow capitalism, people talk about, that is the only thing that the democrats are standing for at this point, and no, none of them could gain traction, none of them could, and when it came down to uh to South Carolina, people say like Kleiburn uh chose the Klyburn sealed the fate. of uh Bernie and guaranteed it for Biden when he endorsed him uh I think I mean that's I think that's in a sense true but I don't think it's because Clyburn picked the democrats and said Biden I want him what happened was it was getting down to the wire none of the other people had any kind of uh support among his actual base in South Carolina he didn't want to go like outside the lane and pick somebody that he knew people didn't like who did people still like they still like Biden just give it to them. like that's what he knew that, he was connected enough to his own constituence to know that biden is the guy that people like because they think it relates to uh, they remind him of obama and they think that because they think he's a safe choice so you can win, and that's because they don't know his brain is gone like everyone in the Democratic party does, so Clyburn was forced, if I'm going to be if I'm, I'm either going to keep my mouth shut until election day and then I know then I've lost my power because who needs me for anything, or I'm going to ratify the decision of my... borders uh or my constituents by saying uh biden and then getting everybody in South Carolina to get rally around that which is what happened because South Carolina was not just huge margins in the black community, it was a huge surge in white suburban uh turnout for democratic primary, it was a revolution against Bernie, which until that point they had been stymied by the fact that none of these people look good, but didn't look good and for another reason for it's like different groups had different awarenesses of the different uh problems of the other candidates and so Biden was the last choice and I'm saying all this just to say they didn't do this for nothing, they did this to hold power. look at what they did with the fucking platform where they could have said anything cuz everyone knows the platform doesn't mean anything they still made sure there was nothing in the in the platform about universal healthcare or fucking Israel or anything, anything hot button, they didn't give the democrats any uh the ba the base, the leftists, the Berny Crats, they didn't give him anything because they didn't have to, they saw the measure of their opponent, the they were able to defeat them, which means they don't fear them anymore, which is why I keep saying there is no left uh stake in this election from the standpoint of like doing anything in a biden presidency. there is no pushing him left, there is no having them like somehow recognize the worth of having the left as a part of the coalition, the fight has been won has been lost at that point. like we're already in the aftermath of the defeat, like the Bernie was the effort, it was to hollow out the democratic party from within, like like one of those wasts to like bore into the head of a of like a a grasshopper or something and lay eggs, like if you want to vote for Biden, do it for whatever like harm reduction reason makes sense to you, even though none of that makes sense to me at all, i don't think we're. are we're reducing dick uh, but for god sake, don't do it thinking that the left has anything to do with it, and by the way, same thing goes for saying, no, I'm going to vote for, I'm not going to vote, or I'm going to vote for party, or I'm going to vote for Trump is the ultimate own, that's not going to matter either, because if you they lose, they're still in charge and they get to blame you for not coming out, if they win, they get to take you for granted again. but honestly i've been thinking about it and like the entire the entire liberal argument that they give used for making the left vote is in my opinion basically incoherent uh like from just some moral perspective tell me if you think this is crazy but uh like they say a vote for a vote. for anybody but Biden is essentially a vote for Trump and of course that only makes sense if the underlying assumption is that that person would be voting for Biden or should be voting for Biden and more importantly than should, because technically shouldn't everybody be voting for Biden, shouldn't even uh uh Trump supporters be voting for Biden? Why are only leftists the ones whose failure to vote for Biden is the is the cause for them to be the reason that he lost? It's because... they they say, no, no, but those Trump people, they they are b, they're either stupid or evil, you know better, but see, that's twining different types of knowledge into one thing, like the what they're referring to is the fact that you have a similar understanding to the liberal about you know the need for you, uh, things like anti-racism or uh, you know, civic equality, uh, economic egal. even because the liberal will insist that they're just as socialist as you, they just know it's realistic, and they say, we both want these things, you want those things, then by not voting for Biden, you are voting for Trump, but the thing is is that there's another level beyond just that common understanding, it's all right, we have these values, how do we enact them, and that is a tactical question that is separate from the question. of whether or not you have a similar understanding of what the political good is, how do you achieve it? that's the whole, that's the whole thing, that's the actual point of argument, and they allied it completely to assume it within the greater moral imperative for you to vote. and I would say that if you look at voting as it really is, not as we fantastically imagine it to be. is for you, not as a general thing, but as you as a person sitting in a voting booth, uh, what it is, is a expression of a preference for government, right? so if like you're saying the person has to vote, because like everyone should vote, basically the county imperative of do it, do what you want everyone to do, like in a political realm you should behave the way you want everyone to behave, and it's like yeah, then you want people to participate, buse otherwise then you just... have some sort of dictatorship, you have to, if people aren't going to participate in a punitive democracy, you don't have one, so yes, you should vote, but then you should vote, but then the next, but but within that is who are you voting for, because you are doing an an act of individual moral reasoning, you got to remember that, you're not coordinating activity, we pretend, we pretend that voting is a collective endeavor instead of 100 million individual ones, to allied this fact, but this is some fun like when reasoning about it if we're going if if i don't know what anyone else is going to do really beyond like maybe the circle of my close friends and like what i see in fucking polls then i just have to act from what i think should be done and so then the imperative is not to just vote it's to vote your conscience which means vote for you know a third party of your choice or write in somebody because if everyone roted for that person you'd have something good if everyone voted for who you're voting for then have a great outcome, i mean that's. and if anything that's an argument not to vote ironically to like if you're not going to vote for biden vote earnestly for a third party person if your choice or right in burny or something but it's not an argument about who to vote for that's separate that's about tactics and it's also about your understanding of what the parties mean and what biden's presidency would mean because there's plenty of there's plenty of evidence that a biden presidency will... you can't say like it's going to be not as bad as Trump in a broad sense, but once again like what does bad mean? uh, but it will definitely be a further development of terrible, terrible processes, it will not be interrupting, but rather accelerating the worst things that are happening in our political and economic system, and even there, you know, who to vote for is up to you, you got to thread that needle, but it's not this: open and shut case, because the open and shut case is buried down here in like the moral uh argument about like a a mutual understanding of like you know rights-based human humanity uh and equality, even though if you really are if if they really are d if they were really are a lib and someone really does have you know deeply felt socialist uh priors there are not even there's not even an agreement there because is the idea of what constitutes you know rights and freedom is different, but say at like that level, you know, not as deep as where the conflict begins and not as uh, shallow as where it comes back tactically, there's an agreement, but that's just like one thin slice of agreement, and they turn it into a moral imperative to go along with their horse shit, and i say, i just want to fucking... um, I just sound at this point I just want to see something funny happen. Trump talking about how he wanted to kiss all the guys for a couple days while he was jacked up on steroids, that was pretty fun, that was funny. someone says we need to stop moralizing about everything 24 hours a day. holy shit, if i see one fundamental flaw like beyond obviously the nature of online political argumentation, i would say that you know the specific expression of that, like the the the the category error that occurs that is generated by online argumentation and and like the the structures of it. is the constant turning of every question into a moral one, every question is is a question of like essence, like a good or bad, is this act good or bad, is this person good or bad? and of and those questions are unsolvable by definition, because unbenowns to the people making them, they're making them just to have something to do, their arguments that are made to be have. Who is the moralist favorite president? Jimmy fucking Carter, absolutely. Carter absolutely was a moralist first and foremost, a earnest one, I would argue that that Jimmy Carter like he has had a virtuous post war uh... post-presidential life, I would not argue that point at all, compared to the other ones, my god, it's not even close, and that kind of gives people this idea of like, well he couldn't have been that bad of a president, because he is a better man than most presidents, and the thing is, yes, he is a better man, I would say in some sort of soul measuring contest with the other presidents, he would win, but that very fact in the context of his presidency is what made him such a uniquely terrible president, because he was absorbing all of this essentially reaction and uh economic uh uh propaganda uh and turning it into like the firmament like the actual structure of reality and then reasoning morally from within that constraint which as president of the United States I'm sorry he should not be doing unless he wants to reify all of the worst emergent ideas within capitalism and the worst tendencies and he did what he did like try to bring about a recession on purpose. here somebody said uh uh that yeah that like well Volker did a lot of it with the with the interest rate hike and that wasn't you know that was just that's technically not Carter. because he's you know appointing somebody, first of all, that's bullshit, the federal reserve is just like the Supreme Court, it is a political institution that is designed to look like it's somehow independent of the political process and it's and and it's all a a uh a collectively agreed upon lie that we maintain in order to prop up the system, which is why John Roberts is the smartest republican on earth and why every de every republican who yells at John Roberts really proves that he is, well he's either playing to the base or he's a moron. because Roberts, for example, Roberts joined the liberals in a Pennsylvania case about a lower court ruling to uh stop the Republicans from preventing mail and ballots from going out uh three days before the present before the election and some de republicans are genuinely pissed about this, they do not understand or they don't want to understand or they don't care I guess that Roberts under Roberts understands that these things being perceived as independ. institutions is what maintains their uh their persistent power in American politics. If they did not have that, they would eventually be attacked by the political system. If everyone understood them, there was a collective understanding that these things were not independent of politics, if there was not a taboo against politicizing them, uh, they would be immediate, that's what the republicans are saying, we're going to get put more guys in the Supreme Court and then they're going to add guys to supreme court, like if you're me, I i go, who cares? so what, liberals, democrats understand that that's a genuine threat, that's scary, because if that were to happen, it would politicize the Supreme Court in a way that would render it no longer usable as a bock stop to prevent real you know left-wing government control or exercision of control, because you you can't point to the ref and say, it's not me, it's the ref, if the ref is lost his, if the ref is understood to be Tim Donigy, for example, and so Roberts understands that if the court's going to be around to do things like stop a green new deal from happening with the uh legislation or more likely than anything uh prevent universal healthcare from coming into being uh or just like further stripping voting rights away especially if the left becomes ascendent uh that's only going to be possible if there's if if the if there's enough un uh there's enough political cost associated with attacking the Supreme Court to prevent it from being carried out, or more importantly to prevent the base from demanding it be carried out, like right now the thing that allows democrats to play uh possum with the demo the Supreme Court uh is the knowledge that there's really nothing their base is going to do about it, they don't fucking care uh they or more importantly, even though they hate are horribly angry and awful and feel terrible about this, well they have absorbed the democratic ideology. that there's nothing to be done because the Supreme Court has to be protected from from politicization. If that perception goes away, it becomes inevitable over time that there will be pressing, there will be pressure on the court as an institution, and he wants to prevent that from happening, and doing things like joining the liberals, especially on things that they really care about, and right now what they care about more than anything is making sure that this election is not turn into 2000 again, that's buying him good boy points for the next rule. but anyway this is all big degression to say that carter thought he was reasoning in this reality that was actually a pseudo reality that was being projected to him by this new post Kansian austerity economics that said that the thing that was driving that the only way to solve inflation and to get the economy back on track was to break the back of working class power rather and and essentially end the continual rise of the workers labor ship. air of uh of now dwindling profits instead of i don't know taking those profits from the uh ownership side that wasn't on the table and so when he told people wear a sweater and you know turn down the thermostat and we're going to stop you from being able to fucking um borrow money like i was this is what i was saying when i was talking about the vulker shock it wasn't just volker he wasn't just applying vulker it was um "it was doing, he didn't do wage and price controls, he did credit controls, where in the second half of his uh term, he reduced the amount of money that could be lent to people at the retail level, that's the kind of thing that will basically force a recession to happen, they were doing it on purpose, and he was doing it out of virtue, he was going to win America off excess on behalf of virtue, not capitalism, but virtue. So yeah, moral questions at this point. what is the point of other than entertainment? how about some questions of affacy? how about some, how about some questions of usefulness and effectiveness? i know that these are not totally un uh uh removable, but i find that any actual tactical questions get turned into moral questions almost immediately, and then it is insisted, no, no, we have to solve this moral question and decide who's right between these two. sides on this moral issue before we can progress, because then we're going to be using the master's tools or some bullshit and my answer to that is just these differences you think you have are unresolvable and besides the point because the rightness of the of the morality honestly a lot of it will be revealed in in in the course of who is arguing in good faith uh and uh and with an eye towards like reality those are the kind of things that suggest to you who is uh more more connected to reality and more likely to be able to uh conceive of and pursue effective action. uh, is it that is it that easy to remove your choice from provoting ironically from the effect that not having Trump and office has on many Americans? well, for one thing, I don't what that effect is going to be, people say that, but what does it really mean? do you what do you really mean by that is my question, I guess, what, and I would like people to list this, what realistically do they think, what pain, what persistent pain are we going to see removed from America by Biden being president instead of Trump? I'm not talking about anything in terms of uh you know norms or or even even things of normalizing and all that stuff because yes that's that might be true but it's a little high in the sky. I'm talking about actual conditions. I mean do you think that they're just going to open up all those uh cages for the kids and and just let them out and and do you think that's going to happen? I don't think that's going to happen. Now yes, uh, I would say one group, visa holders or people seeking visas, absolutely 100%. I agree that that will, that there will be a immediate uh boot off of your neck, for sure. I'm not like saying there is none, I'm trying to run through what they actually are, so that's one for sure, visa holders in general, but other than that, like people who are here illegally, there might be fewer ice raids and stuff, but like deportation still going to happen. Ice is still going to be there, environment, I mean, what does by, what does Biden want to really do, what does Biden really want to do that's that different from what's Trump's doing, maybe he might close off a few public lands to drilling, which is good, but once again, like in a broader sense, have we decelerated any trends significantly, and like the big one, people want to talk about authoritarianism, but I'm sorry, with this fucking witmer kidnapping plot and her response to it, I mean, I don't really, I don't see some sort of ratcheting down of authoritarian uh, like excess in the biden term, if anything, what you might see is sort of like a war on terror, war on domestic terror, like where the Whit plot becomes a model for like a newly anti-fascist uh uh federal law enforcement mechanism, like a antifat DHS and FBI that's going to uh, maintain popular support. by reminding people of how many, how many nazis are under the bed, and even if they don't do that, there's going to be plenty, there's going to be uh, plenty of uh blame to go around enough to allow sort of the the current uh authoritarian moment to continue essentially unchallenged, like these democratic mayors who send in squads of psycho cops to gass everybody. They're not going to act any differently with Biden's in charge and Biden's not going to what put any real pressure on them, but again these questions are secondary because none of you are going to determine the outcome of this, you pressing a button doesn't make it happen, you going in and voting for Biden doesn't mean that when in, you're responsible that he's in there, and therefore responsible for all the lives that were saved. or if you don't phone for biden, you're responsible for all the extra deaths. misery, that's not true, why is voting for Berney a collective political act or voting for Biden can't be? because Bernie represented a coherent challenge to the Democratic Party as such from within, and you had to accept certain premises that differed from fundamental democratic policy uh agendas and and tactical uh understandings and doctrine in order to vote for Berney, and that wouldn't mean that you're going to now become a diehard, you're not going to, but it's going to mean that your voting is, it's not just for one candidate, it is for a coherent political project, the democratic candidate who emerged from that fucking primary after defeating Bernie, uh, has no such, there's no coherence behind the vote against it, it's everyone from embarrassed suburban republicans to uh to... f and who the hell you think is going to get the actual influence in that campaign or i mean in that presidency? that's another way you can tell the really dumb the dumb the dumb conservatives are the ones who actually believe that biden is like inthrall to antif or whatever the fuck like there was some dumb thing from that nitwitsteen brother and fucking conceptual james today about involuntary conservatives about people who will accept all the horrible ideas that yes we understand 100% how terrible Trump is, we are reality based, we understand that Trump is awful and that he lies and that he is a fraud and a criminal and all this stuff, because to not underst, honestly like educated people understand that to not at least recognize Trump's manifest and manifold failures as a human and as a fucking president and is everything requires a certain uh glassy eyed mania to you, it requires you to be in the thraw of maga to some degree uh to to a degree that is reality warping outside of the... level of warp you're allowed in polite company, so you got to think of some other reason, and the one these guys have cooked up is that i can't vote for biden cuz look at these guys saying abolish the constitution and and court pack and and uh and enforce uh anti-racism at the barrel of a gun and that is a result of someone being a moroon and also just looking at twitter all day and thinking it's real life because if you can't look at the actual dynamic. of the party and what has happened in the last year and see that there is no actual influence from that part of whoever ends up voting for the democrats on Biden, on the DNC, on the party in general, you are, you are as you are as self-hypnotized as a queue person, I'm sorry, I don't care if you want to think you're smarter than them, but you're basically not, if you could look at the world and look at the democratic party and say, yeah, you know, Biden, he's a he's a puppet for uh, for the fucking um, for what the new black panther party or whatever the fuck? i mean, now when you want to talk at the level of like language, yeah, i would be, i can't wait to see how hilariously woke Biden tries to be, like obviously they're going to use kamala for most of it, but there's going to all the language, all the academic anti-racism language is going to come out, it's going to be horrifying, and i welcome it, because you know, i think it'll be an alienating moment for a lot of people to just see the wildly uh uh uh cynical use of their language and they're going to be left with a choice like do i do i accept the the reality that this stuff really at this point is just just a cudle for the establishment uh or do I realize that it has to be transcendent and I mean I'm not saying everybody is going to choose the right choice there but I think some people will and I welcome that as a possible good outcome of Biden being in there uh but anyway there will be no practical changes. is no policies are going to be enforced to make your life, they're not going to fucking brow up the constitution or the Supreme Court, it's just talking about how they need to reinforce the the the uh public uh, they need to super what they're going to be doing in there is taking every institution that Trump undermined by treating it like it was, because Trump went in there like a child and he didn't understand that he's supposed to be upholding the Kfabe that no, these institutions are not independent, these institutions are not political, he just went in there and is like yeah no, this these guys all work for me, right? FBI director works for me, Supreme Court worked for me, these guys are all, I'm all, I'm on the apprentice and these are my employees. In reality, yeah, like at this point, you know, the constitution plus uh, you know, 250 years of uh, of governmental uh, expansion and complication, all of it being concentrated in one executive office that is the combination of head of state and government for some stupid fucking reason. In reality, all these things that were supposed to be checks on presidency are not just extensions of presidential power, especially, and then if the party that the president in in a new par in a partisan political environment where there's two. two co- coherent parties with like different agendas that superseed any kind of uh uh invest in an institution that they might be a part of, that means that if you control the legislative, they essentially work for you too, and he treated everybody that way, and democrats have spent four years freaking out because we're not supposed to realize that, we're not supposed to know that, we're supposed to think that no, these things are independent, these things are checks on both sides. so that they can be used when they need to be used, and when you get a 6-3 majority in the Supreme Court, you're the democrats, my god, that is a gift, now we did, now we have a a guaranteed uh excuse for why we could never follow through on anything that our base wants and has a delusion in their mind that we actually want have any interest in pursuing, and so when he gets in there, Biden is going to just be like fucking uh uh fixed Felix from Recket Ralf just going around and uh putting back all of these institutions building up the their independence from from the executive, and that means they're not going to fucking monkey with the constitution, they're not going to add any seats to the Supreme Court, and if you think they are, you're a fucking moron, and you and you just stared into the abiss of of the online for so long that you've turned the fucking random hooding of a bunch of just coopedicted uh pseudo radicals who spend their days online uh cause playing a political revolution that they know in their heart. happen and then say, yeah, these guys actually control the Democratic party. Wait a minute, all right, this is interesting, your argument is forget about the visa holders, forget about the COVID victims, forget about women in minorities, I need to wax ambilent about voters to self sooit about the Verney loss. Once again, I don't get what that has to do with my vote. I am not determining any of that. My vote and even what I say on the stream will not determine that outcome and I keep banging that drum because like losing these things lose these ritualized pseudo performances of political power have to be broken down and that means voting as like the locus of political meaning and moral expression and also posting because they're just different manifestations of the... the same uh the same phenomenon of of just this shadow politics. now voting for no, that's different. if you don't get why it's different, it's not for you, and nothing in this world. is, remember that one? all right, what is it? it's almost time, maybe one question before i go. voting, less than posting, less than podcasting. i would say, i would say, i would say voting is will be one step closer than either podcasting or voting to real politics. because it does contribute to an event that has an actual impact on something, i will say that, but it's just one level more advanced, it's just one level removed. uh, and the thing is, there's an accelerationist case for biden too. like there's all these guys out there who've decided that they're going to that their their form of cope is, i'm actually voting for Trump, because uh, you know, he's the real challenge to the status quo or over, it's like that, you're just trying to uh ring some some meeting out of this, some sense that you're not owned, sorry, everyone's fucking owned in this, we've all been owned, there's no way out of, there's no vote you can do, there's nothing you can have in your head while you're pressing the button that's going to unown you in this election, we are full to the way that people talk about it, to the amount of psychic resources that it kicks up, the amount of people's political identity it composes, and i'd say running for office would be one more step closer to real action than voting, but once again at that point come the questions of like tactics and feasibility, if you're going to run for something, why? is it to get out of the house? do you have an act? thing to contribute beyond I've read the posts and I have the good politics from the good posts, do is there something about you specifically that positions you well to present a socialist alternative in a plausible like uh electoral context? like it's a it's a stack like political identity is the stack of actions that go from thinking some having certain things that you think. his ideas to expressing those ideas to the people around you, expressing them online in different formats, then expressing them through actions like you know organizing uh, you know, organizing a union where you work if that's viable, or running for office or whatever, or voting, whatever, those are actions, and it's it's a our understanding of ourselves is like pursuing political goals, embodying political ideas is some percentage of those things and all I am saying is that voting is this gigantic thing in people's self-conceptions around it, and as long as it is, it's just going to rob you of the fuel to really pursue anything that might be more close to the ground and more consistent, like a daily use of power that goes beyond just thinking things and expressing them online, a daily pressing against the the the uh accumulated horrors around. living a political life, living political ideas, and voting, not saying that wouldn't be part of that, this isn't all, this isn't either or, it's yes and it's adding things to your understanding of what it takes to be, what it really means to be a political subject, and the only way you can do that is if you have to make room for other things and and i'd say the thing to to kick out first of all, thing that dump off the fucking uh the hot air balloon to lighten the load is your understanding of the of the moral uh weight around the issue of voting beyond that like when people say when you okay well log off what do you do that's up to you you have to make that decision based on your own world and your own life and your own understanding of your world and your life. i can say vote as part of a political expression then though who to vote for. Same thing, you got to make that choice. All right guys, I'm going to log off here, it's a I'm I'm going to likely the fake news media is going to smear me again. after this about what he said about voting, but it really does seem like there's like a conscious decision to not hear what i'm fucking saying, maybe i'm not expressing myself clearly and that's very possible, i am just going off the fucking top of my head, but i really do feel like the responses i get from people to when i try to explain this stuff, it does seem like they're trying not to get what i'm saying. all right, i'm logging off, bye-bye.
