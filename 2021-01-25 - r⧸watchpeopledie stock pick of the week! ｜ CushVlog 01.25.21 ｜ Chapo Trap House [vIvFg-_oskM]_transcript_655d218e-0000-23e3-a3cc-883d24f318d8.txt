 Roland was a warrior from the land of the midnight sun, with the Thompson gone for her fighting to be done, the deal was made in Denmark on a dark and stormy day, so he set out for bia to join the bloody frey. from 66 and seven, they fought the congo wars with the fingers on the trigger, knee deep and gor, for days and nights they battled the band to to their knees, they killed to one they're living and they help out the congolales, rollling the Thompson gunner. howdy folks, this is a muncher only stream, if you're not a munch head, if you have not accepted muncherism as the only meaningful ideology of the 21st century, then you need to log off this chat, these is for munch heads only, muncher number one, munch, munch house, the munch is loose, uh, people don't know what i'm talking about, uh, it was revealed that the new slimer for the sequel/reboot of Ghostbusters, just have to stop my... from doing some miming something that might get me taken off of the stream uh is been is out and his name is muncher uh and he is if someone wants to put a picture of him in the uh in the chat here it'd be helpful uh or you can google him yourself he is uh i don't have a way to show it i'm sorry i guess i should draw a picture of him or something he is green he is blue instead of green he has six. instead of the two uh, and then he has a face of pure misery, he looks just an embodyment of agony, he looks like one of the damn souls in a Bosch painting, he is pure uh anguished existence, he is begging for a death that has already come uh, as opposed to slimer who's like just a big fat party animal who enjoys putting a lot of hot dogs in his mouth and what's interesting about this to me and the reason that i i muncher speaks to me uh is something that uh friend of the show uh Josh Andrewski said he said that muncher is gritty for people who know that it's over uh muncher is a mascot of of true hopelessness because think about the trajectory that you have to do to go from slimer to muncher, what is the distinction here, how how are we to, how are we to place the monster in context? so first we have in the original ghostbusters we have the ghost himself the slime, and what is the slime? the slimeer is a being appya, the the slimer he seeks to consume, he cannot not for digested. not not for nutrients but purely for the pleasure of consumption and he is presented as such as as as a being of of a pure expression and desire at last the the the lakanian subject, what is muncher? muncher seeks the same outcome, the muncher seeks to consume, the monster the are quick to point out he wants to eat the corn, there is corn behind the monster and the monster he wants to eat the corn, this is key that the monster also much like the slimer, he wants to eat the corn, but but this is the crucial distinction, the monster does not enjoy the consumption of the corn, the monster is at no point in finding his pleasure even momentarily satisfied because he is the simulacra, he is the the copy of the copy of the original slimer, his 'his consumption has consumed him, his failure to rec realize his desires has consumed him and left him unable to enjoy anything, much as we, the consumer of the programs of the films are left to watch the ghostbusters film, but have to have none of the pleasure of first watching the ghostbuster, the original busting of the ghost.' buse the munch, muncher is slimer emptied of any reason for being, buse muncher's there because the ghostbust slimer was... because he was part of the concept of ghostbusters that genuinely insane man dan acroid thought of, and he was a part of that, muncher only exists because a certain segment of the population has heard of ghostbusters, and therefore an investment of money into the ghostbusters franchise has some degree of probability of being recooped at some degree of level that can be put on a piece of paper to mark to market accountant to keep the flow of uh of... circulating through your your corporate energy, that's it, that's why muncher exists, and so even though he's doing the same thing that slimer was doing consumption from beyond the grave, this literal hungry ghost, a literal hungry ghost, his pleasure has been robbed of him, and also the other reason that he is divorced is of of pleasure of... of any satisfaction is because he truly is slimer after 40 years of being slimer, much as we collectively are slimer after 40 years of being slimer, like America in its post 70s form is a place where all questions of democracy, of autonomy, control over one's life and circumstances of life have been seated in exchange for. credit basically, and and with that credit, the ability to consume cheaply. so what has that left us? it started the gogo Regan 80s, we were the bright green goblin, stuffing hot dogs in our mouth, exultat in the pleasures that come with unlimited access to cheap goods, anything we can imagine, it doesn't matter that industrial, industrial policy and employment policy and wages are no longer democrat. questions that our control over the the pace of and conditions of and substance of work is been lost unless you can make it through the gauntlet of post graduate education and get a uh get some job that gives you some illusion of meeting even though even there you are fully at the whim of your employer what we've given that up that section of of human self um self-realization, self-actualization has been seated in exchange for consumption, and what have we done? we have consumed, and where has it left us? it has left us at muncher, it has left us, sickly blue, blue, the color of depression, covered in arms to grab, to grab desperately, and a face racked in to quote myself referring to... the baseball crank, another signal of the time, an anguished rictus, and that is why I believe that Muncharism is 21st century marxism and must be supported against all critics. We love Munchher, don't we folks? We love him, we love the munch, look at this guy, look at him, he's blue, he's got the arms, man, he's gone, can you guys, have you guys? has been able to get your head around how fast Trump disappeared after being the only person in America in some significant ways for four years he is now an unperson we just like Kaiser fucking sose I got to say I did not see that one coming and I think more than anything it boils down to them getting taking away his twitter account uh and I think something about getting the Twitter account taken away and honestly Deutsche Bank. pulling the plug uh disciplined him like deeply, as much as he wishes he was still out there screaming into the void so that he could fill the void with himself, he is he's finally for the first time maybe in his life feared a consequence and as a result he is allowing himself to be forgotten because remember he has the choice, he could be out there, he could be continuing himself, like twitter. account or no twitter account, he could just say, hey, i'm going to a a a rally, you want to come? problem is he would have to do that stuff himself now, the machinery that existed before to allow him to say, i want to go to the alamo, and then they go to alimo texas, because even the people he surrounds himself, even the professionals are more ons, he can't just press a button and have that happen anymore, and so he can't do anything, it really does tell you, and it really should tell more than anyone the lives. that he was never in charge of this thing, whatever you want to call it, he was never a puppet master, he was never a string paller, he was always being allowed to do what he could, what the what? wanted, because it served the interest of other people, and that's the thing the people who like to point out, like when you're trying to argue about fascism, oh god, they'll say it doesn't, you can't point out that Trump is incompetent, the real fascists, the original fascists were incompetent, yeah, Hitler and Mussolini were a couple of complete fail son dip shit fuckups, they were guys who were in politics first and foremost because they couldn't get any other fucking work and they were too lazy or uh lacking in in actual skill to support themselves any other way than getting on a stump and bullshitting to people. I should talk, I'm in the same filum of human, I mean I hope I'm not as evil and I'm honestly not as charismatic, but they were fuckups and when they took power they didn't become any less fuckups, they were essentially gamers, I mean diday succeeded in part because they were the German high command was too afraid to wake up Hitler because he slept till noon every day during World War II. and Mussolini was like banging 15 of his mistresses a day in his stupid palace while looking at a giant globe, like they were they were just they were lazy dipshits, the reason that they were able to take power is because they were given power by powers that saw use in them, and Trump was useful, and he no longer is, and we are seeing that absent those supporting institutions, he has no independent uh ability to operate. which is why uh it would be hilarious if they oh god no I'm saying if they're doing to do it this stupid fucking impeachment oh my god the dumbest shit on earth absolute I mean honestly you can't get mad at it or demand they stop doing it they're democrats that's what they do but this is bullshit about holding him accountable I'm sorry he left he lost the election he's out of office. what you're going to double kick him out of office and this idea that oh you're going to banish him from future office we've already seen how much he is dependent on all these exterior things to keep him in power and secondly hey if you don't want to fucking face him in 2024 how about you do anything to deserve another fucking term how about that and that goes for the republican party too how about you like become coherent in some way to oppose just being pushed over by this guy. and I honestly think the reason they're doing this impeachment trial is because they know in their hearts he's not going to get a criminal trial because we cannot hold anyone who's ever held real power in this country criminally liable for anything. Nobody can even imagine that anything they do, either in or out of office, either in or having to do with their being president or not, seeing the inside of a jail cell. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, because... as soon as that taboo breaks then the politicized prosecution of political enemies and losers is on the table and these guys are all criminals so they don't want to have that happen and so instead we're going to get a big stupid trial in the senate that will waste everyone's time and do nothing and will just further emphasize to anybody casually paying attention to to. that these the biden administration, these fucking democrats don't give a shit about anyone and they will be correct. do i go for it on fourth down? of course i do, that was one of the most absolutely, i mean i can't get too mad, i haven't really been watching this year, i haven't really cared about football. for a while, i really more at this point just want my boy Aaron Rogers to get another ring because I think he's such a such a pretty quarterback, but I did watch that game and that last, that was a ba one of the most baffling, just I felt the spirit of Mike Mccarthy cackling with the light, and now he's gone, he's definitely gone, but bye, apparently he took a flight to DC to talk to Dan Schneider, which hilarious if it happens and what i it would be fun if he if he did like a a Tom Brady and went to another team and immediately won a super bowl but we'll see bye-bye yeah no that was baffling that was that was really not great i did not buy any game stock stock game stop stock game stop stock no i didn't buy any of that cuz at this point it feels like it's too late right i mean obviously they can keep going for a while. but I don't want to be the last money in there, I'm never, I'm not on reddit, and this truth, maybe I should be on reddit more, get on the ground floor for some public criminal behavior, this has to be intervened with right, like... there's a there's a fucking hedge fund that had to get a private bailout to the tune of two and a half billion dollars because these fucking tokito eating motherfuckers on reddit decided to buy a bunch of game stock stop to game stop stock with their stimulus checks wall street cannot allow that to continue there will have to be prosecutions or some sort of regulatory crackdown just because not because it's get wrong or even illegal, but because it is too disruptive to the flow, it's too, it's adding too much unpredictability to a system that is already clearly teetering. of course, one thing they could do is uh crack down on short selling, which is what this whole thing was premised on, but can't do that, because that's that's how the real people make money. Yeah, we're certainly definitely not in in a in a bubble, people asking about Glen Greenwalld or uh, fucking Jimmy Dore, bad faith, force the vote, people are very frustrated by all these arguments one way or another or having or their frustrated that they're being had, this is the outcome of losing. and having Trump gone, like if you have invested in you, politics to this point, if your politics have been shaped by this online discourse, and by the underlying assumption that online discourse can provide meaningful guides to action or meaningful coordinations of behavior that can affect politics, then this moment where the democrats are in power, there's no real plausible way to them now and because the republicans are right there, that 50/50 senate, oh god, perfect for them, to get to push off, for each for each base to be placated with accusations against the other for not being unifying enough, we get back to the obama years in every sense, but now with a fully developed political, social media culture, which didn't really exist under Obama, or it was like, it was, it still existed, but it was, it was in this weird transitionary period between the blog era and social media, like that whole Obama years, you didn't really get until the second, like the the last uh, the last two years of Obama's term before you get something really like the even early emergence of an a self-conscious online like left-wing uh movement to use the word incredibly loosely. and so now you're going to have a fully developed one with the same dynamic, the same dynamic of powerlessness at the bottom and a republican part a democratic and republican party dedicated to you, bipartisan austerity in the face of misery uh at the top, and that means that you, uh, there's going to be a lot of h to be made and a lot of incentive for people to create big. sparky fights with each other to simulate forward movement, to simulate power and authority more than anything, that's the really important part is that this stuff is about creating the illusion of momentum forward, because if you're fighting with somebody who is on another show, on another uh has their own you know uh click and you can uh criticize them. have them criticize you, that dynamic, that conflict can simulate a like the a a movement finding a direction, like it becomes our a virtual reality version of you know like a floor fight at a convention, only there is no convention and there's no party and there is no um power, and then no one, more importantly none of the people represent anyone, they don't... represent anyone in the sense that there is a coordinated group of people who have like certain demands, have certain um, they don't have a block, all they have is uh viewers, and the thing about viewers is that there's a lot of reasons that you watch something or listen to something, they don't always, they don't correspond politically. because it's not really politics, it is entertainment, and I'm not really condemming this, I'm not saying it's bad, I think the argument that bad is premised on another misconception, which is if people weren't doing this, they would be doing something more productive, and maybe if they were online less they would find something more productive in their lives, but as long as they're going to be on here, anything they do is going to be non-productive, uh, the I guess I just, I just... personally cannot invest the energy in it, but it's because people feel frustrated, i mean my god, we're we're in the middle of a fucking pandemic, the fucking economy is teetering on collapse, they're uh, they're got their thumbs up their ass about everything, uh, there is there is essentially an admission by the... power, the party that just took power in a huge buukaki of self-importance, this absurd spectacle of inaugural, the return of sanity and unity and decency, and then immediately said, yeah, there's really nothing we can do about any of this stuff, the fucked up vaccine rollout, the massive increase, the the the massive the numbers of deaths, oh more strains coming, uh, we're going to see about, we're going to listen to the science, but that still means reopening stuff, because there's no alternative to keeping the... goddamn economy moving, keep the money circulating, because we have no large scale uh capacity or interest in doing anything else, anything that could actually be a meaningful check on uh spread, instead faouch's out there today saying, you know what, maybe wear two masks, so that now when you're out, you can feel better about yourself for having two masks and you can judge all those other people who only have one mask. and then the people with one mask now have like a nice precariity where they can feel superior to the people who don't wear any masks and then feel like a weird hostility and uh resentment of people who show off by wearing two and so you get another layer of resentment field uh uh self-expressive politics to make up for the complete lack of any coordinated fucking uh ameliorative project here. and in such a context why wouldn't you be pissed, why wouldn't you want to see someone to blame? and if you really have spent the last four years convincing yourself that these debates push the wheel forward in some way, then there's a lot of emotional investment in picking the right leaders and holding the wrong ones to account for their bad faith and their bad views. I mean the people a good example of this is the boogalu boy thing with Jimmy Door, how many boogalou boys are there in this country? realistically, how many of these guys exist? what difference does it make? and either way, and I'm sorry, people say this is like monstrously dangerous because oh people are gonna flood into their movement, no, no, it's all bullshit. It is, it is, you are, you are, you're talking to this in, you're talking to and about a incredibly self-selected group of political maniacs, people who have driven themselves mad by politics one way or another, and are invested in like public performance of politics, that is a thin slice of the population that cannot and will not like uh, spontaneously regene like... expand its size and the idea that well these people are being funneld into it, who is being funneled where everyone is just online, and you have to be a certain type of mindset to see this whole fucking thing playing out and go, yes, I'm going to wear a Hawaiian shirt and carry a gun around at a protest, and that that combination of stuff, the very last step of that is whatever they see on the internet, that's the last thing that gets someone there, it's and honestly the least... consequential step of all of them, it's almost arbitrary, i am not the most soy person ever, thank you very much, at least uh, at least i have an actual beard, i did used to have a neck beard, i will admit, but i do have an actual beard, i was annoyed me when people would say, call me a neckbeard after i got a real one, i'm like, i'm sorry sir, this is not a neckbeard. oh, good, thank you, someone asked about that hilarious uh, american uh, conservative piece saying that we need a salazar. I love that because it really does show a lot of uh the very the pathologies we're talking about here um if people don't know salazar uh is like the he should really be more loved amongst like the the dork right you know like the the book nerds like the guys who uh uh the incel types because he is of the 20. century European dictators, he didn't come out of like the military or anything or even politics, he was a professor, he was an economics professor, and when the military overthrew the uh government in Portugal, uh, they no one really knew what to do, and the only competent person in in who got a portfolio was salazar, because of his technocratic uh, uh, economics economic, um skills was made finance minister and he did such a dang good job that they made him prime minister and eventually he was able to consolidate power around himself and away from the military uh and then he'd had like a franco esc run as a super as the guys as prime minister of the estado novo the new state which is like the syncretic thing that he created there uh and there's a and him and uh franco also shared the fact that their deaths were very prolonged and in salazar's case kind of comical because Salazar had a stroke uh and everyone thought he was going to die and an opponent and a a successor was appointed and was already ruling when he came out of the coma uh and they didn't want to I mean they'd already done the transition it was going and nobody knew how many marbles he still had so instead of putting him back in charge they just told him he was back in charge and gave him like a little desk and a little phone that didn't connect anything until and then waited for him to die. and then after that the uh his successor was overthrown by a communist led military coup, well a very rare thing indeed, the carnation revolution, which as i've said is the closest thing we really have to anything we can hope for, so this is sort of like the right-wing flip side of that, like i'm i'm pinining for a uh a a American cornatian revolution and the American conservative is pining for an American astado novo, but One thing that it really exemplifies is hot what I'm saying and refers to that I was talking about the total boutique uh irrelevance of all of this online argumentation like I would say one in a thousand Americans knows who fucking uh Salazar is at most this is just a thing for nerds to talk about and then even in the but even on its own terms, it's a failure, because I read that piece, and obviously it's garbage and he softcells salazar's brutality because they were brutal, it was a brutal police state, they tortured and murdered communists, they had concentration camps and also they carried out horrifyingly brutal uh colonial wars, long past the point when it was pretty clear to every other colonial power in Europe that it was no longer viable to have these things uh he was one of the last supporters in Europe that uh the illegal white minority government in Roedisia had, which he didn't talk about, but what he did say in the article is he created this beautiful syncretic thing, this paternalistic traditionalism that gave everybody like security where they were and prevented the market from like totally destabilizing everything and prevented most importantly politics from poisoning every relationship and and since we're all too politicized now to really... deal with one another, and that is true, and this thing that we have to deal with, the fact that like the the basic premise of of um, like political collaboration that has to undergird even partisan conflict has dissolved, like that's a real crisis that we need to deal with, but his, but the idea that the way to solve that is some uh integralist uh state shows you how just how much people don't understand what America is, because even if you accept his description of the salazar regime, of the estado novo on face value, the thing that allowed it to work is that it was, it truly was like a barely post feudal hegemonically catholic country that actually did have like social traditions that could undergird a political order, the idea that America could ever duplicate that is insane because the... there is no social betting, social um restraint to individual desire, everybody in America, like the American traditional ideal. that the that that would have to undergird whatever he's talking about our version of that like catholic integralist which certainly couldn't be catholic because there aren't that many catholics in america and most of the ones who are and most of the catholics we do have are protestant, what we have, what we have as like an embedded social tradition is i get to do whatever i want, and that's true of conservatives as true as it is of the most licentious liberal, and i think the last four years have shown that pretty clearly. any argument that that that there's that the patriarchal uh capitalist protestant order that like woke capitalism is overthrowing is in any way more like uh that is is anyway more socially restrained any anyway less maniically committed to self-satisfaction at the expense of everyone else like i get to do what i want when i want and and limitations on me are in fact limit on freedom, conservatives believe that just as much as you know the decadent bushwick uh witches that they hate to. there is no social framework that involves uh a idea of social expression and liberty that is not maximal like it is not maximally committed to personal for personal satisfaction and for Americans, that means uh, more than anything, resource consumption, and if that's what it is, you cannot have any stable uh, non-political order overrule that, and and and and coordinate that, because figuring out who gets what is politics, and if there's nothing in your social framework that even suggests that anybody else. but you get everything then you need you need either a strong like uh alienated technocratic uh you need a strong if you have a government that's going to work at all it's going to be it's going to necessitate as much access to resources as possible and our crisis is a crisis of resource access and the reduction of it. the reduction of the expectation of it more than anything, and salazar could tell to the the hungry masses of the 30s, go to mass, stop, stop wanting, stop wanting a car, go go to mass, or they won't even consider that, the most part you're talking about incredibly poor people in Portugal, they just wanted to fucking eat, but you could say, hey, the fucking the bishop doesn't want you to do that, think, think of everybody else, there's nothing doing that, there's nothing to to ground us, there's nothing to work from, even if the uh the the uh normal Americans, even if our like white middle class, the white middle class base of conservative reaction in this country took power, there'd be nothing there to ground them because everything i want, when i want it is the sum total of American culture and America's expectation of um life and the only way that maintains itself is uh domination and extraction at home and abroad in some combination, but yeah it reminds you that the right is just as out to like the the online intellectual right is as out to lunch as the left is, is as committed to building their little ships in a bottle, and fantasizing about autonomy and ability to to influence the market and politics as the left is, people want me to talk about Australia day, I have no idea why you would, what, what, what about Australia? is that like the 4th of July for Australia basically? I'm assuming that every year it's a big culture war thing because of the whole settler colonial genocide deal. I don't know why they fucking are so w rapped up about Australia. Don't get too attached to it, it will be uninhabitable in 20 years. I would not get too uh like fixated on on that. Hey, thanks, somebody. asking about Kurt Schlichter, I i was, I dm some friends of mine the other day and I said what the fuck happened to him, he this is his moment, he wrote two books about an America that's like broken up by... civil war between woke people and and real Americans, why was he not at the capital? why was, what is he been doing? i mean i don't know what he's been tweeting cuz he blocked me a long time ago, but i i would assume that i would have seen his takes like come through the tra transum, because even though he had had me blocked, he was always good, i would always find out when he said something insane because somebody else would say check out this, and somebody like whoa, i haven't. anything from him since before the election, he's still around, right? it's kind of blowing my mind, like did he just lose his nerve because this shit you would have thought when the election was contested and people were going to courthouses and demanding they stopped the count and people started saying we're going to go to Washington or second American revolution, you would have thought he would have been at the precipice of it, you would have thought that he would have been like on point rallying the troops. I'm going to see if he, I'm going to see what he's last, if he's been tweeting, buse, this is honestly baffling to me how quiet he went, oh did he get, well this might explain it, he's not, did he delete his account? Ah, there he is, ah, here he is, wait a minute, he has a town hall article about how Joe Biden is a draft dodger, are you fucking kidding me, that's his shit, where is the second civil war, he's... one gotcha shit oh my god he's calling biden president asterix what a pussy this motherfucker was talking about during uh the george not even george floyd during the fucking uh mike brown protest talking about loading watching tv while loading his mags what a fucking cuck he's wining about how they're not doing enough unity oh my god Oh these fucking halfway, I mean I guess you can't expect anything more from some guy who like sat behind a desk in Kosovo and basically acted like he went into Fallugia with the first uh first marines oh pathetic pathetic i mean if you see that if you see that moment pop off after all that running and and two books about it, and that and honestly, this should have told you all you needed to know about how serious this like insurgency was, anybody who has a mortgage, anybody who has a little bit to lose or uh, or is like well secure enough and like the media ecosystem that they don't need to uh like risk their life and safety for uh clicks and and engagements, they're not going to fucking risk anything. and that is still the the center of gravity of Trump supporters, what a fucking poser, oh he's just whining about celebrities being mean to Trump, oh my god. Man, I mean it's probably good that he didn't go to Washington, he's of the body shape to be one of the guys who killed over tasing his own balls. Yeah, Munchher sort of has filled the spot for Trump isn't it, like our collective expression, like he is a topa in the same way Trump was. I think I've talked enough about muncher for now, but I might come back to muncher, we'll see, yeah, so about the new book, I think I might do, I might do black reconstruction, but I'm I'm still deciding, I will uh, I will, I will let you know soon though. What's muncher? educate this fool, muncher is us, consuming, hands and mouth filled, but still miserable. people are mad yeah. Oh man, so there's a recall move for Gavin Newum, um, I'm actually kind of interested in how that would work because the way they recalled Grey Davis is that Daryl Isa, the uh Carl Arm Croook congressman, Carl Lum Kick Congressman from Orange County, paid millions of dollars to hire canvassers to go around and and get signatures and a lot of people signed him because uh he had botched the... the blackout situation and he had, i mean it was enron's fault if anyone seen smartest guys in the room they kind of make uh greay davis look like a sort of a marder because enron was the one who fucked him over by you know manipulating um the energy supply in order to boost their profits but he let them do it he fucking let them do it he had the ability to fucking act he could have seized that shit and he didn't do it cuuse he's a go along to get he's gray davis he's a democrat so i have no se for him like people were mad at him for a reason and but isa had the money and did it and of course in one of the greatest cuckings of all time he did that because he wanted to be governor he was going to be the guy who swooped in and replaced him and then Schwarznager just goes hey i want to be governor and then he had to endorse him and just an amazing bit of cuckery but for one how are you going to get are you going to get enough signatures now with every fewer people out and about uh and two. has the partisan dynamic changed so much that no matter how bad nusum is doing, any recall uh will be take will be assumed to be republican and therefore will be rejected by a California electorate that has turned pretty strongly against Republicans in general, but if he doesn't it'll be too bad because it would be a beautiful piece of history repeating itself if got recalled and then the rock became governor of California and of course people say, well the rock is a republican, he would obviously have to run as a democrat, that's a no-brainer, but I don't think that that would be too hard for him because he's already a uh you know on the on the um on the edge, he's already he's already condemned, device of talk and stuff, and that's all you really need to do for democrats to love you forever. Kluney would be good, because remember, California is nutty. If there's a recall, it's not like there's primaries or anything, there's one election where anybody who gets enough signatures or like files the paperwork can be on the ballot, and so you could get. like some celeb uh democrat to do it, that would be cool, but the rock makes the most sense as like a sequel to schwartseniger, somebody ask if poser and hustler is a better word to use in grifter grifter, i don't think that there's any reason to use those terms at all, because it is, it's all the whole question of grifting is the spider-man pointing at itself meme, because the grift, if there is one is the grift of the presentation of a fabricated reality whereby your participation in online political argument and online political opinion formation is organizing, that is: not true. now the people who operate from that assumption might not know that it's not true, they might be lying to themselves in order to keep themselves engaged because they have no other uh way of imagining themselves being uh and others might be aware of it but have justified things otherwise, but it's such a pervasive thing and it's so undergurts all of these things that like pointing out one person as a grifter over someone else. seems to be uh pretty small bore, I mean, it's dissecting the grape, like how do you determine, everyone is grifting, everyone is operating off of the same. shared delusion, yes, lizs and brace should run for governor and lieutenant governor of California. America. is a grift, someone says, 100%. That's one of the best things about Lodge 49 is that not only did it show what it's like to struggle in this country, the payday loan cycle and uh, people putting off purchases and put putting off healthcare, because they can't afford it, stuff like that, they get that part, but then what it also really gets is that the people who are making it, the people who are actually succeeded in this economy are not doing so by creating anything useful or by presiding over meaningful economic activity, they are sitting on a nesting in nesting pyramid schemes, they are there to be names on paper to move around money that is never that never has to be invested profitably in anything that just has to be moved around and just has to sit, like the whole the the background of the show. is that the the big defense contractor, which they call orbus in the show, which is modeled after boing, which is like, which has that role in as like a key industry in the real long beach, is closing, and they're in the process of shutting down all of its departments and and selling off all of its assets and creating these big and then dealing with the land that it had it had been on, and all and that so that was a real company you know that actually made shit in the in the forest you know - and what's replacing it, the the uh, the chain restaurant uh and the uh, the fake residential development are all just competing scams, and of course the tech sector, which is the only place where you know real money has been made in the US economy outside of extraction, in the past 20 years uh is the most exemplary, because that's entirely fictional. none of those companies make money. i don't know if anyone has seen the graph that was put that was put out recently of of uh the stock prices of non-profitable tech companies over the last few years. it is a shocking image. and of course we now have the richest man in the world being a man whose company. makes cars, a few of them that tend to blow up and kill people, like Tesla is a boutique car maker, it's like fucking uh, it's like Tuckers or Dusenberg or fucking uh, Mazarati, it is not like gm or or Ford or Chevy in terms of it's it's the cars it puts out, there's no reason for it's to be worth what it's worth other than the fact that Musk has as I said before been able to. monopolize the brand of a salvageable technological solution to our current crisis, and Uber has lost more money that could ever make back, even if it did become the monopoly uh transportation provider in the country, could never make back the money that's been spent on, but that's not the point, the point is not to ever uh make money, the point is to uh, is to move the money around, and as I've said, with the tech sector specifically, invest in technologies of surveillance and control, and now they're doing a thing with lift where like you have to bid. for a route and like you have to take, you have to take a lower rate to get more rides, this is uh the opposite, this is a this is a i believe Daniel uh pointed this out, this is like the old um, this is like the old hiring halls for unions only from the owners where and where they get to dictate your uh your terms because they control access to the to... to the opportunities to make the small amount of money. and the same way that the online political uh media ecosystem of grifting, whatever you want to call it, depends on people who want to be grifted, because they want their engagement with this to mean something, all of these stacked up criminalities they exist because we need them to be there. Yeah, the new social contract at at uh the world economic forum, it's neo feudalism, if you need a spoiler alert, it is you own nothing, you, you have access to things, you have access to streams of data to housing, to uh, to food sources that are conditional. on your relationship with the companies that provide them, that you want a good quick definition of techn feudalism at like a at the level of your economic relationships, that's it, and what that means is you have zero leverage over anything, not only have you lost the leverage as a uh, as a worker, as a producer that was lost with the end of organized labor, you have even lost your leverage as a consumer. which was what we were supposed to get instead, which was supposed to be the deal, yes, you no longer have control over your work, but you have control over what you buy, and that control exerts uh, allows you to exert leverage in the market, that's still too much, that's too much leverage when people are going to have to exist with less and less, so that has to go away too, and that's the new social contract. All right, I'm going to wrap up here in a minute, if anyone's got any more questions, well, yeah, somebody says they're not uh enjoying the surplus, it's really more about the distributing the surplus that other people and machines make elsewhere, because remember this is when we're talking about neofudalism. talking about it, the way that it's going to express itself in America, it's still going to depend on resource extraction and uh labor in other places of the world, part other parts of the supply chain, and then that sur plus comes here and then is distributed at the whim of no longer any kind of collaboration between you know people and capital that you saw in like the mixed economy of the 20th century. capital unbound, godzilla or kingkon, uh, i'll i'll watch that movie for one thing for sure, i mean i i see a movie if there's big things fighting in it, even if there's cji, i don't care, someone wants to say that they thought my diabetic joke was funny, i i'm sorry if people were offended by that, i it was really, i was not saying that like i was not making a fat choke or anything, i swear to god, i was just trying to make fun of... livs as always, but anyway, um, I will see a movie where two big things fight each other, I actually kind of did like uh, the first Godzilla, even though it was too self-serious, I enjoyed how much of a sense of proportion and size Godzilla had in that movie, and also the fact that he was in it so little, a lot of people complained about that, I liked it because you didn't burn out on him, I like kong skull island, did not like Godzella king of the monsters very much. but hey, it's Kong versus Godzilla and what are you going to do, what's wrong with that? although it is very funny how they had to make Kong way bigger than he is canonically because obviously the size differential is so so big that it's not really a contest uh which you know they did that already with the original uh king kong versus Godzilla but the one thing that always made it seem like a mismatch is the fire breath you know he has a tom fucking gods has atomic radiation, he can throw it at you from across the fucking town, from the another zip code, how are you as a giant ape supposed to defeat that? and there's a shot in the end of the trailer where he like has some sort of device that he uses to reflect the thing, i don't know, they have definitely um in these new godzilla movies they've made it a little better, a little easier for god king kong because um they've... sort of made it so that godzilla doesn't get to blow the fire very much, he has to like save up to do it, which hey, that could be the case, biologically, but of course the real thing is that obviously there's not actually going to be a winner or a loser, they're going to turn on a real enemy to fight together because they're both good guys, they're both now canonically good guys, uh they cannot, one of them can't lose, and that's fine, it's just who the bad guy is, like i'm sure it's going to be some other scarier monster, i would really like it though if it was the people, that would be the perfect kingzilla movie, if they were basically made to fight one another by these humans for their own amusement more than anything or for you know the the dark power designs of some of them and at some point in the fight Godzilla and king kong realize that and just start wiping out humanity, but I don't think we're going to get that sadly. Yeah, like deep ecology, and the thing is is that there they had a they've had a a weird through line of that in the movies, because the whole like godzilla is presented in these new Godzilla movies, these new legendary... godzilla movies as like this balancing force who restores the homeostasis within within the ecosystem once it's been thrown off and i don't understand how after now it's three movies godzilla has not realized that the thing destabilizing the goddamn ecosystem is not some giant uh fucking uh mots it is us. Man all right, I got to, I'm going to go off, but first, I want to say something about that wand division show, the amount, the degree to which the MCU people have gone up their own assholes, is breathtaking, the the degree to which they assume that everyone has not only watched all these movies, and the thing is, yeah, most people probably, most... movie goers probably have watched all of them, considering how much money they made, i'll admit I've seen them all, but not only that that they fucking care about all this bullshit, and i'm sorry those two things are not the same, and i will give Michael Bay credit for this above anything. Michael Bay does not give a shit, does not assume audience investment in the crap that he makes, there are five transformers movies, which I've seen all of, the lord in them like the internal cannon changes from movie to movie, there is no internal consistency, whatever they want to do they do, and they essentially forget what happened in the previous movies, because they know you're just here to see some stupid fucking robots fight each other, you're not here to do homework, like in the first the first words, the first fucking words in the first transformers movies are a voiceover by optimus prime saying in the beginning there was the cube and he says that this enerjon cube is what created life on uh cybertron and then they're fighting over it I think in the and then in the second movie they introduce the idea of like the other this this race of primes who all like kill themselves on earth millennia previously to hides the matrix of leadership and that there are and that um even though the first movie showed the cube like making machines come to life when it touched them, they had machines giving they had like baby robots being burst out of pods and robot heaven, the fourth movie had a robot goddess i believe voiced by kate Blanchet or somebody be the person who created uh life on earth. and also the transformers, and then of course the fifth one had king Arthur and Harriot Tubman as like secret autobot allies through history, none of it is connected to itself, none of it makes sense even internally, let alone from movie to movie, whereas the fucking smug assertion behind these motherfuckers make these marvel products. that everybody is hanging on every element of this shit and that you're going to sit through 30 minutes of a incredibly unfunny parody of a 50's sitcom because my god maybe there's something lurking beneath. this this placed suburban facade, when have i seen that before, so that you can get a few crumbs of reference to the fucking movies that came out years ago at this point, psychotic, and an imperial logic that is that is monstrous, and and uh, once again, give me, give me, give me bay, give me bay's um simple carnal desire to see things blow up, and to see women in wet shirts bend over motorcycles. all right folks, talk to you tomorrow, we will see how much gamestop stock is up in the next 24 hours, and then i'm if if it's still going up, i'm going to feel like a real idiot for not buying something. all right, bye-bye.
