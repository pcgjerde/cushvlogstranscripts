Okay, great, I'm a genius, guys, folks, I'm a genius, trouble has been shot by a super hacker, I'm practically Huw Jackman in the film, swordfish over here, very pleased with myself. uh, so we're going to finish up black Jacobs, I think maybe tomorrow or Wednesday, but today I wanted to talk a little bit about some stuff that's been in my head about uh, the good old cultural superstructure and and how it's generated, and I think you can really map out uh, a a historic trajectory that kind of shows that uh, we are living in a in a situation where culture is the thing that determines politics, like politics and our laws and the real to the extent that there's human agency in this system, it is being generated by that, it's it's it's that political structure that we all invest ourselves in, because it is the laws that keep us doing the things we do, and i mean obviously the law is not uh outside of our politics, it's carried out by politics, we make it a... un make it according to power's desire, but uh, it is what tells people what to do, like buse, you're not operating internally, you're being manipulated from outside by the system, and it has to tell you what to do, and laws and politics are how you do that, it is the deliberation that gives human agency to its decisions, to to this actions on the markets or on in the world. and the law is bending to the algorithm because there is no human resistance to it, because we're all pushing, no matter what we think we're doing, we're all pushing in its direction, because we have lost a the war over control of things like politics, we are no longer in control of politics, the 20th century, the violence of the... 20th century was essentially the human race in its final attempt to assert control of the machinery of capitalism and losing the war, humanity lost world war, humanity lost the 20th century war, the long 20th century is one big long war between humans in the machine and the humans lost, and what that means is that a lot of the assumptions that underlied politics in the 20th century are no longer operative and that and that means that our analysis has to be updated or else we're not accounting for changing conditions and the main condition is that the assumptions about politics that are around that that we're operating under, the ideas of elections, the ideas of cultural production, pushing public opinion, public opinion, forming into action, the things we can actually do to feel like we're affecting things in a market economy where we aren't for the most part operating from class consciousness or class cooperation. and the explosions of socialism and then the counter explosion of fascism and then the threlineine of sort of imperial domination that nitted them together is all the human race in revulsion to the depredations of capitalism, which on the one hand are creating this horrible. stabilization and uh undermining of understandings of the world and and human autonomy and uh uh like the soul you want you want to get goofy about it uh against this force that's pulling it away from them or pulling out your ability to be a person oh god damn it is it not working? and the reason technology won, the reason that the machine won is not because it was uh necessary for it to win, because it wasn't for human advancement it had to lose the final class war where humans come together to overthrow the algorithm uh. It won that war, not by annihilating us all, a lot of people died, but we also built structures of social order that allowed for a lot more people to live lives that were much more comfortable than had previously been possible, and that comfort made possible by their technological control of space and time in the form of laws, computers, everything. and we acceded to that because a lot of people got essentially bought off, the closer they were to the machinery center, the more they could be bought off when that technology is used to do direct exploitation away from power in through through the empire, and that solution to the contradictions of capitalism uh, was pursued as a way to ameliorate the anxieties of the of the lower and middle classes, which then formalized into socialism and then fascism as conditions deteriorated, even as the and that created a situation where first there was the uh the hobsian war over uh access to imperial markets that made world war one inevitable, and then once that happened, making world war 2 inevitable by allowing this uh defeated Germany the... capacity to create a social engine powered by middle class anxiety that could literally uh like sease control of capitalism and direct it to its own ends the same way that the bolcheviks were able to in Russia and they extended their power to the extent that they could until capitalism contained them and the way the capitalism contained the fascism was not by defeating it in world it was by absorbing it in World War II, it decapitated the nationalist sort of id of national socialism, but it incorporated the structures of power that had been developed within it, the actual people, the human capital with the institutional knowledge who had built it, were brought into the American imperium, to administer a global empire that would have at its base the job of... for the benefit of everyone broadly across class lines uh in the in the Europe first and then in the anglo-american sphere and that meant that as all of the the crisis is within national capitalism erupted uh like... up throughout the 19th and 20th centuries uh you see over and over again capitalism absorbing the energy of its opponents to further its goals of extending itself until you get a situation after world war 1 where you have finally a a a geopolitical conflict between capital and humanity in the form of the first the Russians and then and then the common turn and and then the third world movement after that, this coalition of forces resisting capitalism, and then coming together to put down this like cancerous eruption from. middle that is fascism, but then doing so by absorbing it. now the path not taken after world war 2, the one that maybe Henry Wallis or FDR would have pursued, could an actual cooperation with the Soviets after the Soviet fall of the after the fall of the Nazis might have theoretically created a new a world system that could solely drain the fascism, drain capitalism out it where there. out of it where a sufficient uh cooperation between the conscious working classes of these various nations like the the new the popular front basically persisting now that would have caused more war we still would have had huge conflict in the 20th century in fact we would have had an extension of conflict into a probably a third world war, but it would have been one that could have been winnable for the people, for humanity, and instead we lost, and I think the upshot of that. and and like I said, the reason they lost, they destroyed who they had to destroy with the technology that had been created, but those who could be bought off were incorporated into the structure, and then you have a superstructure created around then a cultural superstructure that incorporates these or these groups of people, including the self-conscious working class of these advanced nations that had formed along marxist developmental lines, exactly as he had predicted, these Europe had these constant of people thought of themselves as workers, and they were everywhere through the world, and the hope of after World War II is that they could all come together, but because Stalin pursued, cover my ass, save my ass strategy, where his well-being as ruler of Russia, and his regime's empowerment is more important than the his duty. to the the working classes of the world allows to create the conditions that make communism's defeat inevitable, because as soon as the brettonwood system of global trade is commissioned after world war ii, and the then the the under the the wildly underdeveloped and then recently war ravaged Soviet Union and then its allies in the under-developed third world, we're going to have to go it alone. and by going a alone they were going to have to try to compete within the global system within capitalism on the and that required the state capitalist uh alienation of the labor of workers for the state's benefit, which is why late the stalina estate did not create a worker state, it created a state where workers were in the same alienated position from their labor as they bed under capitalism, but there was a there was a socialized decision mechanism free of capitalism that apported the or alienated labor, which is of course superior in every way to capitalism, but still contains alienation that has to be socially selved. the only way to socially solve alienation, if you're not going to to to alienate further with repression is treats, is goodies, which is why's turn to a consumer economy. in the 50s was not some sort of betrayal, it was the only logical next step, it had to happen, in order to get people to work, you needed to give them incentives and those had to be market-based incentives and they were going to be less efficient than capitalism, and so capitalism beat them in the fight for resources in the third world, so that they could they beat him in creating the the global currency, and that means that in the late 80s when the final crisis came and there was more treats to give out and there was no more repression that could be exerted effectively, the whole thing shattered, because they had not built a new soviet person, because the people in the Soviet Union were still alienated the same way they'd been under capitalism, and that was that was made inevitable and stalin decided to fight it out in material to to fight it out on uh economic grounds after buse he had basically forsworn a real challenge for power on the field of battle, but also uh a a uh pressing forward of creating a coalition beyond Russia's uh borders, because they uh gave up on the the Greeks, they gave up on the Greek communists in order to solidify the warsaw pack line, the iron curtain line uh and then they uh they fucking... uh did not do any significant work to reach out to uh post colonial regimes or or colonial resistance movements that fight fighting to push off the last vestiges of formal colonialism. so as soon as the Soviets have to fight us on consumer happiness as an index for uh, for building and maintaining a a consensus reality, a consensual reality. capitalism has coersion in the form of its cybernetic network of technology hooked to the profit motive, but they also have social consent in a mass spectacle of of of mediated existence that is generated by all that fucking surplus that they get to play around with, they have a dream factory, we all get to live in the matrix, we all get to live in a funhouse version of reality, because we're living on the surplus extracted from others, we're living off of others paying. Now I'm not saying Stalim would have won that fight by the way, probably would have lost, I'm just saying that we know he didn't win by not doing it, we know he didn't win by by he the his position was not favorable to do what he did, because soon enough what do you have, the Chinese go communist, but they were they were more soci, they were just as much a feudal backwater if not more so than Russia. had been vastly more uh, they they had no developed capitalist mechanisms, no social relationships to created through the uh the the intensification of economic you know in uh action, they were absolute, it was it was a it was a fucking 200 year old empire for Christ's sake, and so there is this massive crisis, well how the hell do you get them to compete? what did they do? they had to kill like every system of of accumulation does, had to kill massive numbers of peasants, and then they had to exercise the guilt from that with their uh, with the cultural revolution, just like the bolchevics had to exercise uh the crime of uh the famins through the fucking uh red terror through, i'm sorry, not the red terror, through uh the um the purges. So one way or another, the system is uh, it has it has won the fight, it won in the 20th century the fight, and the final terms of of final surrender of the human race were laid uh there in in the neoliberal order, which is what the deal we got, which is all right, this is the final crisis moment to... set in conditions to move forward as we cybernetically uh our control to our ability to technologically control outstrips your ability to resist it, and so all we really have to do is provide as minimal basis as possible for you to keep fulfilling your necessary social role without us creating it making it too big of a headache to put you down and to use repression to prevent you from doing that, how much social coersion do we need to give you and uh and because the working classes of the world had been scattered to the winds by the 20th century, there was no coherent response, and so the institutions dominated by capital as they were, made a deal on capital's behalf, and that is the neoliberal deal, the Washington consensus, what you can grab in the market will allow you dignity, uh, humanity, it will be, it will be the final uh... hobsian descent, but it will be buffeted, it will, it will be buffeted and prevented from just being a freefrall collapse into chaos that doesn't serve capitalism's interests, uh, will give you enough treats, basically to make it go down smooth, but of course those treats are going to be dwindling over time, and so all of our post 89 politics has been this uh ritual exercising of all of our anxieties about the fact that we no longer control our destiny as a species, and so we're all freaking losing it, but and the reason we're losing it is because none of us can have identified where the enemy is because of the fact that we are all grasping for meaning through a miasma of post-class identity formations, like we are declassed in a way in a fundamental way and I mean by that is that when you talk about the Grahamshian model, when you talk about superstructure as the place where you build power through counter hegemoneny, you're talking about an assumption that was in the context of Gramshi in Italy and trying to answer the question, how do you take a country full of god fearing peasant hicks uh and make it uh an effective, and guide it towards socialism, and his and his answer is: you have to allow it to generate uh, it has to generate through the the lives of these people uh, in the form of their interaction with culture, because they do not and cannot experience the the other more clarifying conditions of working class existence, and so Gramshi spoke, was trying to speak to the question, how do you try to get to socialism from there, and it was: build these counter institutions that can give you the legitimacy that the experience that you're not getting uh because people not enough people are in labor relations, it's what do you do with the serfs? it's this questions always come down to what are we doing about the surfs? and i think we're in the situation now though where because the conditions, the terms of conditions of human surrender that happened in the late late 20th century were such that... human um control of institutions at all levels would be seed to the market, it meant that the culture that we're going to absorb will not contain actual working class perspectives, actual working class uh values, concerns, the kind of things that people would interact with in a culture and then use to clarify their actions in life, because we're even though we class people still make culture in their day-to-day lives, in their interactions with elite culture, and in their folk culture, their technologically aided folk culture, your tik toks and stuff, unlike in the 20th century, throughout the world, this culture is not, those working class people do not experience their lives as working class people, 20th century people across the world, when they thought of themselves, they thought of... themselves to some degree as a worker, it was a meaningful, coherent sliver of their identity, and it had a defined meaning and that was a a notions of solidarity, notions of uh democratic control of resources social ends. that was always there and that was always. that means the people in all of the highest levels of our uh structures, that the labor union heads, people who wrote for television, uh, people who ran for office, people who got stock jobs in the bureaucracy, uh, people who were living in the culture, were living so were with an understanding of what the working class was, who was in it and what its interests were, and that made their actions in the public stage like they voted for coherent and it also gave coherence to what they said when they were uh part of the superstructure like the working class people who made it through to hollywood to write to write and to direct and to produce work and to act working class people who who made up uh the the people who wrote on newspapers because that was a working class job at first that that was like people started on the street selling the paper and then they started writing for it um and then of course the politicians, like they were, they were people who uh, had in many cases come through labor unions, for example, so they had the understanding of who they were and what it meant to be that, and then they lived that way, but we've given over now to the Reagan Revolution, we gave over to that turn worldwide, we all came to some. we are giving up control of our lives in exchange for treats, and that was because that was the best deal anybody thought they could get at the time, and the ones who didn't think that were crushed, if you thought you could fight on, and you had integrity enough to do so, you did, and you lost, you were shelled out of the out of the Russian white house by Yelson, you were coed, you were sanctioned, you were embargoed, you were a... assassinated, you were fired, your movement was destroyed from within by uh, kintel pro, or if you... willing to take the deal, you got treats, if you were a post war American worker, you got and you were white for specifically, you got a house, you got a little quarter acre a lot that was yours, it was like your homestead, even though you couldn't grow crops on it and you couldn't live off of the land and so you still had to be a schmuck working every day, you have that, and things and that meant that over time you act there was less of a coherent uh working class element to this culture. because the working class were feeling themselves, their lives, their lives were defined not by the work they did, but their inter their interaction with the market as home owners, as members of the capitalist class and that affected the way that they interacted with culture, and it meant that by 1980 uh, the the American working class was sort of bought off and and repressed that way because remember there was a big strike wave that also happened and it was defeated and that was the stick and then the home-owner republic was the carrot and everybody was everyone made that decision on an individual basis, they were everyone, it was every man for themselves and that's why when Reagan said look, you can't ask anymore from the market, but we can got some others the state fat they were giving to these other people that aren't you, we're going to let you compete more. in the market and you have a head start, so let's go, and they took the deal, and why wouldn't they? it was the logical thing to do, everybody made the logical choice, which is why we're headed towards disaster, because the end result of everybody making the logical choice under capitalism is apocalypse, it's the end of the world, it's end of human civilization, it is, it is our illogical choices that bind us together, illogical choices that that define our relationship to the world and allow us to act not as individuals but as a part of a greater whole that can cooperate beyond compulsion and what we have to reckon with now and we're talking about what's the role of culture in politics and and what's the difference and that means where is the power? where can you assert influence? i would argue that there is no place that you can apply uh apply power to the culture now that can meaningfully interact, because everybody, including everyone who is trying all of their hardest to to effect change at that level can really act as a working class person, so that means this is not a situation where you're creating counter gr and because the center of gravity among everybody, if the the voting public who is going to vote the most is going to be the most comfortable, the people are going to go through with earnestness, the ritual of voting are going to be the people closest to power, hell, the ones that the... top don't just vote, they extra vote by putting money in, and that's because they feel like there's something that they're getting out of the transaction, they feel like this civic ritual can gives me results, my my contribution to this thing, and my the earnestness of my contribution for this thing, assumed in others is going to assure uh that we all move in the right direction. but our experience of class is only post-modern, we we experience our lives as consumers, we are we are consumer nation, and you - array your your politics around the symbols of these that we get from the culture, the mediated landscape that replaced the practical realm where we used to define our world, now everything is coming through. this this this veil of maya that were that were uh that were covered by and so when we interact with politics it means we are we will always be interacting with it on the conditions on the terms. along two widely understood groups, now in cap marxism, this polarization is supposed to go, workers and uh capitalists and uh in a in in the in the Bernsteen Koutsky revisionist model, that's how it's supposed to work, eventually you get a system where there's two big political groups within a democratic structure, one of them is a party of capital, the other is the party of workers, and then they go at it, and guess what, the workers win cuz there's more. that is the that's the uh SDP form formula for uh reform that be that uh becomes revolutionary and what we have seen is that the the the combined and uneven development has made it so that all of the alienations within some capitalisms that form up nationally can be bought off with the pain of others elsewhere because you are getting... "you're not getting class consciousness untainted from nationalism, they are stuck together at the same level because they are also experiencing their lives through meaningful uh structures around these nations that they live as realities, the same way they live their class as a reality." and so are we are getting to the point of like honestly we are getting to the point of critical class conflict in ever or i would say not class but sect conflict because what i'm saying is in all these societies where you have the the format of democracy with some sort of flexibility. within it to contain political uh uh alienation, shy of like revolution and and violence. you you're going to develop into an eventual situation where at the final moment of crisis there will be two groups, two broad groups and that they will then come to violence over their inability to use the system to resolve that the the at that point, one or the other win or take all, them or me, for survival, which is what everybody thinks they're in right now, they're not, but it feels that way, that's our, that's the frequency we're vibrating, vibrating at, because we all understand that that's where it has to end, when it ends that way we don't know, but it has to end at some point in the near future, and that's going to be true in every country, but what that alignment is depends on the country, and right now we have a situation where we have. two sides shaping up along universal suffrage where the most comfortable are going to vote and then that most comfortable is going to break along one line of recognition into two others, it's not like it's going to all go to one end, it's going to stay in the middle, because this is this is not a this is not the conflict, remember this is the conflict being resolved, this is humanity being bought off from its own youth, its own destruction, this it's the it's the fucking um It's the fent patch as we're being having our life force drained from us, and so that means even though we are all still have a relationship to a means of production, that means that we are that we are workers in some sense, we experience those concepts, class from a remove, from a from an emotional connection, from a... from a level of reality that puts them on par or or actually well far below other more visceral attachments around nation, around race, around gender, around all the other axes that make up everybody's personal sense of self that is not just defined by material interests, that's only one, that's only the basis for it, once you have a material interest once you have a general anterial interest, everything build on top of that is is all based on all the other things that you're experiencing in your life, and those things over time, as capitalist technology overs civilization humanity, our lives become less social and more mediated, and so our understanding of words like class and ideas like solidarity, and and what politics can and should do, like the entire note, the entire structure of our of our understanding of the world through like a political lens uh is shaped more and more by what we view, not what we experience, what we experience is class exploitation, that over time coales into class consciousness as we cooperate as workers. Now as we cooperate as workers we do things like create a newspaper or have a political party and those political parties do things and those reporters those uh newspapers write about those things and that creates a a context where we're acting and we're defining ourselves through our interaction with the world and that includes voting and things like that and that is being generated by this working class movement but once the working class movement is is destroyed wherever every working class was put down everywhere from the soviet former Soviet Union to China to uh to Latin America uh of course in the United States uh in the form of Paul Volker just putting a fucking stake in the heart of the working class uh but on because they had already uh there was no sufficient formation uh anywhere to defeat it because we were all to comfortable, the ones who were the most crucial to the system were too comfortable and had been made so, everybody all the suffering was was scattered, the deepest pools of suffering were not touched by political power, they were they were, they had never been allowed to to to uh let sufficient capital formation for stay to allow for uh the intensification of those cultural production that could interact with these structures and and force a voice, there was only there was only the barrel of the gun, the vulker shock was uh, because remember so Stalin thought he was at his best want to give him credit. Stalin thought that at the end of world war 2, he was giving, he was doing a a temporary armistice with the west, he was saying, look, we're beat, we're in trouble, uh, we got our asses kicked or that war, we're we're they have a bomb now, let's just play on their terms until we recover a bit, and that's the under the best uh, the best faith, the most charitable reading of Stalin's thought process was that's what he was thinking, if he cared that much. but uh in hindsight we can see that uh no by by seating to that contest the soviets basically sealed their do and so by the late like the the eastern black had been kept alive through the 70s by high oil prices and then uh western loans to try to create more uh more efficiency in their economy uh and in so doing... they uh became debter nations and once you reach and and of course the Latin American countries that had tried to do uh export or import uh substitution industrialization uh had done that basically at Yankee credit uh and there that meant that all of those working class parties that had emerged and had pursued power and had fought against the reactionary tyde of uh the generals uh such... power that was able to be concentrated was done so under the auspices of uh of this uh investment that was all that was all borrowed and as soon as that interest rate went up it just shattered uh the uh it shattered the political legitimacy basically of all of these less efficient exploiters in the... eastern block, and so as soon as it became a contest for treats, and there's no more uh, the the west was going to make it harder to dispense treats, under those economic, with that political order, well then the people would make the logical conclusion that the political order needed to go, and so the legitimacy of these states collapsed, and what happened is that all these people uh let the doors open to the trogian horse of capitalism that then just showed how much how little it had any concern for uh their input in any of this? but what this means for the culture? is since we're all interacting with the market, interacting with culture as as consumers. Who are related to who the more we matter in the cultural discourse, the more likely we are to vote, the more likely we are to participate in political uh contests and volunteer and and and participate by talking about it to each other and and writing and and creating art about it. We are people have a faith in the system that was bought off by the middle class boom and that is being undermined. that is being eroded every day, but because of the accelerating pace of the technological coersive power of capital, our ability to resist that is never been lower, there is no reflection in our lives of effective class resistance to capitalism, there's a democratic party, but the democratic party does not represent in any way a class project, no one experiences that way, there used to be a class project associated with the democrat. party and it's through that lens that people still assume there is one and that structures their relationship to it, but it's fake, and what that means is that those comfortable fucking home owners who might have been a professional person, might have been a a factory worker, they view through the spectacle of politics through this lens of credulity, and that leans them to either be democrats or republicans, and to accept one or the other of these frameworks of of blame and and and virtue. that is uh the political system acting out the question of who will be sacrificed to the god maloch and the democrats and republicans fight over who is more worthy of moleck's extinguishment and so politics becomes a shadow war between these two cultural demons that we're trying to exercise because we have given up control of the system. we do not believe in it, which means we do not believe it bends to human ends. so we inter, we're still in it because we have individual interests that we need to fucking concern ourselves with, and so everybody at every level, participating, people making art, people making posts, people making podcasts, people running for office, people making tv shows, people trending topics, people donating to campaigns, people volunteering for campaigns, are all operating from this level of belief in the system, born to the fact that they were promise something, their parents something, they were promised it, and therefore they think that there's something they can do to get it back. now, I would say that, even if all the socialists in the world, say they're socialists now, really understand that and have full, clear understanding of themselves, no, I am a worker, sir, I am a worker, I will show you how I'm a worker, even if the... fully uh even if they know what that word means and they're using it correctly and it's not just like through the the the lens that they've been observing it, even if they are uh absolutely aware of themselves as workers, all they can do is act alongside everybody else because there's no collective thing to do except things like vote, and we vote for parties made up of and voted in huge numbers by people who don't think of themselves as... workers, think of themselves as Americans or tax payers, think of themselves as entrepreneurs or would be billionaires, think of themselves as white or black or trans, or male or female or anything, things that everybody feels to some extent, but for these people, it's all, there's no lived experience of class that is expressed through the culture, it was killed, because the conveyor belt from the working class to the creative class was cut because they said we're going to get a deal to you humans. you guys who got a house, congratulations, you keep your house, you have that little bit of equity, you're not going to be ground up immediately and fed into the fucking slurry, you're not going to be turned into paste and bone meal. congratulations, but of course you know over time you're not all going to be able to uh lives of luxury uh, but we're still going to have to figure out a way to to doll this these treats out that keeps you fucking mutton heads in the game and the answer was the knowledge economy, college, the idea that everyone believed at some basic level in the way they acted that the deal was now everybody for themselves, but there is something you can do to ensure at least a minimum level of safety and comfort in life, and that is go to with the country, the 21st century answer after the extinguishment of the frontier, the end of plenty, the end of the myth and the need to start cannibalizing the human race, the answer became go to the go to college, get a knowledge job, there's no more working through, you're not, there's no more clearing land, there's no more struggle to be had, your labor in most ways is is superfluous, it's getting more and more superfluous to these productions because we're doing it elsewhere with greater exploitation and greater uh uh uh profit, but that's just because we're develop, we're uh, we're going to where the profit is as profit declines, we're going and sucking up and hoovering up all the profits that can be extracted through exploitation, through sheer gun to the head exploitation, stripped of political legitimacy or political uh uh uh consent. but we don't live that way, the ones who vote don't live that way, so that means that us boring into this world, we want to be socialists, all that can mean is interacting with the issues of politics as defined by the democratic and republican parties, which represent two formations of middle class nervous breakdown around failing uh, the dying American dream. and they are cosmopolitan uh cosmopolitan capital and provincial capital, the brahmans and the merchants as Thomas Piquetty has called them, that's it, and everyone else is a long for the ride, because with the death of the working class as an engine of politics uh, after taft hartle and and and then the neoliberal consensus, and then the break. of the labor movement and no more forward momentum in labor uh uh organizing and then offshoring removing labor's leverage because oh we're going to close the the plant you're going to go on strike good yeah that'l make it easier for us to get the machines out so that had been broken there was politics had no working class in uh input from the late 70s it was gone, you could argue from 72, it was gone, and so the culture that we're interacting with is one that has not made by working class people, some of them are the children of middle class home owners who are in the middle work. in class, but they went to college, we all went to college, whether you're the son of a of a forklift driver, or a electrician or a fucking uh adman or a cop, you were kid went to college, and the idea was if you follow the rules, absorb the etiquet and social mores that were imparted in these this finishing school, and then gained some technical skill that could be. priced into a market interaction then that you could get your own semblance of what of the of the upwardly mobile, comfortable, consumer-based happiness that your parents had aspired to. now the 60's had seen the kids rebel against that and say, oh no, i don't want that, man, i don't want your gray flanel suit, man, but then at the end when the other when the alternative was was high gas prices and uh and inflation uh and and uneemployment going up and and higher taxes and and less fewer uh fewer vacation days and they were happy to be able to buy in at the ground floor of something because they didn't just get bought out. at the uh at the level of you, you got a a university tenure track position or uh, you know, a job at a uh, like a think tank or whatever the fuck, uh, the other part of that was that the cultural uh restrictions that had been implaced uh by sort of the middle class uh morality of those i can affect the liberation i want, which was always a consumer revelation because i never really lived a working class life, i lived in the suburbs, i lived as a home-owner's child, as a little squire on the fucking uh mansion, the a square a little a little squire uh in the uh the countryside, a little little a little font leroy with with crushed velvet coulots skipping through the little... urban days and then they went to college and the jobs you got out of college that first generation, those were jobs that were relatively intellectually rewarding, gave you a degree of autonomy and some degree that some degree of belief that you chose your profession and they were well compensated, but that was all predicated on this search for profit that was being funneled over to the extent it could be, and as increasing uh crisis. reordered things, the the the treat facet went down, that's why everybody, post World War II is part of one generation, we're all boomers, the only difference is over time, our relationship to technology and our understanding of the horizons of our personal autonomy are different, and that explains everything, because everybody is seeing themselves as a consumer, because that is what they were brought into, the world they were brought into... Post World War II was one of for the people who went on to do politics the most and define these things, not everybody, but for the ones who were the center of gravity of American culture, it was a non-alienated time, that's why they got instantly nostalgic, because they were the only people who ever lived non-alienated lives and college is the peak of non-alienation, and everybody who came out of that machine went through a process of finding that on the other end of that was not the liberation that they've been promised, but just the... same exploitation that their fucking sucker ass dad had had, but only with a shirt and tie, and so you see the disaffection and cynicism of the fucking exers, then you see the just the the anxiety fest of the millennials and now just the dead eyed nialism of the zoomers, it's that horizon of human agency closing. and politics that means everybody participating in politics is participating it on those those terms, the terms of of uh people who are were promised a thing, believed in a thing and are seeing the thing fail to deliver, and are having a crisis one way or another of confidence in democracy and a uh and the systems that they've been uh consenting to participate in their whole lives, and now they're starting to question them, and what that in the way that they'... them is defined basically at the at the wholesale level demographically, and so you have democrats and republicans, capital funding both of them, but then the top level of one being finance capital in Wall Street and all these college educated fancy types with very developed uh moral codes and and and very consider themselves progressive were the end result of the puritan cult of of virtue, because they have defined virtue publicly. because God is dead and they are cosmopolitan capital and then there are people below and they set they fund out this whole shooting match, but at the a personal level they are more favored to the democrats, and then Hollywood, another formation around the creative types who didn't really want to do the dirty work of watching this machine, sausage make itself, they needed more exp, they needed more than mere money, they needed a sense of creative. outlet, they couldn't do political outlet, they tried and failed, but a creative outlet, so hollywood, and then science and and technology, please just let me try to make the world better, make let me allow me to express myself, and so you had silicon valley, and these formations all take and they create a vision of human liberation through the market that becomes the democratic orthodoxy, and it is also world capital consuming the world, and from the... the the the eye of the storm that turns into liberalism, because these are the people who have been living most comfortably the longest and whose faith of the system is most deeply ingrained, and then lower than them, you have the people in the superstructural relationships around them, their kids usually like people in academia and politics, which is also uh for working class, the the the children of working class people, uh who uh also want a middle class life and think of themselves as middle class and then pursue it. Joe Biden is the perfect example of that. Joe Biden is a guy whose... like okay, my business is politics and that's my way of feeling like I'm in charge of something, so that is that's who makes up those strata, and then the voters at large are the lower level versions of that, like k through nine, like uh, teachers, uh, and of course there's also other people voting, but at lower levels, people lower at the totem poll are voting at lower levels, but even within that. you have like in the black community, it's still arrayed around comfort, the most comfortable black people vote and participate in politics the most, it's true with any kind of group you everywhere you want to uh define it, that's how voting is is structured, and so our elections are just these coalitions of different people with different levels of affect for government participating in politics and the main thing you get out of that is democrats and republicans duking it out, but now we're getting. one level, at one end, the hysteria of Q and on and the dream of the day of the rope and and all that, and then on the other you have the liberal Ragnarok around creating like a a new, like having a new cultural revolution around uh like racial justice, and those are both expressions of these this middle-class breakdown, this nervous breakdown among people who self-identify as beneficiaries of the system, no matter what their job is or their background, they self-identify at a basic level as beneficiaries of the system who are trying to get a better deal, and then you have people in socialist counter movements and even if they do believe that they have a class interest and they can only do, they can only respond to the the political structure that is being generated by this this end state of uh neurotic breakdown. like we're witnessing this this breakdown among the middle class mind and we're inmeshed in it in one way or another and we can only participate in it, we can't stand, we cannot participate in it without aiding it, is what i'm saying, we are all providing energy for this this process, but we can't not do that because there's nothing else to do, it just means that we have to put our gaze lower to the ground when we ask ourselves what? is to be done, at every point, at every point, the vet, the the usefulness of this critique in my mind, the usefulness of this line of thinking, the usefulness of my whole approach to politics as a as a as your baseline understanding, is that it clarifies things, we all still have to make the exact same quest, decisions that we had to make yesterday, what we think about what's going to happen, no matter where we think politics is grounded, no matter how we analyze any of these questions, we have the same daily challenges and they pose us always a question of what to choose to do, and we choose wrong a lot of the time because our understanding of what's happening in front of us is in some critical way misaligned with reality. and the the baggage we bring to our lives from our pseudo life in this uh winchester mystery house of middle class neurosis ruling class i guess you would say neurosis either actually ruling class or self-deluted ruling class neurosis it makes you to answer the question, do I need to care about this? a lot easier, and when I see how much, and I know in my own life, how much time people spend preoccupied with questions that in the real scheme of things are irrelevant, is that knowing that or being able to ask that question, do I need to care about this, can really free up mental real estate for other things, like what to do about your direct life, and how to apply your political uh anima, your your your self-directed need to assert yourself in the world, to assert your humanity in the world to express yourself as a being, how are you going to satisfy that unquenchable fire? and I think a lot of it gets misdirected by a steril engagement with these these windmills. so yeah, that's where i'm at with the whole thing is that that our understanding of the grompshian counter-hegemonic dynamic is not operative in the current circumstances in the United States at least there. has to be an emergent working class counter hegemony that breaks out of all of these structures that cannot come from these structures, so it can't be the democratic party, it can't be any of the fucking issues that we're always arguing about, because to get people to act from class consciousness, they have to take those moments when there's a conflict between their class interest as they understand it and their individual identity interest. there has to be a certain degree of uh of thickness of belief in notions of solidarity to withstand a real uh identity-based uh attack. so you can't participate in these questions without assuming that most people are going to put you in a file on one or the other side of this great divide we have between the the the cosmopolitans and the provincials uh the pubes and the grays if anyone's read uh the... dark tower is as a bystander, we can only participate in it as either aloof bystanders or as people who have invested in one or the other at the level of fandom, but then the point where fandom becomes self-identity, like we have fused phandum to ident. so that we care as much about how we define ourselves and what culture we consume as we vote for, and they mean the same thing, and the voting has to be on the terms of this, this nervous breakdown, it has to be on the terms of this sterile culture war, because that's the only game in town, it's that, it's it's what the people in congress are voting on, and it's what culture is producing. It's all we have, so an emergent working class identity is going to form around practical questions of direct tactical use, which means that these big structures of sorting that break us apart will not come into the question. we will not emerge to challenge and break apart uh trust, because everyone will be in good faith working towards the the local goal, and they will put all that other stuff aside, one way or the other, they will put that other shit aside and come to a consensus, and then move forward from that, and then that will create counter hegemany within it, and we can all participate, but for now we are in this, we're suspended in the... goo and it's our job to not go crazy in the goo, it's our job to not decide that we love the goo and that the goo is real and that the goo is life and that if we care enough about the good that it's going to push us in through it, we're going to be able to move through the goo just by sheer will power, we cannot, we cannot will our way to anything, we have to cooperate, we have to humble ourselves, and i'm not i'm saying, i'm not doing a great job I don't think a lot of us are, but that's because we don't have anything to do, and and it's and it is action that brings clarity, and it's the lack of action that creates neurosis, so we just have to not necessarily try to push to the very barrier of where we're going to get resistance, but maybe just ask ourselves, where can we put energy that will leave us feeling less? shitty all the time, it could really come down to that, buse I honestly believe that if you're aware enough of the world and and ideologically aligned enough with reality. to understand the source of pain and alienation in your life and not to allow the the the spectras of of middle class bourgeois breakdown define them for you, that you are seeking the best, I think that if you are on that side, you're trying, it's just you're you're also trying to pleasure yourself, we're all trying to pleasure ourselves, and those two things are at cross, and by denying ourselves easy indulgence to distract, and we have we we can put ourselves to the task of like saying, okay, what, what can I do to help, and of course the question, well, okay, help, how emerges? and the ego wants that to mean, how can I do it in a way that is going to make a difference, but you have to get rid of that part, and if you get rid of that part, it really focuses things, cuz if you're going to act in spite of your having given up hope of it mattering, you can act from the heart, because you're severing yourself from your selfish devotion to action, because you will still feel better, and now you'll know why, as opposed to always wondering what it was, and it requires the leap of faith, that's why it's can't be predicted or prescribed, that's why it's the realm of art more than politics and that's why. I find myself in this weird position as a podcaster strattling the line as everybody blurs politics and art together, turns culture and politics into the same slurry of of uh indulgence and distraction that I am a just a a part of that process that I am an avatar of that of that happening of the the... cast uh eruption is is people who have a desire to live at the pleasure of a system that benefits them, but to be exempt from feeling guilty about it, and there you can do that by trying to affect political change, or by expressing yourself culturally and artistically, and part of the problem for a lot of people is that the political horizons got so uh were constricted so quite fast that all faith in that avenue collapsed almost overnight, leaving only the pursuit of art by the by the by the canny, you know, by the ones that didn't want to be cringe, but not most people aren't very talented is the thing, and it'd be one thing if you wanted to express yourself as a hobby, but having to make it your career, means having a uh deep investment in your ability to do it that makes doing it less fun and more scary and then people just get paralyzed I know I did before that choice until a new thing comes around where hey I could just talk about politics and it'll be entertaining and that's like artistic right it's like art adjacent. It's making people happy, which is better than making them sad, and people get to acknowledge me, and I get some of the validation that I can now only seek virtually, because our conditions are are pretty much set, unless you get wildly lucky and become an avatar for a whole generation of people. so that's why I find myself now having to refine and be like, all right, if this is going to be worth doing, it has to be meaningful, because otherwise it just makes me feel bad and I can't distract myself anymore from what is the source of that because I know it, and that is the power, that's how real class consciousness and right action are formed is that you get stripped to a senturary awareness point. and an interaction with reality that is sharp enough and you maintain and you retain that association and it becomes this planent chord that your brain plays as you encore encounter the world. and it keeps you grounded in a truth that you use to identify everything that happens around you, and so now I'm like, shit, I mean, I probably have to make something that's like more labor intensive, uh, more risky, uh, then whatever this is, and that's what I'm trying to do, and I think that yeah, to the degree to which I feel any anxiety right now in my life, it is in trying to manage that uh, that tension between the the manifest indulgences that I can uh pursue, and my drive to to actually do that, and I'll probably just walk that, I'll probably end up walking that tight rope for the rest of my life, one way or another, unless there's a... big face shift, which very well could happen, but I just trust that I'm walking it for now, I trust that I am holding a balance between and not being pulled from one way or the other, and that that's all I can really go on is that homing beacon in my stomach. but I do think things are going to change for everybody in relatively uh the relatively near future, not catastrophically necessarily, but in a way that when you look back on it you will kind of be like, oh damn, I mean, hasn't that been true of the last year, and that's of course the the the dread, the poisonous mushroom that uh, Felix identified when he says, thing stays the same but gets worse, and that's the perfect description of it, but that's still motion, and you and you don't get motion all at once, you get motion through, a a a gathering towards a breaking point, and we're all going to have to act in that moment, and the decisions we make are going to be guided by what we've been doing until that moment comes, and the other thing is is that moment's not going to be the... same one for everybody, that's not going to be the same one for everybody, that moment is going to be the accumulation of moments, everybody, the twig is snapping under everybody, but it is doing so at an uneven rate, but it is happening to everybody in small and big ways and so that means that we are getting more and more opportunities to confront moments and not to try to bury our head from. or try to incorporate them into our fantasy narratives, which is another bad thing you could do, suffusing your action with the will drawn from conviction, and that is what we lack, the best lack all motherfucking conviction, because there is just so much information isn't there, and there is so much of an expectation that we can come to a logical mastery of the moment that will justify. action because there's no other reason to do anything, that more than anything is what we've been taught, there's no other reason to do anything, other than it is logical, and what logical means is in my self-interest, in the broad scope, logical means to myself interest as i define it. that means nobody believes in any institutions and that means they cannot believe in working within them or resisting them because that would be involving themselves in other institutions that they don't believe in. but i just i i keep myself at the moment balanced on the beam because things are good for me largely. I am pretty content and I do feel like I am moving forward and then it's only when I kind of start self-doubt kicking in and sort of sloth that it gets bad, but then I I kick myself, I pick myself up and get back in the race. I pick myself up and get back in the race, that's life. I get cocked down and I get up again, never going to keep me down, so yeah, stick around if you want more of these nuggets of content that I'm trying to craft into something beautiful, there someone's eyes and feel like it's true, fuck, yes, jack, black jacobin probably Wednesday. I did finish it so we'll talk about the whole thing.
