 I've decided I'm sick of lyrics, it's too hard to remember them when I have the camera on me, easier to just make noises, all right, look at that, it's already going down, that's good. my lens, it's a hot one here, los angeles, folks, finally got it, i felt guilty all summer, watching everybody else get owned by super high temps, but i was always i always remembered momento more, i was like, it's coming for you, september is the month, the cruelest month uh down here in southern california and i'm feeling it, but i'm all right, i got my uh polar black cherry, which for my money uh the best of the... the cellsers, best of the flavored cells, also apparently one of the ones with the highest amount of uh impurities or something, right behind chopochico, which will apparently give you kidney stones or something, i don't know, okay, so today we're gna talk. first again, probably won't talk too long because we haven't gotten to the medi stuff yet, which is going to be about America in the second half, right now we're still setting up Lochman in this book here, first class passengers on a sinking ship by Richard Lachman, we're setting up his concept of hegemany, how it is established and specifically why it declines, and because Lackman is a fucking academic's academic uh, before he even gets to... examining any of his hegemons or would be hegemons, by the way, thank you to everybody who sent me the last valley, apparently there's a HD version on youtube which i will be watching probably tonight, thank you very much, very excited about it, it is astoundingly, it's like basically the only 30 years war movie that anybody ever bothered to make, i mean maybe there's some obscure shit i'm not aware of, but uh beyond that like that's really the only one uh trying to think of anything else that even comes close, not really anything. uh, but anyway, back to Lackman, um, so in the second chapter, money and military success, 1500, 1815, he takes all of the rival theories of hegemonic decline that exist sort of in the ether and in the academy and in popular understanding and scholarship, and breaks down exactly why they ain't shit and vastly inferior uh to... his own concept, have I read Wilson, have I read this bitch, you bet I have, which by the way, I don't recommend anybody read this, no one needs to know the shit in this book, read wedgewood, if you want to read a one volume thing of the of the 30 years war that will get you like a lot of the flavor of it and the interesting uh you know arcs and and allow you and and as an entrepo to you know if you get the virus, the nerd virus and want to read more about it. as a as a like give you you know access to the uh rabbit holes for you want to go down to read wedgewood shorter much more uh uh literary i mean you know she was a 30's historian when when they actually cared about having things uh you know having a pros that actually was fun or interesting or aesthetically pleasing to read Wilson is the thing about this book this is the wildest shit to me if anyone has read this, this is like the uh, the modern sort of capstone, like okay, you want to know what happened in 30 years war, read this one, and it does have everything, you know, it's huge and it's got. the whole war, but the premise of the book, such as it exists is that 30 years war wasn't actually that big of a deal, it didn't do really that much to any of the uh to change any of the structures of Europe at the time uh and uh and then in addition to that the habs the uh holy Roman empire actually gets a bad rap as a dysfunctional political organization because it was working pretty well until the entire uh continent burst into flames and it's kind of baffling to me that you would write a book about this long about that subject with like the desire to basically get people to stop talking about it, very weird, he's English, they're freaks, english historians, absolute mutants, uh, but yes, if you want a one volume, you're not going to get all the nitty gritty details like where all the armies went and all that stuff, but I'm here to tell you, having read a bunch of those books, that shit just... absolutely goes in one ear and out the other and it doesn't really add to anybody's understanding of anything, you've got to be one of those military historian types who like fixate on tactical movements to find it in any way interesting and yeah like that's the stuff that i think i i got into as a kid as civil war as an American civil war nerd but you know you're supposed to move beyond that i honestly feel like if you still fixate on on that element as adult, you're kind of refusing to grow up. Okay, so Latchman is going to go through these other concepts of hegemonic design, or hegemonic decline and basically point out how they do not actually answer the question of how Hejaman's decline and therefore are inferior to his own model, which he will advance in the subsequent chapters, and so he goes through four basic analytical. works: one is decadence, the classic, hard times make uh strong men, strong men make good times, good times make weak men, weak men make hard times cycle, the Joe Rogan uh, facebook potted history that is sort of like the background radiation of like reactionary historical understanding, you now uh moralizing and uh and power serving, and the section here where lachman, he really goes hard against these guys, especially Nile Ferguson who gets owned pretty good in in this section uh, where he just points out, there's absolutely no uh analytical riger to any of this, it's it's it has no, it it offers no mechanism, and it also includes just absolute fraudulent uh information uh, for example Nile Ferguson talking about American decline claims that it's because we don't have the guts to actually own our imperial designs and create like crops of dedicated civil servants who will go around the world like the uh and and assert american hegemony the way that the raj that the British did with the Raj in the 19th century uh and that the reason we do we're uh we're failing to do that is partially because we're spending too much damn money on social security and medicare and not enough on military uh and lachman shows pretty quickly like well that's completely made up like uh social expenditure has not really gone up in 40 years uh what has happened is the tax revenue has collapsed. and that he doesn't say it, but I mean, I know enough from reading other things from Lochman and from uh, you know, reading the beginning of this book, and his specific theory of elite conflict within polities causing them to not be able to function at the capacity that they might theoretically have, uh, that that's a result of elite meddling and elite conflict, no, no, no, we're not going to pay to maintain the the the uh hegemony that benefits us. and there's no central authority that can make us, so those guys out the window, fuck you, you suck idiots, obviously uh, then you've got demographic and ecological explanations for decline, uh, name checks Jared Diamond in this, but most of those theorists aren't talking about modern hegemons and don't really have anything to say about modern hegemonic decline uh and there hasn't a lot of actual work done to compare demographic or ecological conditions uh there is a theory of of that a population uh that population growth beyond you know it's uh stable point uh is undermining but that doesn't really you don't really see that or at least lackman implic implies that you don't really see those sort of demographic pressures in these cases of actual hegemons that decline, which means that's not responsible for hegemonic decline uh, then he goes, more much more respectfully he addresses world systems theory, wallerstean and oriegi. and he says world world systems theoryy has a lot to uh recommend it as a analytical framework for understanding how capitalism specifically uh operates on a global scale, but it is very vague on internal dynamics within hegemonic polities, and so it is unable to answer questions of decline because it does not specifically address those. uh, and then for the and then in the fourth. uh chunk of this, the final chunk of the of the second chapter, he takes uh people to task who uh, whose theory of state power and and and hegemonic dominance and then decline revolves around, pure just material access, material resource access, the states that are able to access the most funds and are able to operate from the the highest material condition, are able to dominate until uh the second and third rate power is gang up on them and then they decline uh, but uh, with a number of very convincing charts at the end of the chapter, lackman points out that that's not really the case historically. there are tons of examples from the early modern era on of the largest, most powerful, richest states getting their asses kicked in colonial and and continental wars by much smaller powers, and in in some cases smaller powers punching way above their weight and don't necessarily see a dynamic of cooperation against the hejamon so much as a hegemon just failing to access its theoretical state capacity and so lachman ends the chapter like okay so why then did these did the first attempted hegemons of the early modern European erapsburg Spain and then uh Burban France and then Napoleon later. who made it gas grasp for hegemonic power were for a moment the apex most powerful, most rich polities in Europe, but were and we're able to build significant colonial empires, but could never actually achieve higemony and ended up declining in the face of dutch and then English power, and so to answer that question, we turn to this chapter three, uh, fuck, I didn't write down the name of chapter. because I'm a dumb ass, why didn't I do that? I'm so stupid. Uh, chapter three, Spain and France, military dominance without hegemoneny. So he starts with the Spanish Hapsburgs. We all love the Spanish Hapsburgs book, we don't we folks, first off the gate, create this massive uh, incredibly rich American colonial empire, but all as soon as it, almost as soon as it's built and starts pumping unpress'. amounts of silver into the European economy, uh, it begins the process of undermining and dooming uh the Spanish Spanish power, and you look at the resources they had to access and you say, how did that happen, and lashman's answer is it comes down to the specific array of forces and powers that dominated in Iberia when colonial project began, specifically the fact that... the royal power that eventually was able to claim united control of the Iberian peninsula after uh the Portuguese war in the 181580s uh the Habsburg monarchy there uh was only able to gain that preeminence by striking deals with the regional military aristocrats who had done the actual work of reconquering the peninsula from uh Muslim powers uh like that is... the specific context of Spain is that it it had the historical reality of having been dominated by Muslim Emirates, which over years were pushed back, but pushed back by local Christian Catholic warlords who were able to exercise military dominance in their regions, and the trastar trastamaras and then the Habsburgs who came after them were only able to sit a top power in Spain by granting - essentially regional autarchy to the military aristocrats of Spain at the expense of the peasants and the towns and because they essentially did not have uh the the the royal family didn't have a independent power base to counterveil that author the power of the aristocrats and essentially had to sign off on their power that that's the reality of these dynastic uh struggles and and the rise of these dynastic families in the early modern era atop these new powerful... is that they got there largely not through conquest within their polity but by uh a seeding to the existing power structures that existed locally and in Spain that meant these autarchic military aristocrats, and an autarchic autarchic military aristocrats aren't big on giving uh money to a central government to create independent bureaucracy uh to extend state capacity at their expense, at the expense of their private power, which meant that when it was time to actually administer these colonies that they had established in the middle east and Asia, they were forced to create feudalism in the American context rather than impose a state project of extraction there uh if anybody knows from uh from junior high history the inkomenda system everybody knows the inkomenda system anyone enkomianda and that was uh a system whereby because the state didn't have the capacity to actually settle and dominate and impose its will in the new world uh it gave land grants and more importantly the grants to the labor of all of the natives found on that land to uh the aristocratic and uh but not all aristocratic many of them commoners just you know trying to raise up in the world who uh went over there and actually did the the the the work of the crown of spreading catholicism. and and Habsburg rule there uh and what that meant is that while there was a system to send silver, send money, send the fruits of a trade back to Spain, uh, over time Spain got a smaller and smaller percentage of the wealth made in the colonies, because the local powers there, the let the inkomenda uh rulers became their own autarchic aristocratic uh barons who were... were jealously guarded it, kept it home, defied the mercantile demand to only trade with the Spanish crown, uh, and while the port of the city of Seville became the entrepo for all uh new world trade, uh, they were never able to the the civil traiders were never able to assert control over the producers in the colonies, the way that uh, the dutches, the the way that the trader, the merchants of uh Amsterdam and London were able to do. for the later uh hegemonic colonial empires, and you get a situation eventually where Spain sends colonial administrators from the Metropole to the colonies who then have to contend with these deeply embedded local power structures where uh American Spanish aristocrats are sitting on top of existing networks of like native social structures. that they have a command of and access to the resources of and the colonial administrators basically just have a piece of paper with the king's signature on it, which you in the jungles of Venezuela doesn't really uh put go very far. and so you have this push and poll between the colonial elites and uh and uh imperial officials uh, meanwhile you have fortunes being vast private fortunes of of of Spanish subjects being built in the new world, giving those fortunes influence back in Spain, and you have this dynamic occurre where the colonial power, the colonial elites, the new colonial. Elites are able to assert more influence in the Metropole of Spain in Madrid than the Metropol is on the colonies and that means that even though there's this vast wealth being pulled out of the ground in Latin America, it's mostly staying in Latin America, it is not going to the uh funding of state capacity that could have created what they call that virtuous cycle uh that builds up uh a a state capable of not. only defending its territories, but defending its geopolitical status in Europe among its rivals and so you have Spain being the subject of every other major power in Europe's uh fear and suspicions uh you see this group these cycling of alliances against Hapsburg Spain that run all the way through the 30 years war they're swat they're getting swatted by everybody they're they're like a elephant getting stabbed by a thous uh spears, they can't even fucking put down the dutch revolt, which is just this fraction of their population with a fraction of their resources. because all the resources are just bleeding away because they don't have the capacity, and now what is that boil down to? the fact that the entire Spanish state structure was premised on this uh network of independent basically aristocrats who had no individual interest in seeing the crown really advanced, and so that the Spain became un incapable of defending its own power. and soon enough the French were able to overcome them, uh, the 30 years war is a big part of that, that really does help put significant rishlu and the French are able to use their diplomatic uh skills and their vast resources because they're the other richest country in uh Europe at the time, to isolate the Spanish and to eventually see a large part of their territory, their not uh, not their... new world uh colonies which are largely left alone, but a large chunk of their European uh empire uh take it pulled away from them uh simultaneous revolts in Portugal and Catalonia that lead to Portugal permanently re-detaching from the Iberian Union and I mean and it was not that the Spanish crown was not aware of this count Duke Olivarez who was the... minister of Philip made an attempt to centralize authority in Spain, the the Union of Arms in 1625, that was an attempt to actually make every elite within Spain responsible for Spain's military uh success, make them all have to fucking kick in, but they of course resisted it, retreated to their regional strongholds and undermined the authority of the of the royal family at every time. so although the Habsburg state was precocious relative to other states in its power and capacity in the 1500s by the end of the 17th century uh they have entered into a irreversible decline which is picked up then uh which gives the option then for the French who after uh the front is put down which is their own revolt because they spent a shit ton of money and alienated their own elites to try to defeat the Spanish, which led to their own peasants and aristocrats to revolt at about the same time, uh, but in their case, that led to the triumph of the uh, absolute state in the person of King Louis The 14th who is able to centralize authority in the crown, but how does he do it? He does it in a way that yes, firmly establishes royal prerogative over the... but does it at the expense of the dynamism and uh and ability to uh to effectively extract resources uh that would have allowed them to continue to successfully compete with the other European powers. what what uh lewy does is that he uh keeps the elites within France, the aristocrats, the towns, the land owners, from unifying against the royal family and and and making them all relying on the royal family by making the most lucrative path of uh investment and the most lucrative thing to do with your money if you were a elite in France to purchase a state office and state offices become the object of competition among the imperial uh the French elite now that does secure Louis you know he builds versay, he makes all the uh high aristocrats move from their homes, their chateaus and spend the zillion dollars living in Versaille and hanging out at his garden parties and putting on arsenic based makeup and calling each other horrors or whatever the hell, doing doing uh bants and zingers just trying to stay stop dying from bordum before they die of syphilis, but it comes at a cost, and what that cost is is that? when France is able to uh, coming in late, but uh, so france is able, they they they have to come from behind, because the at the exact same time that uh, like karibian and and Latin American colonies are becoming like really lucrative is when the French wars of religion are basically making it impossible for the French to commit to any kind of uh real colonial. uh policy, only after the wars of religion and they able to actually seriously try to start uh a colonial enterprise, but the insight the incentive to invest in colonies is undermined by the fact that for the colonial elites of france or for the uh for the uh the economic elites of France, the highest return for of any money is going to be to buy offices, so that means that uh french colonies become wildly undercapitalized, they end up... having to depend on English and Dutch and Portuguese trade roots, slave networks to to get labor for their colonies and to get to get the resources out of their colonies, so they end up having to sell for example a lot of the Caribbean sugar to Dutch middlemen and then give up therefore a bunch of the profits to the Dutch just to get it off the island because they lack of uh the lack of capital investment in the... metropolitan uh manufactured goods that that is a vast mass that is a huge economic stimulus and uh that was never built in any of the French colonies. the riches friends colony of course was sandaman Haiti where all the money was kept by a very small group of uh ultra rich planners who spent it on luxuries much like they did in the south of the United States which... is not what you want, the the the the vast majority of ahasians were slaves who didn't have any consumption, they weren't buying shit, having uh, having colonials buying stuff from you, having your colonials buy the product of your shophoses and workhouses and and your trade networks is a huge moon to the economy and a huge uh source for state revenues that you can use to fight the other fucking European states, and the French were just unable to harness their colonial powers until they got lapped by the the Dutch and the British and then the and then had it basically taken from them, first with uh first by losing Canada in the seven years war and then of course uh losing sant demang and the Caribbean, most of the Caribbean holdings during... uh the after with the Haitian revolution and and the Napoleonic wars. Now the French do come back under Napoleon and make a grab for hegemony that is spectacularly successful in the in the short run and that absolutely destroys all those old uh barriers to effective state capacity. The the Napoleonic empire uh is not one with independent sources of power. that those have all been wiped away by the guillotine and by the French revolution uh and and a military aristocracy basically, a a meritocratic, liberal military aristocracy governs the entirety of the napoleonic empire, but and and in that way it it uh, it shows the only like effective way that any power could feesibly assert continental gemany uh and the... that Hitler tried to assert continental hegemany uh hundred so years later, but a permanent conquest regime in the modern era is simply not feasible in the long run or even in the medium run and so napoleon got and that's the end of France's uh plays for hegemmany, so you got these two states, one that got there that started building an empire early, built an incredibly wealthy uh resource rich empire but didn't have this the state structures capable of turning that into Germany and then the French who had uh more they had they have always been the richest, most populous, most agriculturally bountiful European polity, and that's geographic, that's largely a geographic uh response because of that like I called it the hexagon earlier, they call France the hexagon sometimes, it's... fully, it has natural borders all around it, basically uh, and within those natural borders you have this just vastly uh, rich agricultural territory, which in its own way helped retard France's um uh economic growth, but all but one of the and uh capitalism doesn't really catch on in France the way that it does in Spain uh in large part because independent individual uh legally recognized land tenure which becomes the cornerstone of uh the European political the British political economy that ends up dominating the world cannot really be asserted in France until the revolution uh because of these competing uh elite networks all of whom are making claims uh historical feudal uh rights-based claims on resources and on state offices does not allow for the uh centralized administration of private property, that is the key to the British, brenner, I think is is is, I honestly don't get that there is a necessary conflict between Brenner and Wallenstein at the end of the day, because I feel like the Brenner explanation for how capitalism begins with land tenure in the British countryside is correct, but how it spreads and how it becomes dominant in the world. "I think has never been more well elucidated and explained than through Wallenstean and Arige and the world system stuff, so I don't know why they got to fight. So these, so in that chapter, we are dispensed with these two forces that materially should have been able to assert continent, but just weren't able to do it because of the nature of their elite instit, there uh, the nature of elites within their country, and the the competitive framework that it can never." be resolved from the center, so uh next week we'll talk about the next two chapters, which are about two hegemons that actually were able to estab or would be hegemons that actually are able to do it, briefly in the case of the Dutch, much longer in the case of the English, but in both cases eventually brought down, eventually humbled, although not in the way obviously that they deserved, you know, like considering the worldwide monstrous bloodleding that goes into building a hegemmon like that, by all rights, the dutch and the English shouldn't exist as people uh, but you don't get justice in this world, and we'll be talking about that uh next week, those two chapters, and then after that we will get to the second half of the book, which is all about applying this concept of elite conflict leading to hegemonic decline to the contemporary United States, so uh so let's take some questions now for maybe a half an hour or so if any of that made sense, i do like it, it's academic, he's a he's you know, the man's clearly an academic so it's a little dry, but it reads very quickly, he doesn't use the, he doesn't get lost in his clauses the way a lot of academics do, but it's a very um he he is so focused on applying like the... political framework and the lens to everything that it makes reading it very uh, it makes like getting his point as he's is he's making it very easy because uh, because he's not letting anything like kind of extraniously just go un uh not put not put nothing good nothing is uh nothing doesn't get put through the ringer you know uh of his the analytical framework so i like it i did not see Brandon's speech uh, the fact that people are shitting them pants because of fucking picture of him with with like red lighting is hilarious to me, you could not, i'm sorry man, if you're laughing at January 6th and saying it's uh, it's it's hilarious watching liberals cry over it, which yes it is, you cannot start wetting your pants because some of the most tedious dorxs in uh Washington dc. decided it would be epically uh hilarious to take their 90-year-old fossilized senile quote unquote boss and set him up for a fucking meme uh speech and photo opportunity, I mean just show some fucking self-respect, good lord, nothing has changed about Brandon, he is the same uh doughtering dufis he's always been, because these guys figured out a way to just repeat the same cringe inducing meme bullshit that the the Trump people did, all of a sudden you have to be afraid of him, i mean my god, if you don't want more evidence that these people are mirror fucking image. of each other, that there is no difference between any of them, and the thing that really makes the no, by the way, the thing that actually makes there no real practical difference between either of these groups of people, is that they are both voting for parties, because all of this, all of this strum and dong, all of this shit, all these, all of it is just to reassure one group or another of people who vote democratic or republican. both parties have a long-term teleology towards nuclear war with China. "the only question, the only real difference between these two parties is which coalition they imagine going to war with China with. now yeah, like you got the anti-war uh, you know, geniuses who've decided that the that trump republicanism is some sort of antidote to uh militarism, LOL, but every single one of them will tell you that like if they hate, if the..." against the war in Ukraine and America supporting it, it's because that's taking the b the the eye off the ball revisa v China and because they think we should be alying with Russia against China. The fantasy is that you can cut off globo homo and have a uh a new coalition of based white republics uh go to war with China on behalf of like a white world Supremacy which is you know that's insane. death drive mana, but the the democratic response is, no, no, no, it's the US and and the EU uh against China and Russia, but either way, it's a war with China, just a question of the alliances behind you when it happens, so like there's no, there's no side here that's going to rescue. from the worst outcome, there's no side here that's going to provide a harm reduction, which both sides love to talk about, um, yeah, somebody keeps asking about the Pakistani floods, man, that's boy, not good, that's for sure, don't know what the fuck else you're supposed to say about it. I mean when you when you consider a thing like that I think the only the only way to really like stay saying is to uh take the long view you know to to try to get your way personally to whatever through whatever coubler off cycle you own you have whatever whatever fantasy you might have been cleaning to of personal immortality or uh or social transcendence and just know you know like everything is cyclical, nothing is permanent. I mean, I don't, I do not have any hope that like horrors like that are going to spur any kind of like real reconsideration of uh of the global political economy. I mean, that is the conceat of... ministry of for the future right, that like 10 million people die in India and it actually makes people start taking things seriously, I mean 80% of livestock in Pakistan dying, I don't see it making any anybody take anything seriously, yeah there's Chinese heat wave that basically went uncommented upon, the we we are too, we are in a horrifying situation where we are fully aware of almost all the horrors in the world at a finger at a few. strokes we can have access to all the world's horrors and we can be aware of how they connect to one another and how we they connect to us in our lives and how we benefit in some abstract way from from things as they as they are, but we have absolutely no individual ability to do anything about them, which is a situation that nobody in history has ever had to deal with, previous people have gone through apocalyptic cycles of decline, but never. with some sort of understanding of it being a totalizing phenomenon. but yeah, i mean things are going to get worse obviously, but we're all still just got to live, man, fuck, i don't know, you can't use it as an excuse is i guess the only thing that... I think of, because you don't help anybody, using as an excuse to to destroy yourself or to not extend your... yourself to other people, to not to not reach out, to not make an effort, that's only short changing yourself and only robbing the time you do have that we all have of the potential for meaning, but yeah, certainly horrifying. Yeah, the one thing that you you nobody is going to get is is some clean break that allows them to uh to not have to be with themselves anymore, you know, you're going to be there no matter what, and so you have to decide what that means, who you are, and that is something that we have control over, even though you know every institution. and every uh social phenomenon of life kind of insists that the opposite is true, that we are these reafied beings who are kind of doomed to cycles of misery, and I think you need to do that because the big thing that I am the big thing that that makes me despair about the American situation specifically is that people don't have any obviously faith in the future or in each other or in government to do anything for them, but we still do all know just by our day-to-day experience that power resides somewhere and that there is the power of life and death that can be exercised, but only to punish. and what i think we're we're going to be looking at in the future here is this cyc these cycles of punishment and scape goat seeking to to amongst those people who are still like cleaving to politics as a solution it can only solve things by providing that sort of ritualized catharsis not by uh solving any problems. but you know that doesn't feed anybody and people are still going to be hungry so i got to say uh both so naristos and brazil in general taking a huge l that's guy doesn't even remember to put a bullet in the gun, what the hell happened? he like he had the safety on or something, my guy in Japan fucking built his own functioning trebuchet to kill the fucking pormer prime minister, volson aristo's blown the fuck out, i don't know, i mean i can see it like you say why would you want to shoot the why would a brazilian guy want to shoot? Krishna, I mean the whole like the the Brazilian right is like our right, they're all beset by paranoid fantasies of being encircled, I mean in their case like you know Brazil is at this point encircled by uh more leftist regimes anyway uh, apparently he was a rockabilly too, I saw a picture of the guy, the Brazilian Teddy Boy Greg trying to kill the vice president, embarrassing. you put the bullets in backwards, jesus christ, jesus fucking christ, how do you, how do you fuck that up? the okay, so this that honestly makes me think it's a Bob Roberts situation and the whole thing was a setup to boost the kershners and uh the the that wing of the peronist uh movement, in which case hey well done, like i don't, you got to do what you got to do. You know, you can't be squeamish at this late date. Okay, yeah, you can't, yeah, everything is uh, everything is a hall of mirrors and shadows, no, there's no way to assert any confidence and the truth of anything, I mean, obviously we've always been living in fabricated realities, but if everybody sort of has a base commit. to the fabricated reality, it transcends the fabrication and becomes material and true, and that that is what is fraying, that is why to be incredibly dorky about it and uh cringe, the only answer to any of these questions is is love in any form you can find it, because It's the only thing that can't be fabricated, because it is not received intellectually and processed intellectually the way that our consensus reality is, it is perceived and processed emotionally, it it arises from experience, the whole of experience, not just a abstracted thread of. symbolic representation of experience. Uh, man, Europe, this winner, England, ooh, I don't know how the Brits are going to handle that, but they the thing about the Brits though is they're siccos, they love that shit, like they all wish it was the... because that was the last time they had fucking purpose, that was the last time they had any goddamn purpose and meaning in their lives, or they imagined that that was the case, of course none of them actually live through it, it's a fantasy of of meaning through collective suffering, but of course it is not collective suffering, it is only individualized suffering happening at the same time. Will the UK end in the next 10 years? I mean, I think this winter is going to be a real stress test, we'll see. Where does power exist now? I think the reason we're all freaking out so much is that power has has vacated human human agence, power no longer resides in human agency. There are people in positions of power, obviously, and those positions of power. have more concentrated power over the world than has ever existed in any concentrated form in human history, but the power resides not in the office holder, but in the office, the person in the room, the person in the chair is completely fungible, and I think that is a new, that is a, that is a new uh, that is a new arrangement in human affairs that is only made possible because of our... technological, social structure, now of course, theoretically, we have all as humans the power to pull this whole thing down and to get into the T800 and change its programming, but we would have to believe that, and we would have to believe in each other to act to... to make that happen, and once again, that belief is not going to come from uh, some consensus understanding of events, it's going to come from experiential. love alloying and uh and and cycling up within people cooperating together. people are, i got to say, i got to wonder about the China everyone say you know, people talk about blessed chairman g saving us and all that, but uh, it does. not seem like they really have a plan either. i mean yeah they're creating you know a uh this belt road network and and and the the state party is still has the whip hand uh visa v this all these you know public private enterprises but it still is caught in the cycle of in order to maintain its legitimacy needing to offer middle-class lifestyles to a population that cannot possibly live that way. yeah, like if the Chinese inherit the world, it's not going to be the whole world, it's just... is going to be wherever they can uh project power in a context of completely failed supply lines, and at that point can you have a, can you maintain a central authority or do you lose the mandate of heaven? I don't know. uh, everything is fucked, everybody sucks, as uh, the bard himself, Frederick Durst once said, but that's fine, we're all here right now, nobody in this chat is currently uh, in hysterical misery, at least I hope not, if you're in hysterical misery right now, you should probably be doing something else uh. unless this is distracting you from that, in which case, happy to help. okay, so oh, somebody asked about hell, hell on earth, good, i have a couple of plugs, one is of course for the podcast which will come out in the fall, we're shooting for maybe november, we want to get it out before the beginning of the before the end of the year. but well so we have about half of it written and uh and the first four recorded but not fully you know edited or whatever uh so we're on a good pace I think it's going to be very good I'm very proud of it uh but the other one is that next Thursday I it'll probably be around 6 eastern we'll see though uh I am going to be playing on Twitch here uh Europa Universalis with some very friendly nerds who uh are very good at it and have offered their help in leading me through a campaign so uh we'll probably do something uh 30 years war related you know like maybe uh maybe try to unify Germany before it can fall apart we'll see. I don't maybe maybe try to like be get pressua to exist early I don't know we'll see. i thought it's kind of wanted to see how far you could push the uh venesian republic like could you could you could you get Venice to like hold together and become uh an independent power that is able to prevent the Italian wars from basically destroying all of those uh uh early capitalist uh nodes that had been built. and and pushing uh the uh pushing the focal point of British or of European like trade and and manufacturing uh up north into the low countries in England. Good old dondalo motherfucker was 95 years old when he led the when he led the crusaders into Byzanthium. I don't know, I'll probably get owned and it'll be very frustrating, but we'll see. I've just, I've been wanting to play one of these with somebody who knows what they're doing uh, and they they look like they can help me out. Oh, I will certainly try to ignore the chat. Oh, I don't know if I'm watching that Lord of the rings thing. Tolkin, I watched all those movies in the theater. the original lord of the rings movies and i always like was like that was fine, but it never really got me, and then I watched I think one and a half of the hobbit movies, I watched the first one, then I had a friend who liked it more than I did, so I would go with him, I think I fell asleep during desolation of smogue and then I never saw uh the third one at all, which is the one with the big battle in it, I couldn't even be bothered. and this is like this isn't even any of those guys, it's some assholes i never heard of from the second age, i don't even what the fuck that is, nobody's fucking, no thank you, uh, it'll be a this, the stream will be on this channel, it'll be chappo. the highest score i've ever buled, that's an interesting question, what i had like one 2:30 one time, i got around 2:30, that's definitely the best i ever did, that was why. but most usually i'm sub 100, i don't know, maybe it wasn't 2:30, it's been a while, that sounds high now that i think about it, 300 is the best, was it that high? it was like 180, i don't know, it was it was in the high, it was around 200, i don't know, i'm terrible at chess, i'm awful at chess, one of the worst at chess, also you can't bust my balls for being bad at bowling, i'm literally disabled, okay, that's fucking abilism, um, i'm terrible at chess, i make moves that always lead in disaster, and i i honestly my fiance amber pointed out kind of why this happened is that i hate having to choose to to make a move, i hate it, i'm a libra, i hate it, and so i think what i do is i subconsciously pick the move that will make me lose as fast as possible so that i have to stop thinking about it cuz it's like it's just that kind of me is like hell having to make like very consequential decisions that i am not confident about. i'm a big uh, yeah, there's a reason that this is what i do, that i don't actually like have any responsibilities cuz i'm not built for it. I mean maybe that'll change, probably will in my lifetime, we'll see, might have to make some changes, but uh, situations will dictate that, I can't really try to force it, I think for me it's just like, it it's it's it's not so much anxiety of making the choice of which which way to go as it is, like I don't know. why one is better than the other and so it annoys me, yeah, I'm definitely more of a trosky, stab me in the head. All right, so this is an hour, finished it up, so next week we'll be back with chapter, the next two chapters, chapters three and four, chapter three are about those dis'. monsters, the dutch, and then chapter five is about the the the reptiles, the the people who like discovered an ancient obelisk while digging around in their countryside, and then we're all inthralled to its evil power, the British, whose uh, whose demonic inthronment in the world, we have only ever, we've never escaped, all America ever did was uh... was just takeover leadership of a machine uh built there on that fucking becursed isle but on foundations made by those hustling scratchy scrappy Dutch all of whom of course did their uh success win on you know piles and piles of corpses so next week we'll talk about that bye-bye stay cool.
