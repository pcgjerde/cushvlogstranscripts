 Okay, that's me. All right, here we go, and we're back, uh, I know it's been a long time since I rapped at you guys, as Jim Ancower used to say, but uh, shit has been going down as you know, uh, and honestly the main reason I didn't haven't really been uh streaming is cuuse I didn't want to say anything that everyone else was saying or that was misinformation or that was speculation I didn't want to add noise because it seemed like there was a shit ton of noise uh because I mean we've talked about how this quarantine was slowly being unraveling as people realized that no help was coming and that nothing was undergirding anything anymore, that we really are uh uh that were really they're on our own that that there's nobody coming and how that situation was due was sustained due to the fact that we were all apart, we were all segregated by employment and race and and and quarantine and didn't and no one knew what to do and no one knew what to rally around and in that moment as I mean the reason that the quarantines are were already talking about being wrapped up even before this, I think Koomo last a week ago was announcing that they were gonna start unraveling the quarantine in early June here in New York without you know any... compensation for all the loss of life or uh income or the failure of to the the complete failure to to do anything about this so people already wanted out and in and we're coming to the realization that they were going to be coming out and that all of that time indoors had been for nothing. all it was a time for you to wait around and lose your job and have nothing uh nothing done for anybody and for 100 thousand people to die without anyone really even noticing or saying anything about it, and so in that fucking video of that pig just sitting on a guy's fucking neck for eight minutes and staring into the camera, i mean i understand why they thought they could get away with that, you know, like a lot of people q and on types and shit are obsessed with the idea that there was some sort of false flag that the guy's the ben Bailey from cash cab or something because seems so, it is so outrageous, even compared to your other police shooting videos because of the of the the cold bloodedness of it, the complete uh, the complete lack of any humanity in it, the and not even emotion, just in passive, almost bored, look on the fucking guy's face, and that's why people assume, a lot of people assumed this had to be some sort of scam, this had to be some sort of provocation, but i mean look at where we were, look at what we've been putting up until that point. h you know like i said us senator telling people who are out of a job which is what 40% of the population at this point almost that hey fucking people in hell need ice water too motherfucker good luck and that impassive look that just willingness to be filmed murdering someone it comes from the same realization that's filted throughout every level of control of the society that like we're broken we're broken people and there's really nothing we're going to do about it, and maybe two months into the pr, maybe two months into the quarantine that would have been true, but uh, we got to a point where people got to a point where just it wasn't, it wasn't going to do it anymore, they weren't going to be able to put up with it anymore, because that sweet suspension that most Americans, even poor ones are in in America where you have this massive police apparatus designed to keep people cow, but you also have some thin layer of of um of material and creature comforts and also the thin uh hope that you could potentially. improve your situation uh through striving or whatever the fuck, all of that is gone, all that's left, uh, that the the the uh, the carrot, coronavirus destroyed the carrot, and all that was left is the stick, and this and right in your face uh, and the thing about that is is that the stick loses a lot of its coersive power if people don't think that there's anything to lose, and that's where we are now. and so people, people fucking did something, and I think one of the big reasons that it's that the protest spread so quickly outside of Minneapolis after that first night of of uh of fighting was seeing that you could do a thing like burn a fucking police station, but you could actually do it, something that had never really been done before, and so now people are doing it all over the country, and the question a lot of people are. and and and you've seen, at least I've certainly seen this paralysis, this this, everyone was in stasis, and now everything is moving, we talked about how that that's how it works, you get you get into a fixed position, something interceeds, it breaks open the consensus and now things are fluid again uh in a different way, and like we were in a bubble, we were in this quarantine bubble that popped, and it was going to pop at some point, and this is what was going to pop it. uh and this is what popped it. now what's going to happen next is the real question and no one knows and i feel like one of the big reasons that some though, i'm trying to makes i'm trying to be clear here, it's very difficult because obviously this is a fluid and and and dynamic and and incredibly dramatic historic. situation, but I don't want to get on my hobby horse uh about the internet, but like looking at people try to make sense of this thing online really reminds you that you can't make sense of anything online, it's not designed to do that and it can't do that, uh, because so you have the protests and of course along with those you have. burning of buildings and cars and and looting and and immediately that becomes a moral question that people have to adjudicate or feel that they must adjudicate because that's how we've been trained to understand politics as observing situations and then forming opinions about them and so the question becomes um who's doing this looting is it is it uh anarchists is it anafa is it the cops is it's provocator uh is it regular people who are frustrated. is it good or bad? uh, because if it's good, then we should help, or then maybe we should be involved, if it's bad then we should shun it, but that isn't arrelevant question, uh, I would say the answer to the question of who's doing it, all those different options, yes, I mean, we've already seen video of cops smashing windows themselves and smash cops piling up bricks, cops clearly think that allowing things to get burned, allowing things to get smashed, last night in uh Manhattan uh, soho in the midtown got smashed up and all those awful stores got looted with cops blocks away in giant p giant groups, clearly uh, that's because they wanted it to happen, because they think that if these protests are are uh destructive enough, that America's middle-class propriety will overwhelm any sense of um, any sense of... justice any sense of anger at the failure of the status quote to provide for anybody and not even prevent them from joining because they probably weren't going to join anyway, most people aren't going to join, rather they're going to look the other way or even uh be okay when the live ammo comes out or the the mass arrests start as in like filling stadiums and and shit with people uh like that's clearly the the the hope of the police and what sustains that? hope is the fact that so many people want more than anything to be right before they do anything, because the internet provides us with a fantasy that we can know what the right thing to do is in any situation that we can have enough information about the dynamics of a fluid situation like a nationwide spontaneous outburst of protest that we can determine oh uh these people are doing it for x, it can only result. in this, therefore I should either involve myself or sit it out, which is why you see a lot of people on the first night saying, this is the revolution, this is happening, we will take over, obviously that's delusional. but they need to tell themselves that this is it to motivate them to do it. now on the other hand, you have the people saying, oh what are you doing? uh, don't you know corporations actually love uh uh riots, they think it's cool, who gives a shit what they think? it's branding, it's pr, they're not involved, unless you think target has like shooters out there doing their own uh looting, it's just ass covering, because at this point it is just uh a series of protests that don't have any connected. uh demands or organization as because we don't have a left to this country, we don't have a movement opposed to capitalism at any level, all we have are discrete people who whose alienation they process in discrete ways and it's and so black people because they are a separate group within America and are treated as such and live as such have a more acute understanding of that alienation that will lead them to take sta take a stand collectively in a way that is much harder for any other groups to pull off, but that's that doesn't mean that whatever this is can't become something more than it is, and the thing that's going to make that happen is people have to fucking just make the choice to accept that they can't know that you can't know where anything is going to lead, you want to be able to say to yourself by doing enough post-reading, okay, this is all adventurism, there's no... politics to this, i'll stay home then. okay, congratulations, enough people do that, then you've ensured that that's what's going to happen, because and but especially for white people, there is this, this uh, this crisis of, what is my place in this? what is my place in this contest? do i i don't want to crowd out black voices or whatever the hell, and that's why you have this cakkamy blackout thing today, um, but one of the... reasons that people that there is that divide and that uh that this this um protest happened along racial lines before they happen along any more abstract class line uh is because of the segregation of American life and the only way to change that is through action, the only way to build the connections, the word that gets thrown around around a lot here, solidarity to create organs. of deliberation, decision-making and uh coordination that are going to be necessary to push back against whatever is coming next, that's going to be built in the streets, it's going to be built in the process of doing things, it might not be, but if it but it can be and it's only will there, so I think more than anything people need to give. any idea that they can out smart this thing, that they can figure it out, that they can have a take on it that is all encompassing, and so that only leaves your your need, your moral and and just for your own personal preservation, because what we're staring down right now is a is a complete collapse of any uh social order other than pure coersion, the the... the terminator face be revealing itself completely and the only thing being left, the the the carrot completely going away for everybody, so that so so that your thought as as someone who is more uh removed and and and protected from the worst deprivations of this collapse uh than people in the streets, that's not going to last, the prophets are still going away, they're still eating the seed corn, they're still selling the fucking popper copper wiring and stripping the pipes. It's only going to get worse, but the budgets for cops are only going to get bigger because it's the only public service that they need, until of course they could privatize that completely, but for now that's not on the table, and if we're going to def, if we're going to stop them from doing this essentially, uh, the only way to do that is to build collaborative organizational power against it, which does not exist and cannot be built by the internet. cannot be built by posting, cannot be built by hashtagging, cannot be built by uh instagram post, it can only be built by experience, it can only be built by reacting to things as they happen, because right now guys, more than anything, i'm fucking scared, i'm scared for what they're going to do, because they 100% think that if enough windows get smashed then they can fucking roll tanks in the streets and people. by and large will allow it to happen, and the only way that's not going to happen. the only way that's not going to happen is if we don't let it happen. and of course that doesn't mean anything now and it can't mean anything now because we're not in the situation, we're not responding, but every day the people stay out there, it's another day, the power can be built. I'm not gonna say I think there's going to be enough, I really don't, but that doesn't change the math at all, because winning and being right are or being right in some abstract uh analytical sense mean nothing, acting means something, because only through action can we find purpose. and more importantly, only through action can we find effective uh counteraction, effective attempts to stop them from doing what they want to do, and you're already seeing that, you're already seeing the possibilities that emerge in these situations, and uh, the thing that they need is bodies. the thing they need is people, because at some point if there's enough people, you find out that maybe that negotiating position uh that seemed completely impassible, it's not quite as uh fixed as it seemed, because it all because it depended on an assumed passivity among the population that is that can be disrupted and change change the the the change the power dynamic change the degree of uh of leverage, i mean obviously the next step, the step that would genuinely help prevent the kind of crackdown and reassertion. of like a new order of pure coersive uh uh urban essentially open air surveillance and uh and uh coersion uh would be uh some sort of labor disruption as in obviously strikes but also the disruption of the ability to continue functioning this for the... the economy to function, now of course, it's hard to get any more specific than that, one, because things are still happening, these the these formations are still in the process of being formed, but but you can see them being formed, they fucking took over a a hotel in Minneapolis and they turn it into a homeless shelter, and yes of course with the with with the uh owners allowing them to do it, but that still speaks to a degree of coordination outside of uh official channels that looked impossible just a couple of weeks ago, and that makes you wonder what could be possible a couple weeks from now, but it's hard to say anything more specifically, one, as I said, because it's so fluid, but too, because there's going to be uh, a hell of a comp crackdown coming and the fact that so many people have their entire lives online and have their entire political views online and their entire political actions online is going to be helpful to them in that respect. so i don't advocate anything specific uh because every situation is different every protest is different the... composition of every group of people are in a given situation is different, the response of the police officers is not always identical, the response of bystanders and and uh the unengaged is different. what i do know is that the only way to prevent this from just being another another milestone on the road towards - of uh collapse not of the states uh or the state's ability to to control life uh but rather our ability to live in any way with any dignity with with any control of her own existence. the only way to stop that that from happening is to prevent them from putting a cap on it the way that they want to, and that means first foremost and only right now on at this point uh, being out there if you can and supporting if you can in any way you and in the way that you can, and the internet is good to the degree that it helps you coordinate. actions and tell you where to go and what and what people need, but it sure shit is not going to tell you what's happening, it's not going to tell you who the good guys and the bad guys are, it's not going to tell you the morality of anything, it's not going to tell you uh, what what tactics are going to be the most effective or revolutionary and which ones are actually uh, you know those are really neoliberal, no one knows, so I would say to anyone and this includes me that is scary as it is, it's also very exciting and you know a new world is being born, but just what kind is is, what kind of world it is is one that uh, that nobody knows, and I mean the trajectory has been pretty bad, so it it makes sense to assume it's going to just get worse. but if you don't want it to be, you at least have to know to be able to tell yourself and to tell your loved ones uh that you that you tried and uh some... someone on twitter the other day said uh said how does it fit with the grill pill and it's it really does it really does uh echo the idea that you got to go out, i mean you got to do something near you, and if you're anywhere near a protest, that's a thing near you, that's a fucking thing near you. now the problem is is that this is basically an urban movement as you would imagine and uh because of the way that uh that cities have been racially segregated and and the way capital has been shifted through out urban areas that yeah you have these these uh city centers that are now surrounded by um by reactionary suburbs uh which is a reversion of the dynamic that persisted in say uh France where which is France is essentially the country where the model of the the revolutionary uh spontaneous riot that becomes a a uh that coales into an actual revolutionary movement was essentially born and then the reverse is true there the middle of the city is where all the swells lived and the suburbs where all the workers live the red belts around Paris uh and that's been reversed in the United States but the thing that also has happened is that those same urban because of uh specifically because of gentrification are also the places where all the all of rich people's money is stuck in real estate, so there is still vulnerability there, there still is, there's a lot of money in these cities, there's a lot of uh of investment, and that is a point of leverage. that can be exploited, once again i don't know how, i have no idea, i just know that that they're gonna that that the option of just the option that happened after 1968, which is essentially just a strategic retreat for of of uh state resources and and white populations from cities and then just uh maligne neglect coupled with uh uh massive. you now uh police investment that's harder now uh i mean my god how half of in the Manhanton in the 80s half of half of the buildings in in like south of Houston. were fucking uh uh empty, they were they were squatting squatters warehouses, there's very little actual money on the table in those places, now I mean all those buildings that got smashed up uh in so those things are all filled with empty apartments that all have billions of dollars uh sunk in them from the global elite to to to to park their money so that's a significant difference and that's means that it's going to be much harder. uh for uh for for them to just do a strategic retreat uh which would require a retaking and a re-stablishment of uh law and order, but so far that has not happened, but like yeah like the cops just let all that looting happened yesterday because they want to terrify all the upper west and north side people who run the town. the people really have the money and the people who really uh shot call the shots, not fucking build a blazio, the wall and the wall street people, they want them to sign off, even if they might have urban liberal sensibilities on an un trameled response, but that's only possible if if the people who are uh under that threat. are are a small enough group and if they're if they're alone enough, if they don't have enough support, but yeah i don't know what's going to happen, i just know that everybody's got a responsibility to to to do what they can, because this is what we got, the same way that the burny campaign was was what was happening and was the shot. and was was the process, was the was the movement? uh, this is that, and it might not, it might not be uh organized enough for some, and it it might not have enough concrete goals, and I do think those are things that are wildly necessary, but like I said, uh, they're not going to be built by sculding, that's going to be built by uh, by cooperation and by participation. with enough people, I will say though that um that I am surprised by how uh resistant people are to being cowed by the by the moralizing that usually a company is any kind of property damage uh and that is provoked intentionally. by the police for that reason, because there's less to lose, and because we've seen our institutions completely fail us in every fucking level, so what the hell, a bank an intact bank window uh uh speaks to a a a a sense that you have a, you have a a functioning order right, and that that it's one that you can participate in uh, but if that order does. if that order ceases to hold any real imagina imaginative power of if it seases to stand for anything good, if it ceases to, if it ceases like everything in the country right now, ceases to provide, then what do you give a shit if it gets broken? what do you get a shit? and i think that's what people are kind of realizing is that the horror they might have once had for this stuff is dissolving in the fact in the face of the system's complete calousness and incompetence, the overwhelming callesis and incompetence that speaks that is uh, you is now felt more and more keenly by more people than any time in in my life, that's for sure. Yeah, we're not, and people see that it's the cops really more than anything, because for every video of some smashed windows, there's a video of a cop pointing a fucking bazooka at someone's face or uh, taking someone's eyeball out with a a point blank shot from a a rubber bullet, every... but I don't have a lot of illusions that what's ever going to come out of this is going to be some sort of permanent change i think the best hope is that it builds like I said structures that can move forward from here uh like people love to compare shit to revolutions of the past people love to compare shit to revolutions past uh and in fact you've got entire political tendencies that are essentially revolve around recreating of the 1917 October revolution uh, but I would say that the thing right now that that this historically reminds me the most of is 1905 in Russia, uh, because the Russian Revolution of 1905 caught everyone by surprise, including every... reform movement, every socialist party, every radical, none of them were involved in the leadership of them, none of them had anything to do with the planning, because there basically was no planning, uh, but over time systems emerged, the concept of the Soviet was born in 1905 in St. Peters, and uh, and and that's what this feels like, now that doesn't mean that a 1917 is inevitable, um, but it certainly means that the structures that emerged from 1905 could emerge here, because you had a government in in Zarish Russia that was that lost all legitimacy due to its incompetence, lost its ability to project itself as a provider of security or or safety uh uh bread anything uh got their asses kicked in in Japan uh and and I can't think of a um uh a time that more reflects this current moment just in terms of the the general dawning sense that this government and this system is at base function incapable of doing what it is supposed to do, at least what we all are told it's supposed to do and we all convince ourselves as what is actually supposed to be done, it's supposed to be doing, so i don't have any kind of real hope uh that this is going to be the revolution, whatever that even would mean, but if there is going to be any coherent. an effective uh countermobilization against this slide towards bare face techno authoritarianism, it's gonna come out of this, because you know if you want to compare it to 1905 uh and then assume 197, whatever that moment happens is going to come a lot faster than uh than 15. years later, um, that was also on the knife edge and very well could have led to a complete reactionary uh uh takeover, and so that's still certainly in the cards, but I think this is important, uh, there's nothing about the protest themselves in any sense that is going to make it inevitable. what's going to make it inevitable is the declining rate of profit and the collapse of uh of civic institutions. the sniffing by the way, it's not because i'm on cocaine, i have hallergies, thank you very much, and it's a little damp today, and that tends to make them worse. rag weed, maybe that's what zisic, maybe zisic's allergic too. and as scary as these cops are, i mean they also are just fat suburbanites at the end of the day, i mean there's only so much work they really want to do, i mean they they don't have dreams of of of of continent spanding dominion, they have dreams of uh you know adding another level to their duck deck or something. And that's the thing about. Americans is that you know we don't we're not really built, we're not gritty, we're not, I mean as much as we fetishize that stuff, the reason we do that is because we know we're all soft putting boys and girls, we know that I mean we know we we we buy trucks to drive around with and we never take them even off of a fucking highway, we never take them anywhere other than starbucks, I mean we do that for a reason, we do that to to justify, we these guys stack up these fucking hockey pads and and uh and guns so that they can act and feel like they're tough, but no, but they aren't, and the and what that what what toughness is essentially is a willingness to sacrifice yourself, a lack of concern at the end of the day for your physical wellbeing, your physical harm, and and and your your material surroundings and that does not exist anywhere, uh, that's and the thing that builds that sense is having less to lose, but hopefully um, another thing that can make you believe that uh, is having more to gain, not for yourself though, uh, and I think that's a thing that has Hamstrong politics in this country, as it the world has become desacralized, and as we have become more and more consciously and unconsciously devoted to to uh pleasure as an end to itself, uh, is that you're probably not going to live to see? anything good in this world, none of us, no one listening to this, no one watching this, no matter what happens out there with this protest is likely to see anything like a significant revolutionary change in their lifetime, but that doesn't mean you don't try, because the people who come after you matter just as much as you do, the people and and that... is something that has to be rediscovered, and so the the feeling like you don't have anything to lose might get you out in the street, but I think what's going to get you keep you in the street is the dawning realization that there is something to gain, but if you focus on it for in the here and now, and that's what it seems to me so many people who like say this isn't going to change anything, look at this, the corporations are saying they like it, that is... based on an assumption that whatever you choose to do you have to believe not only is it going to be successful in the short term, it is going to bring about some sort of significant revolutionary change for you, and if that's the standard, nothing will meet it, nothing will meet that standard, because that's not how it works, sometimes it works, sometimes you're there, holy shit, the best steel falls, but you can't assume that anything you do will lead to that. It's like those guys who spent an entire lifetime building a cathedral, but by the time they're dead, all all that's up is like one flying buttress, they still did it, it's it's the medieval cathedal. and you got to think of it that way, we all have to think of ourselves as coming together to build something that's not going to be that we're not going to be able to live in, there are a build like Moses wasn't able to go to the promise land to be able to live in the house of your building and the thing that happens and the thing that will build that is: detaching yourself from pleasure as an end to itself, which was the greatest and most i i guess inevitable byproduct of of of capital hyperation is is that it it it disenchants the world and replaces enchantment with with stuff, and if all we have is stuff then the only thing that matters is stuff, and i'm not talking about you have to live in a fucking. you know in a shed and lying on a bed of rusty nails like chsky is what is to be done protagonist just saying that you cannot operate politically from the assumption that you will live to see the promise land and a lot of people if they the weighing action in the sense of control over their lives versus the danger of doing that that's the deciding. but nothing is probably going to work until all of a sudden oh shit it is and it just the thing that makes a difference is people keeping pushing people not going home people people making a leap of faith like. so as again as has been on here before my advice is log on to the degree that it helps you know how to log off and what to do when you log off but i just i found myself this weekend just getting staring into the goddamn palentier and just and uh and feeling like the the fucking mercury poisoning entering my blood stream the paralysis set in the analysis paralysis of wait a minute what is going on who's who's doing the looting what's going who's who wants this to happen we're the provocators uh and if if you get stuck at that level uh then we all know what's going to happen, but the thing that's going to prevent that is it's a lot easier to make that leap when there's less to comfort you when there's less material stuff to to indulge to imagine and the fact that everybody's been in indoors for three months and so much of their their life that used to give them pleasure and diversion is no longer. there, that's a powerful thing, but yeah, cops are loading up bricks, the cops are smashing things, the cops are allowing looting to happen because they want a blank check, and of course, no matter how much they hem and ha, every fucking scumbag on tv is going to give it to them when a time comes, uh, MSNBC will give it to them, CNN will give it to them. uh all these democratic governors and mayors who are gas to Trump are going to carry it out uh and the only thing is going to stop them is us, so as scary as it seems. and I am I'm genuinely scared of what's coming with the fucking cop with the military mobilization uh fucking drones and uh and I mean I would not be surprised if there was it's not a concerted effort to start uh rounding up ring leaders especially now with Antifa being called a terrorist organization uh but if we lay down for. but then we're going to lay down for everything that comes after it. I mean, yes, so there will be there, there's probably going to be some sort of martial law, honestly, the fact that today is a primary day is very funny. to me and the fact the idea of of any of this uh being uh resolved through elections is very funny so much so that I'm becoming more and more convinced that we might not even have elections in November. And I do like the fact that you're already seeing demands come out of this uh which speaks to the the the the the effect uh the the the the community building effect of this kind of thing because you know uh uh last Thursday it was it was smashy smashy but we're already seeing significant uh formation around the idea of reducing police uh police force size and budgets which is a hugely which would be huge because the reason they do that shit is out for fun or aesthetics and it's not even really because the cops have uh politicians over a barrel it's because that is how you keep these fucking property values so high. It's it's how you maintain order in in these cities that have been slowly and steady stripped of all non uh police social net uh networks and social functions uh and and safety net so saying way fewer cops and hey how about this way fewer guns on cops that is a genuine challenge because to accommodate that you would have to put a shit ton more. into making cities function as social spaces that doesn't involve coersion and incarceration, that doesn't put the problem in jail and provide revenue streams for private prisons and shit, that is not in the cards, as that's not on the on the long-term plans for any of these people. but it is hard to imagine this happening in any other context than a three-month quarantine uh and i mean i talked on here on the other streams about the slow steady dawning realization that all of this quarantening wasn't for anything but a lot of people especially in cities especially good liberal people in cities who believe in science and have this sense of a public good uh that involves not getting old people sick with a potential virus, they stayed home, even though nothing was being done to make that quarantine me anything. this gave people the excuse that they needed to go outside. this is this was a thing that superseeded the virtue inherent in staying indoors. this was finally a way to get outside without feeling guilty about it. and that you can look at that cynically, or you can say now they're in the streets. and now they can make a new choice. what's the what's the moral thing now? what, what is the community minded thing now? that the cops are out there cracking skulls and shooting people uh with bean bags and teergas? but yeah uh I mean if you want to keep on that 197 1905 shit uh I guess Biden would be like the Stilepin like the the the the moderate PM who comes in and oversees you know a bunch of uh executions and imprisonments but but also acknowledges the importance of... transition to democratic institutions and all that stuff. uh, I will be - going out to approach. just as soon as this uh, i was out last night, i've been out, i'm not going to talk about what i'm doing for a number of reasons, i'm in New York City for one of them, and these cops are legitimately psychopaths, um, and i'm not going to be posting about it, i'm sorry, i'm not going to be validating anyone else's opinion of me by by uh, by trying to prove that i'm a good person, uh, but i will be going to a protest after this, but beyond that. I'm not going to be broadcasting anything, so if you want to audit my uh, my behavior for virtue, that's up to you, I'm not going to provide you, I'm not going to play along with that. I'm probably, I will, I will relevel with people in that I'm probably not going to uh pick too many fights with cops because I am disabled as it were, but we'll see what happens. I will say though that uh Joe Biden telling the cops to shoot people in the leg is perfect liberalism uh and more proof that we have reached the the end point of both political parties. Trump and Biden represent the terminal, the terminal decrepitude of the two major parties uh, and they're they're in their own way. their own different ways uh that are determined by their different social bases, they are revealing their utter impedence in the face of uh of processes that are completely beyond the control of any political um faction or or even the political class at this point. I think police unions, the deal with police unions is, I think you limit what they can like organize around, you know uh, like the two big things the police unions love to organize around are preventing oversight and resisting a... residency requirements, two things that make it much easier to have a police force of suburban maniacs who kill with impunity: union should be able to do something like that. Oh, someone points out, there's actually one more perfectly emblematic liberal uh response to this, even more perfect than Biden saying shoot people on the leg, and that is the fact that former president Barack Obama wrote a medium post, the format of people apologizing for getting me tooed, has now been used by Barack Obama uh, to tell people. to chill out, amazing, impodence, reveling in impodence, i mean, trump, trump is impodent, look at they had to shoot, they had to fire a bunch of paintball at some fucking anglican uh clergy members so that they could have them wave the bible in front of a fucking church uh the as David roth point out that leaked audio of him talking to the governors he sounded like a pissed off guy calling in the Mike Francisco show about the giant's offensive line he's just a spectator. like that's why fixating on Trump as always is a chimera and a fail it's a failure of analysis because he is as much uh in the sea as a rest of these people like their response to corona was determined by the nature of the American economy it was not determined by any ideology and the response to this as you see unified police uh unified forces democratic governors, republican governors, democratic govern, mayors almost all across determined by the need to reasert power and authority in these cities, uh, none of that is determined at the political level. but if you're sitting on if you're sitting sidelines for this and you're waiting for something better i guess i think that's what people are saying you know like a lot of the people who uh were pooed the the sanders campaign and are now in the streets uh they were waiting for something better and a lot of the people who who like Bernie and now are skeptical of of of the protests they're also waiting for something better and and in both cases the answer is this is what we have, this is what's happening, this is the movement, this is where things are fluid, this is where opposition is and and organism. is being mounted, and so if you want things to change, if you want to assert any control over the world, then you must do it through what is in front of you, if you wait for the perfect, perfectly class-based political movement to appear, that's that will never happen, and all you will have to keep yourself comfortable as things get worse and worse and worse is your own sense that you're smarter than everybody else. and that's cold fucking comfort, let me tell you, but the thing that's really most striking is the absolute collapse in institutional legitimacy. we've talked about that and we've talked about how Trump is the symptom of it and all that, but this is the most stunning example of it is the... fact that the the playbook of everyone getting horrified at uh at some looting and then deciding to condemn it uh didn't happen this time because more and more people have lost all investment in any of these institutions political or otherwise and that's the first and most necessary step for anything to get better because if if you are invested in these institutions they will at the end of the day uh determine your behavior. Now the scary thing is is that the only institution in American life that has not lost all of its uh legitimacy is the military yeah ooh and that is why the other person you got to look out for if we're talking uh early 20th century Russia compares of course this is all fast and meetingless, this is a completely different situation, but if you want to have fun with it, if you're looking for who's trotski, you're looking for who's Lenin emerging out of this 1905 moment uh, and you know, and moving into the future, you got to wonder who's uh, who's Kornelov? Who's denican? Who's Kulcheck? Because the military is the only institution with any kind of bipartisan uh legitimacy in this country, because so many people's family members. are part of it, and because it has been able to maintain a non-political stance relative to the political process, uh, and almost no other institution has been able to do that, everything else has been politicized, and of course, obviously the military is political, but it is not perceived by enough, very many people, relative to other institutions as political, and that is why if things get worse and if this becomes a prolonged struggle uh and that prolonged struggle is happening in the context of a prolonge economic crisis oh and by the way a continued pandemic that will continue to kill people at at now probably much higher ratess and the military might be the only thing uh that can unify people or at least enough people to reestablish even a baseline legitimacy for order. and that's a scary thought, every thought is scary right now, but none of that obviates or anyone's moral, strategic imperative to grab with both hands the world in front of them and try to shape it for the better. I hope everybody stays safe, I hope everybody finds something that they could do that can make them feel like they're contributing, and I hope that fear over time will turn into something else, maybe maybe hope, we'll see. All right guys, uh, going to be going, see on the flippy flop, I think I'll be doing more of these in the future, I think uh, might be going back to daily daily streams, but we'll see, maybe not, no promises. Bye-bye.
