 I want to stand up, you know, you know, no, you don't, you don't, I want to sign on to the hearts of man, I want to reach out with the back of my broken head, another head, a heartbreak, I'm so much older than I can. Okay, reflection, well it comes and goes on the direction to perfection, no, no, no, no, help me out, yeah, you know, you got to help me out, yeah, don't you put me on the back burner, you know, you got to help me out, when there's nowhere else to run. there's a room for one more song, this changes ain't changing me, the cold hearted boy i used to be, hi guys, i'm not soul, i've got soul, but damn it, i'm not a soldier, uh, full disclosure, uh, i've done a lot of content production today, so kind of a mul tap, I probably wouldn't have done a stream today if I hadn't missed Monday and Tuesday, I try to do like three a week if I'm not letting people know ahead of time I'm not going to be doing them so I felt like I didn't want to skip again but I'm I don't really know what to say so I might have this is going to be a loose one this is going to be uh another low key uh vibe stream so so fair warning ahead of time on that, don't expect a lot of verbal fireworks here, i'm just trying to kind of cool down, it's sure a shit beats working though, i'll say that, there's no question about it, i saw the Bob Odenkirk trailer and i had heard of this movie before, i i've heard like for a year now that this movie was being made buse, i remember reading a thing where bob oncur was talking about how he was getting trained by the john wick. guys and i thought it was really exciting and i saw the trailer and it's just john wick, it's what if basically it's what if John wick's wife hadn't died a year after they got married, what if she'd lived and they'd had kids and then like after he got kind of old uh he had to come back like that's the only difference like everything else beat for beat and style and aesthetics looks basically the same and that was disappointing. still see it, I love Bob Ork, obviously have loved him since fuck Mr. Show, since the ben Stiller show, which I am old enough to remember and do have loved watching as a kid for the one glory season that it ran. man, early 90s fox was the best, I would say that early 90s Sunday night on Fox is the best network television has been for comedy, because you had anchoring you hadn't married with. children and then you had uh simpson's there for sometimes it switched to Thursday but it's it was with Sunday it was started on Sundays uh but then you had shit that didn't do nearly as well didn't last as long as those shows but in my opinion I mean obviously you know you're a kid things are funnier uh but in my opinion hold up and help shape my comet perspective in a lot of ways get a life with Chris Elliot fantastic show uh Ben Stiller show which I don't think holds up as well just because so much of it is based on direct parodies of stuff that was happening at the time like specific TV shows and specific commercials that's not going to land the same way but still you can't beat that cast you can't beat uh who ended up being on that show I mean that's where fucking Bob and David met literally and then helped make Mr. Show the greatest American sketch comedy show of all time and in the running for it's like it's in the top conversation top. two or three ever, i mean i don't know if it's not Mr. show monty python and kids in the hall, i who's what's a fourth competitor there? uh, and what else? oh, they also had the oh, they had crazy high concept shit that might not be funny, you might not look back on, i think it was funny, but compared to the other shows on tv, it was interesting and and different like Herman's head, which was ripped off for uh inside out, any, i don't know if anybody else saw inside out and was outraged at how horrifyingly they had ripped off the show herman's head, which was a show that it was a sitcom and the premise was there's a guy herman and he's trying to make it in the big city and publishing, but you cut back to him in his head uh uh between his like parts of his consciousness and and it was uh the horny fat guy who was his lust, there was the nerd and glasses who was his intellect, there was the twwerpy nervous guy was anxiety and then the hippy lady who was uh his uh emo emotions and like sensitivity, then there is a show called whoops, which i was describing someone this show last weekend and they couldn't believe this was a real show, it was essentially Gilligans island, but the gimmic was instead of them being on a desert island, they were the last people to survive an accidental nuclear holocaust, and they all lived in a house together in a blasted wasteland, and this was a multicamera sitcom with a laughtrack, and there was one episode i saw as a little kid i still remember uh where uh Santa Claus shows up and he's got survivors guilt because uh the elves the reindeer and Mrs. Claus were all killed in the nuclear blast. I'm seeing uh for other best uh sketch comedy show chapel show chapel show is definitely in the running at sure i think it could probably take out honestly replace Monny Python with the chapel show at this point comedy has. has a shelf life, money python shelf life is over, the chapel still is still funny, so throw that out there, chapel show, uh, or maybe yeah, chapel show, mr. show, kids in the hall, i think you should leave, might be in the discussion, but you need a lot more episodes, there's literally six 20 minute episodes, that's not enough, audio is low, oh fuck me, what do you want me to do, what do you want me to do? i've got the thing turned up. uh, I don't know what to do, you want me to put it farther up here, state was okay, state's not as good as ben stiller show, mad tv is pretty good, and mat TV when you look back on it is it was definitely uh, it was willing to go places that you can't go anymore, so it has that kind of uh going for it just as a curio, but sketch by sketch. there's a lot of dog shit on mad tv, come on, kean peel, i would say is probably better than the chapel show as a like on a sketch by sketch basis, because and the premises are very crisp, but it's also a little airless, it's a little overintellectualized in a way that the chapel show isn't and that makes the chapel show more visserally connected. but anyway this is all away saying I love bad Bob Otenkirk like nobody's business but watching that trailer and just seeing him just do the Kiano thing with the same guns and the same choreography and the same even the same uh sheen and the same lighting schemes and at one point at the thing where he gets the guns out that have been kept in the in the bunker and he's got a bunch of gold bars those are just like the coins from it's like god once they figured out that they could replace squibs. with choreography and and then made uh John Wick the exemplar of that, they just decided like with all things they were just going to monopolize the entire action space and they're going to turn everything into fucking john wick, so a little disappointed in the trailer, but I will certainly see it, although when I saw at the end of the tr it says only in theaters, February 26th, I'm like, okay guys, good luck with that. you guys in tenent can sit together and talk about how that goes, kids in the hall, i didn't say uh, somebody says kids in the hall is better than uh better than chappelle, i didn't say i hell shiel in the top three, you kick out monny python, you don't kick out kids in the hall, kids in the hall, one of the things that's most impressive about kids in the hall is that i would say unlike any other show i can imagine, any other sketch. i can think up, you can watch an episode from the kids in the hall and you can guess who wrote each sketch and you will probably be right, if you watch the whole show and you like get the comedic sensibilities of the different different uh performers and and and writers you see who like oh this is this is a this is a uh kevin and dave sketch oh this is one of those uh uh you know one man show scott thompson things this is the weird sweaty experimental film that's Bruce Baller. but that's very cool to me, money has that too, but as I said Monty Python is just, it's streets behind is peer thoras. would say, it's streets behind, have I heard of Saturday night live, pretty funny, I mean, yeah, it is, come on, I thought Kevin and uh, I thought, I always thought that Kevin and Dave collaborated on all those old timey like kind of avad and Costello premise sketches. like the one where it's Bob and Dave and they're like in a diner or something, like the citizen Kane sketch, which is a great sketch, citizen Kane, it was citizen Kane, it was citizen Kane, you need a mortition, sudden eruptions of bloody violence is one of the best ways to get my commit go, I will admit. Uh, Tim and Eric is fantastic, but when I think of sketch shows, I sort of like when I try to think of like the arc type and and pinnacle sketch shows, I think of ones that conform to the sketch concept, you know, like I honestly feel like Tim and Erica is almost a liminal thing, it's not even really a sketch show, like those are not really sketches. in the traditional sense, they do not have premises that play out in the way that sketches traditionally do, but it's fantastic, you i mean also formatively influential. 30 uh, somebody says when did SNL knows dive, SNL never knows dove anywhere, this is one thing that I will will will uh submit, it is as bad as it's ever bad, I will, I will stipulate, I just watched the Kevin B uh Kevin Baven, the the... Jason Baitman episode from Saturday, I just watched that on uh Monday and might be the worst one I've ever watched, but that's not because of some sudden collapse of quality. SNL because it's been on the air non-stop for fucking 40 years, has the same antropic principle embedded within this that everything does, it's the same reason that Simpsons is terrible, because it's still on. so the the the quality degradation of SNL is not some drop, it is a steady decline with you, within it, it's it's a trend downward that within it contains highs and lows, both within episode, both within sketches within episodes, episodes within seasons, seasons within tranches of seasons, but the trend line is down, and that's that's anything over time will it show that trait because the energy it's it beginning is being dissipated and now in a specific context of a program like a tv show like the sims or snl that that big bang is like the premise you know the container the creative container for the energies of the people making it and that container has limitations and over time you hit the limits of them, and the way you avoid the show becoming bad is you stop making it, and when you don't stop making it, horrifying things happen, and you see this like new Simpsons is an abomination, and in fact at this point, you wanted to get logicy on it, I think you could make a strong argument that the Simpsons is unbalance a bad show, because it has been. actively bad for twice as long as it was good, and that means it's just sheer, sheer volume of output, if you're gonna keep it as one thing, if you're gonna say this is one show, and you can't really say it isn't, because that's how all shows work, there's a name of a show, a premise of the show, it lasts and then it's gone, this you can say uh, ch, but like, nothing really changed, you know, it wasn't one thing, it wasn't one guy leaving, it wasn't ship of theseus, uh, it's a ship of theseus. Schwarzwelder was writing on like the 20th season or something like the people who made it great were there, there are still guys who write for it now who wrote for it originally like uh what's the guy we had on the show me and Virgil interviewed uh um uh he's he's been on since the beginning Graining's still there I I've been to a simpson's table read we got invited to Mike Reese is his name Mike Reese invited us to a simpson's table Reed and I got to see them do it and it was a fucking amazing and but the thing is, but and they were all there, fucking graining was uh, graning wasn't there, but James L Brooks was there, so there is a continuity, you can't say it's not the same product. what happened? time passed. the thing that killed the simpsons was not ean maxstone gram or merken or any whoever people blame for for or graining for selling out, it was only for allowing it to continue. so if you if you compose the idea that the simpsons, the simpsons is a program, right? the simpsons is a TV. program, we're not going to talk about what dividing within it, it is a holistic thing, a television series that's been on for almost 40 years now, and it has a number of episodes within it to have different quality, if you look at it from remove and say, is this a good or a bad show, there is an argument to be made that semantically, like in the narrowest sense, it is a bad show, because i subscribe very much to the notion that binaries are composed of infinite gradients, but for the purposes of denotation, uh, once a certain inflection point of attributes has been reached, the thing gains a characteristic that can use be used to describe it by other people, like that's how we get to language, is the accumulation of traits, you reach, you have like say x number, there's x- number of traits, once you reach y, you enough of them have been uh obtained that this counts as thing we can say, so it's a show, is it good? no, it's a bad show, it's a bad show, put on the simpson's random episode, it's probably going to be bad, and that's purely because they left it on, which is why getting mad at SNL for anything, for the simpsons, for anything other than refusing to stop, uh, is wrong, but the thing is, when you do that, you're not getting mad at the simpsons creators, you're not getting mad at even Loren Michaels, you are getting mad at capitalism, once again and for always, you are getting mad, because the profit engine of the entertainment industry has dictated that these things should continue to go on. Our favorite shows that were great a lot of times we we were protected from them being remembered as bad because they weren't profitable to make anymore, and they stopped making them before they got bad. That's like the capitalist regulator that that can protect our good shows from turning into bad shows, because that's the only real gatekeeper that we have in mass culture is is profitability, so capitalism killed the Simpsons and killed SNL, although with SNL I would argue that it started at a much lower quality, the early SNL is not that great, if you put on an average 1977 episode even given the fact that... Comedy taste change over time, there's like maybe a couple of good sketches there, it's just now there's no good sketches, not and I would say that until recently you could usually bank maybe one decent sketch an episode, and I think that only in the last couple seasons is that no longer the case, yep, put more names in the black book of capitalism. The main thing I resist in SNL this course is try to to um is is trying to validate any previous generation of SNL compared to the current one, it's just entropy that distinguishes them, and the reason for that is I remember most of these things, like in some way I've watched a lot of this shit and and this the real, the stuff that sticks is very rare, but one thing I know for sure is the close the stuff you see when you're younger is going to stick more and that means you will never be able to judge it accurately, you'll never come close to being able to evaluate it, because the stuff you remember liking, you have forgotten all the garbage, all the garbage just ran through your head, unless it was so bad, it was memorable, it just ran through the fucking uh sewer grapes into the into the sewer and then floated away into your subconscious, what got stuck, in the pan in the gold pan is stuff that you remember and remember enjoying and remember to enjoying with the with the simple-minded uh easy enthrollment of youth, which adds all sort of color and emotion to your memories, but they're all positive. no modern thing will compare to that, but the thing is with most stuff you're not comparing one to one, whereas with Saturnight live sketches you are comparing the same thing, and that means it will never ever ever live up, and so no one can truly judge SNL, sketch content. when they were younger. I will say though that one of those things that's driving it bad. as politics gets more, as culture gets more political, it's very bad for a show like that, because topical political comedy is maybe the lowest form of comedy, currently uh popular, and that's not neces, and that's and that's only because of how ubiquitous politics is, and i mean. there's a reason that we help create a genre of political comedy with chapo because you know we're funny, but I don't know if any of us would have made it through the gatekeepers of comedy to be able to be professionally humorous, what kind of gave us an entry point was that we had a relatable subject that people cared about and that we could triangulate our humor off of, and that that would give us a hearing with people that we wouldn't get if we were just trying to hit people at a purely comedic register, so we were essentially cheating, we were stretching out the meatloaf, i'll admit, but the thing is like now people want that so you know they were going to want it either way i'd rather they get it for me i think what you can really pull from snl is just the like like a baseball team and being a fan of snl i've said before it's much more like being a fan of a baseball team than of a television show you you don't it doesn't matter if it's good or bad you know it's your team and you watch it and you take a you keep your eyes open for talent and you you know see it develop or whatever or fail to develop? so the thing to remember is like uh performers like who who has stood out you know who are uh and what are the one of the real uh signals of the current degradation is how thin the benches talent-wise right now snl was never was never was not always this political you'd have a you'd have a cold you'd have a political cold open like. I don't now every every cold open is political and I don't think that used to be the case, but then again i don't really, I wouldn't never remember a lot of them cuz cold opens usually aren't very good, smoking like a true brewers fan, indeed, oh boy, I didn't want him to win the covid, covid championship anyway. there are were some great old uh uh political sketches though and there was some kind of uh subversive stuff there was a sketch on uh there was a classic partman Ronald Reagan sketch at the during the height of iron contra where the joke was is that he was pretending to be this godtering old man but behind closed doors he was like the mastermind of a globe spanning uh money and gun laundering operation and that's the kind of like coming at it from an angle thing that they've never been able to figure out in my in my like in my era in my like more recent memory of the show they they very much get stuck on like a a play on the guy and then they just run with it and that means it's essentially the same sketch every week. I'd say hartman was definitely like maybe the greatest Saturnight live cast member of all time in terms of all-around talent and and crucialness to the show success. One thing I will note that I said this before they did it on last on Saturday show is that they do they do recurring sketches not recurring characters the characters are unmemorable it's the premise with a different skeleton of jokes and that's what that's how you use a recurring character it's the a recurring character is a premise essentially and a skeleton to you for to put more specific jokes on now they just have the premise without the character. they have not bothered to create characters people like because they know they can't, they know they can't get something over in the wrestling sense the way that you could with like uh the richmister or Wayne and Garth or uh or even like one of those christian one of those 15 awful christine christine Wigg uh recurring characters none of them can get over a recurring character so it's just the sketch over and over again it's amazing. So the green is people. no celebrity jeparty does not have charac. first of all celebrity jeparty is like 10 years old now and i'm talking about current snl so that's he not even relevant but secondly trebec isn't really a character in that sketch he's basically a straight man and impressions don't really count anyway and it's not a very good impression will ferrol is definitely uh one of the like top five too. Faral was pharel held the same role of like uh glue that Hartmann did and he was less of an impressionist and more of a more of a wild man but uh it's very similar very similar position cometic point guard i guess or no i don't know i don't know enough about basketball. It is amazing to me the Keen and Thompson is still there, I believe he's been there for uh 16, 17 seasons, I think this might be a 17 seasons, that's got to be, that's got to be a record right, like Tim Meadows didn't stay that long. and I kind of respect it because I'm assuming what's happening there is that he has just like made the zen decision that okay like this is my job I'm not going to be famous I'm not going to be a big star I'm not going to have my own franchise this is my job like somebody works in an office somebody uh digs ditches I do these sketches I'm I like doing it I have fun better than real work I'll just keep doing it and I respect that. for Tim Meadows, he was there forever, but it was because he couldn't get a character, and he needed to get a character for him to do what they all did in the 90s at the height of the like after Wayne's world when like every every uh uh, every recurring character was a potential movie, and that meant a potential movie career, and when you saw what like Mike Meyers went, it was like, holy fuck, farly, even Dana Carvy before master of disguise, that was what? they were all angling for and like the last one to get it was probably Will Farall, maybe Andy Samberg, but he was never really an S&L cast member, I guess I don't, it's weird because he was doing lonely island the same thing and they're all lonely island movies and it's it's not quite as one to one as like I was uh superstar in uh the girl Mary Catherine Gallager and now there's a movie about that, but he he finally got the ladies man which had some pop and which people liked, even though I never thought Leon Fells was that funny. and so oh god and he goes and he makes the movie and they like mcgrober but that was a failure um and they go okay what is this fails and then he's got to hang around hollywood i mean he's making he probably makes a living but it's certainly less uh stable than coming in putching the clock whereas keen he knows there's nothing out there he's had projects they failed i think he had a sitcom that like didn't go past the pilot or were like first couple episodes and so it's like here there be there dragons i'm going to chill here and as long as he's not tormented by that and doesn't think of it as a failure of some kind as long as he's a peace with it then he is he's the most successful S&L cast member ever bridesmades doesn't count because it's not based on a recurring character that's just somebody doing movies after they were on SNL she had a it's very interesting had a million recurring character, she was the last person to have like a real stable of recurring characters in the 90s tradition uh in - of of SNL and when even though she did become a a movie star in some way, they never made a goddamn one of them into a movie, that's how bad they all were. it was amazing how how she was just being put on everybody, and i think like they must have killed in studio, because the thing is it doesn't matter what they put on, it's it's there, people are going to watch it, that's the secret of all of this, that's the thing that that uh that lawren knows, that's the thing that has turned him into a a demon, is he knows, oh it they watch it, whatever it is, even if it's bad, they'll watch it to talk about how bad it is, the fact that it's on is why people watch it, it has reached that level, so they they just took the fact that like it healed in the studio to mean oh everyone loves Gilly and everyone loves the nervous target uh uh cashier and yet nobody even thought. of putting those in onto a movie screen, they had to do other shit because it was like this stuff is poison and i'd say that's it, that's been the last one and the fact that like mcgrober i think is the last direct. transition and it failed, I don't think it's ever happening again, Ted Lasso just happened, was Ted Lasso an SNL fucking character, was Ted Lasso a Jason Stake's character on SNL, by the way, he's been off SNL for years now, I mean just basic basic stuff, I don't get you people. how unless you're not unless you're not trying to disagree with me but it's a weird way to put it i guess it's uh David s pumpkins was insanely forced oh guys okay this is going to just be the snl sketch one but uh this is just going to be the snl uh stream but that's fine it was bound to happen eventually I'm having fun uh, this is a nice wind down from talking about political bullshit all day, um, so the David Spumpkin Sketch was actually one of those recurring premises I talked about, so like a year before that episode, Larry David hosted, and there was a sketch where it was a bunch of FBI recruits at Hogan's alley doing the uh the target shooting where you have to distinguish between uh threats and uh and uh civilians and they're like dummies that like come up with a gun and like they're animatronics basically and some of them are uh some of them are criminals to be shot and other ones are civilians not to be shot and they pop up a few and they're normal and then one of them pops up and it's Larry David in a uh bright orange suit holding a big brick style 80s um cell phone wearing sunglasses and he goes hey oh fuck what was his name god damn it what was the character's name shit this is literally going to kill me marry david Brian uh Kevin Roberts that was it he goes hey I'm Kevin Roberts and I'm the biggest bitch I'm the smoothest bitch in town and then the guy shoots him and the the trainer goes where I was at and he goes I was confused and it's basically the David S Pumpkins thing of you're expecting one. thing then it's this weird off uh like off premise thing like oh at pumpkins isn't really funny this guy's not really either a threat but he's also a weird what and then the person kind of like f not figuring it out uh and um and that's it that is the sketch and then David pumpkins is the exact same sketch is just during Halloween and it's popping out of the halloween things instead of popping up from the... uh target range, the only big difference is one, you know, Tom Hanks, he's a legendary SNL host uh, and it was uh, and he's always going to be memorable a little bit when he's on the show, like his black jeperdy sketch was one of the few that kind of had legs uh outside of the the you know people sought in the immediate aftermath of its uh airing, but uh, but then also the fact that it was a Halloween episode, and and holiday episodes usually have a little more cultural residence. because it's one of those things that reminds us of the season and then we talk about it to reaffirm that memory um and then three because it actually had a punch line which is very rare for any SNL sketch SNL sketches almost never have punch lines now they just set up the premise do jokes about the premise and then just stop that's that's been the the model for snl sketches for a very long time i mean it's they've never been good at ending sketches it's just not a part of the process of writing a sketch in six. days like that's the hard part and you don't have time, so it makes sense that they just give up, but this one actually had a a punch line, it was when they cut back to the couple after they don't see David Pumpkins with the dancing skeletons, he pops his head up and goes, any questions and they go, ah, that's aha, that's actually like Kevin Roberts doesn't do anything, he they just do it, do it, do it and then quit, and for that reason Davidins popped and became a meme, but it was literally. some fucking stepped on repremised garbage, like these guys are literally just stepping on their own product in order to make the the runtime, but i mean the main problem with SNL at this point is the fact. that's written by the same college educated um soy creatures that every show is written by, like every show is the same voice, it is the voice of twitter, every show every... every every topical program and increasingly even scripted like long stuff like for example the boys is just the voice of twitter one way or the other and that is very enervating and it's hard to enjoy anything like that and yeah like there's a factory that produces these people like they all go to college like they all they all go from their middle class homes to a nice college experience or their upper class homes to a nice college experience where they learn how to express themselves and and and uh work together and not get me tooed, then they go to UCB, used to be - second city, now it's UCB, and then they get caught and then they either write or they perform or some combination and they're all just regurgitating the same fucking cud that they've been chewing on since they uh grew up in like Fuckberg uh suburbs and then went to Sarah Lawrence or whatever the fuck, I mean they're the same people, like this is a big country, a lot of different experiences. and these people are reproducing a comedic reply to almost the exact same experiences of living uh a relatively unprecarious urban educated existence uh that is mediated through that is heavily mediated and that is deeply uh invested in a um in a performative political self-conception you which I mean liberalism which I mean broadly the democrat brain. and because of that nothing can be good, nothing can be good, you got that's why people got to go to stuff that's not going through these uh gatekeers to even come close to anything good uh and i got to say that i never really got nathan for you but having watched um how to by John Wilson? which apparently was is on TV because Nathan Fielder discovered it, I'm I'm going to have to go back and watch that show now, because uh, talking about how everything is bad and comes with the same voice, uh, um, that show, uh, how to with John Wilson is, and the thing is, and this is where, this is where singularity of vision comes in, you could... very easily say to me, well John Wilson is obviously one of the people you're talking about, yes, he is, he is absolutely some middle class person, probably who went to college and then got a professional job in the city, yes, and and and shares like a the same like sort of mediated version of reality that we all do, like the self-created bubble of entertainment, but he's one guy, or like a few people who are like helping him, generating a a relatively coherent, personalized commit. vision, what all these other shows are is a bunch of people who might have that in them, but by the fact that they're all having to work together on the same thing with the same parameters around it, are not going to do anything other than redown to the lowest common denominator between them, which will be the most bland and tasteless and insipid version of that experience that they're all sharing, whereas this is somebody who's having the same experience, but is able to express it, and the only reason i even found out about it is because Nathan Fielder, another guy who that is uh, true of found it, Joe Per is the guy like that too, like none of these people don't fit the demographic profile of who I'm talking about, but they what different is is that they are able to articulate a personalized artistic comedic response. um oh man righteous gemstones is so good that's another small group of people, i mean conor mali of course is another absolute king in that regard, of course i'm saying a bunch of white guys because uh that's who i see online because i'm a white guy, there are others. I have not seen them, I'm not denying their existence. The thing they will share, I will stipulate is a is a relatively coort, coherent and relatively personalized artistic comedic vision. Eric Andre is is a good example. Is the demiers to the gnostics what capital is to the proletarian? yes, that's an perfectly encapsulated way to put it, thank you. then i urge in the practical sense is capitalism, we don't live in the world, we live in a simulated, reduced, bound version of the world, that is that's physical manifestation is generated by a spirit, a geist, a principle that drives everything, that drives the uh the maintenance and the intensification of of uh human. um of human transformation of the environment, what's the code running are ever expanding reordering of the material world around us, what is the thing driving us to build this world instead of the boundless world that it could be, capitalism, but its structures are so real that they are as real to us as our bodies and as much of a of a a um pris as the material world is to the gnostic, as as far removed from the real world, the real pandora around us, as as eternal union with God in heaven is to the nostic who lives in the material world. someone put it very well just now in the comments. Right now, what capitalism is about is uh exploiting uh the resources of the world, using technology to produce capital, to produce surplus, surplus beyond the sustenance of the human race, which of course is then to be held by the the holders of the capital that built it, the the owners, under communism, what we're extracting and trying to pile up and distribute is time, it's free time, free time that is not in pain, like because as I say, there is unalienated labor, but even unalienated labor sucks, like even even though uh cleaning your toilet is less alienating than being a janitor, it still sucks to clean a toilet, so that part that like unpleasantness associated with being alive on earth, that's going to be there, that's that that's part of work that is almost until you've until you have technologically removed the need for it, it's still there, but the less the the the point of like a human species working towards its own like greater betterment would be if we acknowledge that the goal of all this technological progress that we have, the goal of all this economic activity that we're doing that we're friensedly doing, all of these scaffolds we're building, shout out John Wilson, should not be to build up fucking surplus to be held by people. to by virtue of a sucking literal magic trick, claim ownership to it, it would be to free people from unpleasant labor for the longest amount of time, so that they could do things with that material world around them, with that technological understanding, with their understanding of other people, to build something and turn work, turn the time that isn't alienated in work into art, into play, both, like living under communism, living in an unalienated, technologically advanced society. uh work has been replaced by art, like art can be unpleasant too, like art has physical exertion and and gunky parts, but art transcends chores, right? transcends work, it actually takes the things that's gross, and turns those gross things into more adherence to the task, more adherence to the moment, and eventually you get to a point where where labor has been replaced by people literally spending their time on earth creating art and until that point playing when that before you're able to transition the actual like working up the gears of social existence like the actual growing of food and distribution of resources and maintenance of of social order through uh through coordination and and uh uh you know infrastructure, once that's taken care of, everything else is play, but then when you can turn the process of doing that that of extracting, of giving people food, of giving power, of allowing for transfer movement of people over time and place, over over technological innovation, then you have turned it into art, you've turned, you turned work into art, that's the, that's the, that's the alchemy that we're seeking, we are essentially alchimists, and that is the magical, that's the magical formula. that we're looking for, is one that turns work into play, I feel like I on a personal level have done that, I have performed the magic trick on myself, I have, I have, I have casted the spell and drank the potion, but now having done that, the only the only place my animal spirits can truly be satisfied is in the process of casting that spell on others, casting that spell across the world, as far as my my powers can go, and they're not very far, i will have to join my magic with others, i will have to join my my my uh my wand, i'll have to space stock with others, i have to say i definitely feel like i understand allan what allen Moore was talking about in that. episode a lot more than i used to, and i used to thought i kind of got it, somebody says fictional character uh, you know what, this is okay, fictional character the best uh reflects obama, i would say the imagined view of a prestige television show, which is a fictional character, a character created by fiction, created by imagination, hear me out here, you've got prestige shows right, prestige shows because the're television shows, these are pure works of art, as much as we love to talk about guys like David Chase and and Matthew Weiner as as autours, it is a very collaborative process that is deeply emeshed in the capitalist matrix of profitability related to it out. how many episodes of a show you get depends on people watching it, it depends on selling underwear and and uh light beer, think about that, a movie is a movie, here it is, take it or leave it, a show isn't a show really until it's over, and how long it lasts, how much time you get to tell a story, how you get to tell it is determined by how many people watch, which is not determined by quality. as we all know, quality is merely a part of it, what it mostly is is is a uh is an ability to hit people at a common denominator where enough of them are entertained that they want to keep watching, and with a prestige audience, what you do to find that out is you read the fucking recaps, because the recaps before twitter, the recaps were how the internet like the hive mind of the internet that like collective college educated urban liberal. how they responded to stimuli and how they expressed themselves in the social media matrix like barfing up now that we have the internet to literally embody and reflect the mind of our like creative class, we had the technology to hear the echo of the audience at a moment by moment massis, we don't have to rely on fucking Neilson ratings, we don't have to wonder about whether or not people are filling our name out in the book that they keep for like a $5 a month styping from the Neilson company, we get it in real time, the echo local of people responding and the com the uh the recaps and comment sections in the early uh internet websites, i would argue are where people went to find out what these people wanted, and then they made these shows, mad man uh, the sopranos, the sopranos really made it first of all, but remember the sopranos could have been after could have gone off the air after one season. the the sopranos were tacking off of the the media response of them almost immediately because it became this huge phenomenon almost overnight so they were never not captured like beyond the first season everything that came later is fully emeshed in this so even the sopranos count sopranos braking bad uh the person viewing it that they divine through the response first in the form of those recaps and the comments on recaps and then the twitter conversation once twitter enters into it the viewer of that is a highly successful because remember we're after rich college-educated urban liberals, we're not after the ones who are paying back a million gillion student loans and running around gig gig economy jobs, we want the ones with time and money to spend on the kind of products that we advertise, more importantly are willing to spend more for things like a streaming service or a cable channel then you can buse the more of them we get the fewer of the everyone else we need, so we want them as rich as they come who are still going to be sitting. are on watching television, so then we're we're talking about people who by definition, almost are professional class people, people who work at 9 to five and come home and want to sit down and kind of vape out and because they're not able to just be around the world like a very, very rich person, and also there aren't that many of those people, so you're talking about upper middle class professionals of the urban millieu, and what do they create? they created psychopaths, they created Tony Saprano, they created uh walter white, don draper, they created psychopaths, empty vessels of pure self-seek, self-interest, because that is who they saw in the mirror. That's wh they saw in the reflected response to this show, to the shows, because while the people writing about it aren't the most professionally successful ones, they wouldn't be writing recaps if they were and they wouldn't be typing responses to recaps if they were, the the people greenlighting stuff and making art in television can see pass them to the richest versions of them. so I would say the the imagined the people who the guys who created and wrote and and and directed the the creative direct the creative shape of those early prestige TV shows the people they had in mind subconsciously is Barack Obama. It's Barzak Okrumbo, he is the he is the prestige television watcher in chief, and didn't it work, Barack Obama watched the show and said, I really like that batman, uh, take a chase uh, show uh, the wire, it's uh, really good, it, it guaranteed in audience, it guaranteed money in the bank, so they essentially conjured into being. the guy that they had in mind, like prestige television was essentially a giant black mass to summon this beelzab into existence to rule over us, more like barfsackcombo, that's what I said. Yeah, Trump was summoned by television as well, someone Trump was selved, Trump was in a mirror process, Trump was summoned by those people left to fend for themselves in network television after cable came along, who had to figure out a way to keep these fucking rubes watching the over the channel uh shows, well these are the people who don't have the money. to watch HBO or cable, that means by definition, we have a ceiling on how much we want to pitch the people, because all of our ideas of what smart is comes from a college experience, the people who don't have the money for cable tend to not have, so we can't speak to them, we don't know how to talk to them, we can only condescend to them, well we might as well say as few words as possible, let's just train the cameras on them and let them entertain each other. pew and out of that process of programming towards that the person they had in their mind, the disgusting pig they had in their mind, they summoned this other team to rule over us, so it's yeah, the those are the those are now like the the the warlocks. those are the antichrist to now rule, it's like it is like the second coming, only they're both the antichrist, it's it's revelation where they're both the bad guy, which would make sense if you were a nostic, because that's not really god, that's yelboath, and who's this person, that's probably another conjured monster, that's it's it's he's there to keep you uh, keep you in misery. Yeah, Trump was summoned into his place in the political firmament by an incantation of Barack Obama, remember he, it was him making fun of uh Trump at the correspondence dinner that made him decide to run for president, don't fucking. the the high the the dark lord himself spoke unto the world and brought forth a demon for him to battle and destroy the world with their thrashings, and the problem is if that's our thesis, and that's our antithesis, I cannot imagine any synthesis emerging that is not uh, a even more deeply uh satanic monstrosity, like that would be like forming into uh voltron like blorbing into each other and creating a new monstrosity. not good, no uh, our hope can be only that that that like synthesis that that that dialectic between Trump and Obama is embedded within the larger dialectic of American politics and that a thesis, antithesis will emerge to that, that is our hope. I mean, there is an antithesis emerging, the question is will it gain um the ability to resist. and assert itself and build before we are pulled off of rick and bock falls into the misty waters below, that is a question for another time. have i?
