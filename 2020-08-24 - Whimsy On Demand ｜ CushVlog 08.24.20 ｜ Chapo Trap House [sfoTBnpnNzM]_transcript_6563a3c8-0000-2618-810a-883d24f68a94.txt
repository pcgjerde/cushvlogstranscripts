 Okay, I think now we've established, everything is inherelly worthless, and there's nothing in the universe, with any kind of abductive purpose, I scream a hundred years, split the sky with a thousand curses, I can do, you wouldn't we match the surface. too many implications, not enough time to make them specific, too many generalizations, not enough time to make them the back, hello, it's overcast, it might rain, i'm warning because if it gets really bad, i'll probably have to go inside, but if it's just drizzling, i'll be fine. the night the night is overcast, there is a forboding about about, there is this feeling of tension and and implication in the very air, but uh, i'll keep an eye on it, oh god, i look when i wear, this is a terrible shirt and it looks like crap and it has this big round terrible collar and i still remember that i fucking went on television wearing this fucking thing once, god i like to think that i have a little amaticam more uh social awareness to do that now, but I'm now on Twitch, which is I guess the modern television, and I'm wearing it, but it's i'm cycle through my clothing and I don't want to wear anything again to recently, I get neurotic about it, so now I got to take go to I got to do a load laundry, but man this shirt is really terrible, I should just throw it out so I don't even, I don't even like get tempted to... wear it, i am flexing with the drip, that's right, folks, i'm flexing with the drip, we are streaming the RNC uh, last week we just did tuesday, wednesday, thursday, this week though, because the republicans are always more fun and have more juicy bullshit uh, i mean the first night we're going to have the gun couple from st louis, and DJTJ who are both the cant misses in my opinion, so me and loan option are going to be streaming tonight to uh, I don't who else will be on uh virtual sedy might do it, but it'll be at least us, but then we're going to have more Amber, Felix and other special guests will be all through the week, oh and on and on Wednesday I should put this out here, uh, before that and after uh the FYM team, the streaming guys, Tom and those gentlemen uh will be... doing a fundraiser for the Milwaaki Freedom fund uh related to providing I think jail support and other uh help to protesters after the horrifying police shooting that just happened in Kanosha uh and that's going to be happening before that's going to happen from seven to nine and then we're going to hop on at 9, we're going to do the convention and then we're going to do some more uh spofs and goofs with the FYM crew afterwards and that'll be donating raising money for the Melwaaki freedom fun, am I JFK Jr., well that's just ridiculous, come on, uh, what did Trump say about Bernie today? Is he trying to do the triangulation thing where he reminds people that Bernie's a good guy and wonderful and we love him uh and that the DNC stole the nomination from him, which is very, very clever, but very disingenuous, because if Bernie had gotten the nomination, I think honestly if Bernie had gotten the nomination, Trump might have fully embraced Q by now. he might be going, he wants to eat your children, this buse he's he was terrified of Bernie Sanders socialist appeal because he has an understanding cuz he's more connected to to popular trends than bloodless vampire republicans, he sensed that there was something stirring in the masses that could have potentially been connected to things like medical for all, i mean the guy wanted to run for president in 2000 on the reform party platform with medical fraw basically as the principal of domestic reform, he has that animal instinct. and so he was scared of burning and he would have nothing else so he would probably be full peing on because that would be the handdiest tool. the whole convention would be pictures of bernie like photoshop next to Anton lev and a big fondo pot full of baby brains. Folks, heats babies, this guy, this brirny Sanders, he seems like a great guy, he's a bad guy. Anyway, what did Trump say about Bernie? Did he say he would have been unbeatable? That's pretty funny because it's true, and he can admit it now that it's no longer a danger. so what did uh Trump say? i don't think he called him a trifling ho, that sounds ridiculous. he said he was the greatest loser of all time, that's that's overstating the case. i actually just rewatched the stuff, somebody asked me, i saw the blob, i rewatched the stuff. this stuff has good stuff in it, but it's not very good, it's a great performance by Michael Moriarty more than anything, and that's the thing about a lot of those Larry Cohen movies is that the movies aren't that great, but fucking Moriardi is fantastic, he's doing like this method goofy counterintuitive shit in all of his movies with them like that and queue that makes it interesting even if the direction's flat and it's very choppy, apparently it was much longer and the version, I don't know if there's ever been a director's cut, but the original cut of the stuff was much longer, and you can tell it's very very... uh herky jerky and uh and missing a lot of stuff, but it doesn't have a lot of energy as a result of that, but Michael Mariarty is fantastic, having Paul sorvino in there basically playing a fictionalized, slight lightly fictionalized version of Bow Grites, fantastic. Uh, Garret Morris is delightful as chocolate chipped Charlie, but the whole thing with the stuff, none of it really works. uh somebody says the next carter was the first guy who told people to uh to do more with less and he says no that there was like there was meat there was a whole thing about meat uh with Nixon but the thing about that is that was an emergency that was an emergency that was an emergency. situation and it was Nixon specifically, it was mixed with, it was part of a broader policy of kicking the kin down the road, because remember uh, so carter faced with the with the with the reality of stagflation decides to uh to start do austerity. Nixon was faced with that same option uh in his first term, but he was fully fixated on winning, because as I said, the democrats are super ego, the republicans are. id, Nixon wanted power, first and foremost, everything flowed from that. Carter wanted to think he was a good boy. Carter wanted to be a sanctimonious, good man. He was going to be the good man who redeemed America, America that had fallen, it was going to be redeemed by him, a person who embodied righteousness. That is not what Dixon was. Nixon thought he know knew of the future. And the funny thing is is Nixon is a guy who anticipates a lot of our current crisis. because Nixon saw coming because he presided over the the end of Bretton Woods and the beginning of the uh of the current uh floating Fiat system with the uh US dollars this global reserve currency, he saw the future, he knew this means that America will no longer be the productive power house of the world. America will not be able to be a net exporter, you can't be a reserved currency without connection to gold or some specie, you cannot be a reserved currency and in that exporter, it doesn't work, the money's got to circulate, it's got to be out of the country, that means people have to be, you have to be buying things from the rest of the world, that is unbreakable, that ch that had a lot of implications for the future of the American military project and at that point, the still hot cold, the still existing cold war, because Nixon didn't know that the Soviet Union was going to be gone soon, he thought they'd have to be reckoned with while America declined, and he was going to manage the decline, and that meant that whatever it took to... uh through to these dumb asses to get him elected what he would do, and so when he was faced with that crisis, he did not sit America down and told them, I need you to suffer, as I need to suffer. He told people, we're doing waging police controls, he did the thing that no republican was supposed to do, the thing that made, the thing that made Milton Friedman shit rivots, because he wanted to get reelected, because he didn't want to cause his recession. Carter's policy in uh, this is not a joke and this is not a theory of mine, this is pretty well documented. Carter's economic project in his first term was to induce a recession. to stop inflation and then he had to run for re-election. you would do that if winning was what you cared about. Carter didn't care about winning because it wasn't about his what he was going to do to make America like manage, manage its actual government, it was what was he was going to do for its soul, he was what he was going to do for its spirit, but that's not that job, and that's that's one of the the horrors of the American presidency is because it is this civic uh god. it's this god king like there's so much energy around the presidency and they have so much actual power and they have so much psychic power and so much of it is put into the hands of one individual that that that the mechanics of power that they preside over and the spiritual like metaphorical internal uh spiritual processing of that material reality get in intermingled and so carter did not start from the principle of i know i could do to make America's uh government function, he was going to fix the spirit, but that wasn't what was the problem, there was no problem with that, it emanated from the structure, nixon understood that, i mean he didn't really give a shit about if America was moral or not, he wanted to be in charge, he was a fucking sick little pervert to got off on power because it filled the gaping hole in his in his stomach, and so Nixon says uh, no, we'll do raise wage and price controls. even though that was that's the kensian answer, that's like the that's the that that was the hegemonic new dealer answer, and that is why when Carter got in there, the only option anyone saw was austerity, because the only alternative, the left-wing alternative, the one that Teddy Kennedy ran on in 1980 was waging price controls and the thing is, when they said that was a bad idea, they were not wrong, we literally had just had wage and price controls under nixon and they didn't work, but that's all that was in the cansian covered, that was all that was in the new deal, the great society covered because it was trapped in the logic of the fucking capitalist system that demanded profit that demanded the uh that that that demanded a continued purchasing and a consumer matrix to offset the amount of alienation being being carried out through the process of uh of the wage relationship, in that context. "there's two roads, one of them you know doesn't work, but it could maybe work in the short term to may keep your party in power, and the other deals with the the actual uh, like econ political political economic malfunction within the system, transfers from the political to the economic, uh, and and chang and and actually addresses the problem, and that's what they chose, they chose austerity, and the thing is by addressing the problem in capitalist terms, what's this? oh, it increases exploitation? shit, it increases exploitation of third world people by turning them from peasants into uh, wage laborers, which means, yes, standard of living goes up, but so does exploitation and alienation, it does, and you can say it's a trade off worth making, but it's not one that those people are making by choice, it's not a democratic choice, it's being thrust upon them, they're getting more a higher standard of living, and in a lot of cases barely that. in exchange for giving up control over their uh environment, but but the but that's their decision or hypothetically you would think by people who claim otherwise to believe the idea that we are independent beings who deserve to make a choice in our destiny, but no, that just happens because it's invisible, because the market does it, the market draws people through capillary action from the country to the city and turns them into a proletariat, no one's hands are on the trigger. "there's no, there's no uh, there's no emptying, you're not empt, like Pault emptied the cities by gun point, and that's a horrible thing, and it was, but filling those cities was a horrible thing too, but there was no, you didn't need to put a gun on anybody, and so and and in the country in the US, which had been the arsenal democracy, and then then the winner of World War II, and then the sole industrial beheemeth of a world." coming back into a demand for a civic fucking consumer infrastructure which we provided, but in so doing we also had to stand up our former enemies to keep them from being subsumed by the Soviets, which depleted our ability to dominate the uh the export markets and decreasing profits for American industry uh and then putting pressure on the Brettonwoods uh dollar system, which resulted in Nixon taking us off gold. which meant that if we were going to still be the reserved currency, we had to run a massive trade deficit, which we have basically ever since, and that is why anybody talks about how like there's some right populism that's going to come up. and it's going to from the like the economic left outflank the democrats like Tucker Carlson's going to lead some hair involk democracy that it's going to really bring the jobs back instead of just say they're going to do like Trump that's wishful thinking in certain degree like I mean even if you say it would be horrible you at least would love to see some sort of acknowledgement that we are masters of our economic destiny but they would in order to do that they would have to be willing to get rid of the world reserve currency being uh the... american dollar and go towards something that Kane suggested at Bretten Woods which was to have a global exchange currency that was not tied to anyone national economy. Do you think Tucker Carlson's going to sign up for that globalism? Fow out of here. But that's the thing. That is how you can that's you got Nixon and Carter basically the same problem in front of them and what determined. their action is which psychological like what what what role that they think they're doing and republicans because they're the id of the system think that they're operating out of uh just drive blind drive that's then cloaked in righteousness however they try to tell themselves. the democrat thinks of themselves first and formost as someone who exists to be a virtuous to be outward focusing even though it's in this context of capitalism where that is rendered a joke by the reality of the brutal oppression and alienation of capitalism and the desacralization of all exchanges and the replace them with them replacement of them by market relationships which are inherently sterile and which accumulate towards exploitation. you don't, you're not going to wreck it with that, but so but you're going to try to be a good person, and so you either put a cynical lid on inflation so you can get to that second term and negotiate that trilateral uh deal with the other world powers that puts us on... position to step down from dollar hegemany in a way that doesn't destroy our uh our economic system so we can like have a hand off to a more globalized system of world capitalism where we're no longer the headquarters but we keep most of the uh the the luker because we're like senior partners the way that this uh the way that the uh uk did after World War II I got to do it I'm Nixon I'm the smart guy I can do that. on the other hand, it's like, oh, people need to, people need to learn to live with less and be less consumers, be more citizens, put more of investment into their lives around them and not in what they buy, really, are you going to do anything to change the thing that makes America, consumer society, any of the brutal alienating factors that replace all of our meaning with dollar worth, like we replace any kind of abstract, spiritual, worth with concretized dollar worth and all and you're going to tell people you need to live on less, but we're not going to let you live in any different way, you still need to fucking pay the the rent every fucking month, you still need to save for your kids college, you still uh need to work 40 or 50 hours a week for a boss wh tells you what to do and whoose labor and takes your labor and keeps it for himself, the vast majority of it, and you got to live in a physical. that keeps people apart from each other and and a mass media topped on top of that that that uh further alienates and splinters and keeps people away and replaces the social with some imagined monoculture that you're all participating in spike like at theric plane but never interacting with personally never generating from the ground up but you but you're going to be able to find more meaning in life even though conditions for your life haven't changed right? no you're going to listen to another guy Ronald Reagan when he says fuck that shit cut. we still get the party and then what happens is the volka shock ends up uh doing what Carter wanted to do and said we needed to do which was balance the economy on the back of workers by breaking labor power and the demand of the labor share of profit, which is one of the things that did drive inflation, it's not like it didn't drive inflation, but it's the one driver of inflation that they essentially decided to get rid of, they knew. labor flatline on the chart for the last 40 years, but they did it behind our backs, they did it slowly, they did it under morning in America, they did it with the Reagan finery around it, and people didn't even know it was happening, Carter, because he was honest wanted to tell people up front what he was going to do to them, and as long as there's another party that's not bound by your weird kink, your weird subconscious need to be uh to be uh seen by others as virtuous, this this uh part of this, this party that exists to suppress the urges for the greater good without confronting any of the under. psychosis that generates that desire, which is the actual reality of capitalism, the unexamine ego, you want people to like be wide awake when they get uh their medicine, you're going to lose, and then the other party is going to win, which is what they've been doing ever since. the sacadas are out there, they're click clacking away, people are telling me that that was a squirrel the other day by the way, that was just holering, that's terrifying, they just look so cute and fluffy, i did not know they could make noises like that, is step family porn assiob? You know, I'm starting to think that the the conspiracy mindset that's now emerging on the left, it's not obvious, it's not the same thing as the Q and on thing, in fact the Q and on thing is like a flight from reality, and I think that the uh conspiracy mongering on the left about stuff about what Syops also counts as a sort of step for, it's it counts as a step forward for some people, which is why I think it's to be encouraged, whereas the the uh the Q1 is to be lamented, not like anything you can do. but just to look on with horror and be like, oh god, oh god, I'm not talking about, I'm not talking about truan, I feel like those guys do their homework and and their shit is real, and that like there are ops, obviously, ops are everywhere, what I'm saying is the instinct people have that is generated by this new awareness that Ebstein helped create of the reality of parapolitics to say everything that you encounter is is an op, that's what I'm talking about, what that is is people are essentially trying to psychially redpill themselves towards an awareness of of like capitalism like trying to get the no liv glasses on you know trying to forge the no liv sorry the they live glasses of of socialism but you know it's it's it's not going to be fast and easy for everybody because a lot another this stuff is intuitive if you grew up in America like it runs counter to everything you've been taught the deep ideology and pushing against that is difficult. and I feel like understanding on one level that all social uh phenomenon are generated not by our inate like uh our individual sins, our individual deficiencies, like bad things in culture, bad things in society don't just come from us being bad people, like choosing to do bad, that that moralistic calvinist framework, that's not true, that's that's the that's a fan, that's a spook that's meant to mystify you uh, it's generated by the social relationship, the the actual relationship of production that shapes the world everyone lives in, making people's uh, making life, making daily life is what makes bad things happen, because it's generated by those those interactions, by by that that that fundamental, the fundamental quest for sustenance of all kinds that makes up human existence in a social context. but it's hard to hold on to that because it's abstract and it's hard to connect it to the world around you, because it's so far removed from your experience of events, and i feel like it is an intermediate step for people trying to get deeper to the idea of these things being generated by by the social order to like they can't get there, they can't stay there, but where they can stay create like imaginatively is to some some expression of that order in the form of intelligence, in the form of the deep state, in the form of the the the men in black, and then say, aha, I understand that school shootings or step-mom porn, I understand that these aren't because we are not doing this because we're naughty people, we're sinful people, we don't deserve nice things, these aren't, these aren't the expressions of a six society is in sick citizens, it's an expression of a social relationship that is untenable and producing more. more horrifying, alienating lives for the people who live in it that is generating more and more profanity of spirit. uh, but it is an agent of our structure that does it, the CIA, the deep state, that's that's connects you, it's the it's the it's the linkage between just events as they occur and and as they coales into trends. we recognize and the the the the superstructure and then the base, it connects the two, connects base and superstructure as a mental architecture as I like to use that term, I know I say it too much, but in this... case i'm literally meaning like a like a piece of fucking connective tissue or a bridge, a bridge. so um, so i i say, so that's why i don't get mad at people when they want to ask, they want they want think everything's an op, i just say, there are opps, but they're not everything because if they're everything then we have no agency at all. right, if everything, but that's there's a paradox there, if everything is an op, then they wouldn't need to do ops if you know what I mean, you've reached the point where you're not really uh, you're you're you've stepped back too far, you're you're not describing discrete, you're not, you're turning them the map into the territory basically, buse like every like there are events within a there's like a sheet of events rippling out you know and they form in. to events that have patterns to them, and some of them are cause of some things and some of the cause are other things. at a certain point you've lost descriptive ability if the thing that you're describing is what is responsible for everything. so that that leaves you with a situation of, well some things are real and some things aren't, how do i find out, you actually have to like look into it, you actually have to start, you have to assume that they aren't and then and then change your opinion based on discovering more evidence that they are. you have to start from an assumption that they aren't all, because at this point there's so much amor for shit in the internet and it's so easy to get curated versions of events, even if you don't even realize that's what you're searching for, the way that people might not even know that they're the ones moving the uh planchet in a game of wiiji, you're you're punneling into a reinforcing uh epistemic circle without even being aware of it, so you got to start from the assumption that they aren't and then have to be convinced, like it's it's it's it's a like there's a reason that it became that that's the basis of like the English common law because it is a uh it's a epistemic tool to array things into like into yes or no propositions where's your starting position and it needs to be know or else everything will just piles up like step. i see it absent any evidence if everybody is literally if if a bigger and bigger percentage of people stay at home and a bigger and bigger percentage of people uh get divorced or at least you know at this point a solid 50% of marriages divorce but more and more people live at home, the amount of interactions between step parents and stepchildren is going to increase exponentially over time, people covet what they see. every day, claries, i mean, part of it is for me is like for a lot of these neets, especially like porn addicted nets who are like the consuming a lot of the porn, which is a lot of people, because there's a lot of people just just watch porn or mostly watch porn in terms of their sexual life, and uh, they don't have jobs. the the what what are they going to do with a a fantasy of like having sex with somebody at the water cooler? they they don't have a fucking job, they live in their parents house, they don't go anywhere, they're on the internet all day, the only woman they engage in any way with in a given moment or maybe their stepmom or whoever lives in their house, so giving them a fantasy of having sex with their stepmom is a fantasy that's achievable in their mind is like a possible thing as a gateway, it's something to intensify the pleasure, buse you can imagine actually having sex with somebody in your house, oh you're going to go on a date? you're going to interact with a strange woman? that's too much of a fantasy. so and same thing with like mass shootings, i think america has messed up enough to produce people who snap and shoot each other, considering how many guns and how much just unregulated social dysfunction we've got, uh, and if you have, but if you have specific evidence, i'll listen to it, i just think that like you need to just start from a position that these things aren't and then you have to be convinced and like I think the thing like True and on is good because I think they're actually a model for doing it, but the problem is is that like it takes riger to do it the way they do and it's much easier to just sort of have a hip off the hip take. but that's because people that's that's because like the stakes are lower your take you know you're not you're not a professional podcaster that take is matter it's just going to crew some likes or whatever but if that's the case just like well then why have an opinion at all like why do you have to have a take at all why not if there's nothing in it for you like my thing with a lot of the issues people demand i have an argument about and like have a real strong opinion about it's like well what does it benefit me to have this opinion? what does it benefit anyone else to have an opinion about something that has by definition to be largely cut off from any deeper understanding of it that i could even lean on? but the thing is everything gets flattened so q and on doing like rigorous stuff gets turned into takes for everything and then that turns into your worldview now you know obviously as i have said a million. times, if it's happening online, it doesn't matter, but if enough people have like the wrong world of view in their head, it's hard for them to uh to act effectively, but you can't convince them of that, and that's why you can't change it at the level of the discourse, because they have to experience it for themselves, they have to have a real experience in life that leads them in one or another direction. you cannot convince them out of it, you might convince that a few people, but the the uh efficacy is so low, that it and I must point out that the backlash is so much more, like I would say that I think you could definitely argue successfully that the discourse has changed the minds of people, but I would make another argument that is just as you, unbound by facts, like this isn't a thing we could decide for us, but empirically this is purely a rational exercise, because we're not going to be able to ever get this information, and everything that will be called information is going to be anecdote, so I would say on the question of whether it's like the discourse is is an effective place to fight, I would say this, there's two propositions, one is that more people have their minds changed by encountering arguments online than are reinforced in bad opinions that lead to bad outcomes by the very act of observing and engaging in the online argument. and you cannot prove either of these, you have to just say what into yourself which one you think is more realistic, which one is fits with your vision of like your rational mind, your reason, which one seems more reasonable to you, that more people discretely as individuals read an opinion that is that is uh right, interact with their wrong opinion and have it change, and this is important. not just switch from one wrong opinion to the other buse that happens, but that's different and you'd have to be able to say, no, no, no, not when anybody, not like when chong goes from sjw to red pill, like that doesn't count, he changed his mind, even if you you can say it was cynical, but say it wasn't, that happens sometimes, that doesn't, that's not good, you have to say that that happens enough to be worth spending that time there, barring how much time people spend there, how much energy? is put there, there's another proposition that says that whatever that number is that people change their mind towards something better, it is by far overwhelmed by people who are reinforced in wrong opinions by engaging in this stupid bullshit in the first place, and i would say a good example of that is the thing in Kansas, which became this battle of like absolute propositions, human like dignity. "the ability to like be a human being without without your attempts to live your life in good faith being destroyed by some monstrous uh uh mechanism of of of punishment, this fukoian nightmare uh or or the proposition that uh that there is like this monstrous misogenous left that essentially just wants to uh you know create" a haronvolged democracy around uh around socialized labor uh but subjugated socialized public labor but subjugated private female house house labor and it's like holy shit that's a big argument damn i see the point on both sides what's this about? it's about a 19-year-old running for state legislature. why is a 19-year-old running for that seat? because and this is where this is where the fucking mystification of the discourse comes in all the only way people filter the stuff. like's a good candidate, in the political sphere's a good guy, who's a bad guy? it's do they have the right opinions, right? because it's just i'm running for congress on a platform of these opinions, and so this is the shiboless i talk about when i talk about how online argumentation just creates lines where everything is just a formal shivel, so that means that when you're evaluating a campaign or a candidacy or an event, the only thing that matters is what they say about anything, but there's a reality that you're trying to elect somebody to a job and presumably that is supposed to be an advance for forces of good, they're supposed to do something in that office that is positive. i would suggest and submit that a 19-year-old by definition cannot do that. they do not have the life skills, mental uh uh competence, knowledge based uh maturity to do it, and more importantly, the social ability to negotiate, the the halls of power, no... identify good faith from bad faith actors among the current legislators, picking your moment with pieces of legislation to make to to actually push something forward. find out who you can deal with in good faith and who would require you to get rid of your morals if you have them, if you're not just saying it, and how would we ever know if you weren't just saying it? the devil can quote scripture if he wants to, so i say a 19-year old can't do that job, and you could say, well then no one else, there was nobody. that district to stood up, would you rather have no one stand up? honestly, yes i would, i would rather have no one do it than a 19-year-old, and the fact that a 19-year-old did it tells me that whatever the situation is in Kansas, uh, that legislature was never going to do anything, he wasn't going to serve as a beacon, he wasn't going to like lead some sort of realignment, because there is no ground work, there is no social base to generate anything other than a 19-year-old, no one else, step forward, that is fallow ground, now you can run in fallow ground if you have uh, some sort of connection to a project, but being 19 tells me there was no project, it's just people doing what they want to do, it's people going from, hey, one vote is just one vote, this isn't really doing politics to me running for offices doing politics, but really it's not that much more, because these things have to multiply along axis of ordination, we have to do these things in concert, the or the activism has to be the kids bouncing the basketball in the goddamn Chinese video everyone's talking about, and if it's a 19-year-old, then the structure did not exist to generate anything viable there, and all the other arguments that became world-ending, questions of morality are built on a edifice of delusion. "if people look through that lens of that event realistically, they would say, do I have to say anything about this at all? and they would say, no, that's not cowardice, that is triage, and the only way that that doesn't make sense to you is if the only access is the is the is the access of ideology and getting the right opinions and dividing the good from the bad, but like I said, you could say this guy is a good guy, and the evidence is. look at the things he says and look at the things he believes in, that's one thing you have to judge somebody by, and it certainly beats judging them by whatever the hell democrats talk about, like he said he's a nice person, he said he likes ice cream and he said he thinks I'm cool, it's much better for it to be cold political points of view, but those are still just things you can say because nobody is acting from a position of power, it's all air, words are wind and they're not just wind and you have. to use them as a first step, but then guess what happens, you organize first by what people say and then what by they do, and I'm sorry, there's nothing you've done by 19 that necessitates, especially at state senate in Kansas, that necessitates that level of investment, you have to be deluted, you have to be stuck on this narrow strip of ideological combat between other people, all of whom are caught in the epistemic chamber, totally disconnected from the broader working class completely. and even if you're right in a narrow sense, you are wasting your time, and everyone was some time, you your life, I mean wasting time is one of the things that makes uh life bearable in undercurrent conditions, but you might be wasting time that we don't have to waste, see this person says what if he's a 19-year-old with a unusually savy political mind and a movement behind him, movement that produces a 19-year-old candidate is not a a movement that I respect. How about that? Because ideas aren't the only thing, ideas aren't the only thing. there's a you're you live in three dimensions and one and there's a social dimension to life, like you're trying to turn these things into just like you're trying to turn them into this abstracted battle of ideas instead of a real attempt to gain power through human existing political structures. there was nobody older than that in your movement, you aren't there yet, and that's not that doesn't mean don't try for it, it does mean that whether you win or not is not the end of the world. It's epinomenal, because there is there to track, and this is what gets a lot of people confused about the efficacy of electoral politics, is that there are two tracks of electoral politics that are going to emerge from the left moment that we're living into the extent that it exists, one is going to be coordinated action involving organizations of different levels of of volunteer and cadre intensity coming together th coalitions to... coalesce around candidates that agreed to an existing platform and work in concert with others and then there are going to be adventurous people who inspired by that movement decide on their own to do it, there is nothing that they're not ops, some of them might be, there's no, you shouldn't assume any of them are ops until you presented with evidence to the contrary, uh, they are totally, totally in 100% um, earnest and they want what's best for everyone, but because they're Americans, they don't know what that means, they're guessing like we all are, they're struggling blindly through the dark, that's why that's what's the class project is, it's people halloring in the dark until they can hear each other and then they can hold hands and then they can lead each other out of the fucking darkness, people doing it outside of the context, it's they're not hurting anything necessarily, unless their battle becomes a huge sink for resources and attention that it doesn't deserve, but it is just going to be somebody haullering out to the darkness because they're not hearing the other voices, and it's like, yeah, it sucks to be able to figure out which one's which, but you got to do it, you got to try, frandhampton didn't run for anything, it's levels of accountability with... an organization you can trust people because you have a level of accountability that's involves personal relationships, elected officials are abstracted from that, so you have less of a social dimension to your control over their actions and that has to be filled by their own virtues, and you can only know that through the accumulation of their actions to that point, which require, which require maturity, all these categories are getting confused in people's minds, i'm not going to say a 19-year-old. lead a fucking political grassroots political organization that involves like committees of people who are in in absolute uh like uh relationship to one another and accountable to each other life of the officials aren't accountable to anybody and the thing is this is going to be a problem because we've talked a lot about how the middle section of America political class the people who might realistically run for office has been completely gutted uh and that it's created a political class that is reinforcing and part of a born managerial class and that it's going to have to emerge from the working class, that's true, but it has to at some point these things have to come into contact with other spokes, with other nodes in order to be reinforced into a meaningful action, or else they are just spent uh pointlessly, see this is the thing, people say you saying a kid can't do something, running for office is qualitatively different. and this is the thing, everybody wants to do everything, the idea that there's anything constraining anyone's relationship to any action is horrifying, and why is that? because we're operating out of a libidinal understanding of politics, whereas much as we think we want what's best for everybody, at the end of the day what we really want is what's best for what we think we want, and we have confused those to an extent or they're overlapping to an extent that we can delute ourselves further into thinking that our personal selfish pursuits are for the greater good. but at some point that turns into an unsustainable delusion, and you know when that point is, when you connect to other people, and then they check you and you realize, oh, I can't do this, as long as you're online, as long as you're fighting these battles in the virtual space, then you can do anything and you can be anybody. I mean the sunrise movement, I mean I I I definitely. that's a step in the right direction compared to one-offs runs for congress and shit by by people who have no experience or understanding of what they're doing and are not connected to anything broader than like a friend network or a bunch of people on a Facebook page or a subreddit uh but it's they're also showing that they are their kids they're figuring it out like the way they got rolled on the on the uh it was very predictable the way they got rolled on the mors thing you could have seen that coming a mile away and one of the things that would have aided that was maturity was a little more experience to know what what principles like how principles should be applied in reality instead of just like squirting squid ink out of virtue because that's all you've learned because your politics is until very recently because you're young by definition only involves signaling. um, I mean, I just think if somebody had that in the record, they would say, oh, I'm a bad candidate for this, I shouldn't do this, because as much as you can say that the uh, the mob was wrong and awful and disgusting to see, it was, how do you not assume that's going to happen, because the number of people I see who complain every day about the awful bang are now outraged the anti-woke the the woke bobs are out again, but what did you expect to happen? and essentially what they assume happened hope to happen was what no one will find out, you can't operate off that assumption in a political battle, these people are fucking monsters, look what look what the fuck richard angle or what the fuck's his name, the guy in the guy, put the honey, the weird honey trap for morce, look what look what one of fucking franklin roosevelt's grandson was involved in that fucking badger game, this is this is capital you're dealing with, these are the cosmic forces of nature, these are the warlocks who have seased control, who actually wield power in this structure, you're not going to exploit every fucking thing they can, and then have armies of of useful idiot woke people who are going to grasp on to and a chance to show their virtue again and a chance to show how they're the they're the good people and to find heretics to burn, you don't think they're going to do that, of course they're going to fucking do that, that's what they do. and you what, you're going to tell them not to, like you do every fucking day, how's that been going, how has been telling them not to do it been going, it's an irresponsible thing to do in the first place, and as bad as and horrible as it is to drag a kid for that, it is irresponsible to do it in the first place, and it's not his fault, it doesn't make him a bad person, it means he didn't have anybody to tell him not to do it, and why didn't he have anybody to tell him what to do, why didn't he tell anybody to, why didn't he have anybody to tell him not to do it, because he's didn't have anybody who had any fucking perspective on this outside of we should be, we should be running for office, we need to be the ones in power, because voting isn't enough, and the thing is is like the horrible thing is i can say all that and people and there and then say, well then what, and that's the horror, that's the nause is that i don't know, because by definition it can't be any of this stuff. but where else are we able to feel that we're acting, it's a nightmare, and that is where that is where changing material conditions come in as just a thing to cling to, a thing to get you through the day, but also a reality, not just coping, but part of it is coping is realizing, i don't know it's gonna but I do think it requires people to take a good hard look at their relationship to politics in terms of what they think is effective action and to challenge themselves to ask themselves deeply, do I want this because I think it'll do any good in the world or do I want this because it satisfies some need. some social need to be reaffirmed in a social platform and the hope, the only hope we have is that enough people will ask themselves that and by asking themselves that able to they are able to clear the foggy windshield of their perception of the world around them and the path forward, the leap of faith, and I know that sucks, because people want to fucking blueprint, but it has to be felt. you have to be driven by by a a self, an engine of self-interest of some kind, and it's either our our libidinal self-interest or it is a deeper understanding, it is a deeper understanding of the greater good, that emotionally encompasses everyone, and not just us, and that is very hard to come by, and it's not something even that once you feel you just keep feeling, you have to work for it, and it goes away, because the the world in front. was the raid before you is this buffet of pleasures and this litney of horrors that you have to negotiate, and that drives you towards self-satisfaction to self-comfort, it drives all of us, but we have to find a practice in our lives to allow a clarity to see the distinction between us and the world around us, recognize the delusion, that delusion for what it is, and genuinely feel a social obligation. and materialism and every ism, and science and and and technology more than anything, and capitalism, most of all, we are different things and we have to recommit, we have to re, we have to resaculize the world on a new uh, a new foundation, and it's going to include you, the language and vocabulary and mental worlds of existing religions, because that's what people have in their head, that's what has meaning to them already, and they're going to have to ac will accrew meaning along those axis, but that meaning will not be, the the the sectarian, horrible religion practiced by most, you know, religious people in the world, sadly, but a broader spiritual awareness, a risematic understanding of of interest is comingling, an emotional, that's the thing, a lot of people understand uh, as a matter of intellectual exercise, that we are all to in this together the way Bernie said. that we genuinely are social beings who need to act from a social basis, we understand that intellectually, but we don't really feel it, we and this was true for me for many years, I understand that intellectually, but at the end of the day I'm still me and they're them, I perceive myself as outside of them, and so therefore I have to get mine first, a spiritual understanding of the world that I'm talking about, understands, oh no, no. "there is no distinction meaningfully to be made between me and them, and by them, I mean everybody, honor, there's no meaning, there are gradients of like uh, of familiarity that array along like symbolic orders that we've encountered in our lives, but they are just gradients, they're gradients of of that add up to the demirgical shadow reality we fight ourselves in, but in reality everyone is me, and what that means is is that you are operating libidnally from a posi transition of altruism, not managing to go through, not ideologically transitioning from self-interest to uh alshurism, genuine, like your self-expression is towards an understanding of a social obligation, and I'm not saying people are bad if they don't have that, I don't think I was a bad person when I didn't have that, and by the way, I don't have that all the time. it's it's a it's a flight b that is flickering at all times, it it dots out and it fls up and i have to work to ten that motherfucker uh that that is not something that is blaring and it's like i'm not a better person, i'm not some sort of uh a better person than people who don't think that way because you can operate from personal from a personal uh perspective and do good things and be a good person, absolutely and someone i respect, but i'm saying is that if that's the only way people operate. people in aggregate, not individually, people in aggregate will move towards pathological behavior, will move towards undermining their own uh efforts and undermining their own uh movements, but that's not individual judgment of individual people, it is an it is a recognition of the law of large numbers, if everyone's operating out of self-interest, eventually, especially in a culture like ours, those are going to in like these things are in everyone, these instincts are in everyone and have to be battled and uh are part of life and part of the struggle of life and getting towards a position where we all feel that is what we're talking about when we're talking about the world's spirit coming into recognition of itself. this is what we're talking about when we mean the teleology of marxism is a moment when everybody is operating from a felt position of interconnection, not a reason position of interconnection. that's when you get rid of the idea of coersion. that's when the state literally doesn't need to exist and markets don't need to exist because no one is operating from us position of self-interest at all, but it isn't, but the thing is is that it cannot be enforced, you can't do it through reeducation camps or goologs, you can't do it through rude propaganda, people have to feel it, they have to feel it because they have to live in conditions that allow them to feel it, that is why we have to all make leaps of faith every day to make the world more like that in our interactions with each other, so the people can sustain it in their hearts and give it to others until enough people have it that we can stave off disaster and write the fucking ship, i hope that made sense a little bit, i am not on acid, no, not on acid, i hope some of that made sense, some people are mad at me, but i'm good, if people have honestly, i i do think if people i get, i i have open dms, i talk, i read, i read the reddit about me "if people got problems, i i about my stuff, i definitely encounter it and i and i try to reason it out. i just don't want to do it in a public forum because that contributes to the debate bullshit i hate uh in the preening and it makes me less likely to act the way that i know i should, it makes me more likely to dissemble and be dishonest and to use uh solipcistic trickery in order to get my way because of my awareness that i'm competing and in front of an audience, it it it brings out the worst in me, i think it brings out the worst than a lot of people, not everybody, some people thriving." in terms of it making them better able to you know engage with the truth, for me it gets me farther from the truth and farther from the best version of myself, but i engage with feedback, so let me know if i'm off the rails here, all right? Maybe I'll take a couple questions, that one pretty, wow, holy crap, that was an hour, wow, I got to say that was kind of a blur, um, so yeah, maybe a couple cool down questions, and yes, uh, nine, 8:30 tonight, me and Lowan Oftion will be starting our RNC stream, it's there's a lot of lamos tonight, but we've got the fucking gun couple, which I'm very excited for, and DJTJ who is. I really hope that he like kills it because I really want him to run for a president someday because he's the real he's the real deal he's the copy of the copy of the copy he's like if if the uh if the fourth copy of Michael Keatan in multiplicity if someone copied him. If that sounded too abstract and like not grounded that's... because I'm describing the actions of people a people, I say like a people, like a subgrouping of Americans who are essentially frictionless in their mental realm, like even when they interact with other people, they're they're they're bevelling the world, and I'm a part of it, I'm not saying I'm not, they bevel the world around their psychic world, like the fixation on like seven, seven warning signs on a guy's bed or seven books that is a warning sign if a guy has on his shelf, I mean it boils down to editing people to be... reflections perfect reflections of your opinions, it's it's it's literally shed shaving the world down to the to the shape of your opinions that you totally that are totally detached from reality and totally generated from entirely hypothetical conversations online, so I feel like yes, this is all like flighty, but I mean i when I talk about something that's more grounded, I like to think that I'm I can, I can summing it, but right now there isn't. This is, this is the the pseudo reality that people are spinning their wheels within. There is no way to ground it. It is purely generated and does not reconnect except through the discrete actions of individuals whose actions. dissipate because they're not cumulative, because they're not coordinated, and I will admit that I'm good at thinking frictionlessly because I'm one of these people, I know how the bastards think, I am one of, I have been staring at this machine for 20 fucking years, it is rewired my brain in ways that I are, maybe you're reperable, and I'm trying to... make some sort of uh understanding of it, like some sort of retrospective understanding of what it did to me and how I can move forward from it without reinforcing all of the bad things. Okay. No, I would actually say that uh, somebody asked to the star, the the the chapo if they were on the enterprise, uh, I would say, Will is obviously Captain Kirk, Felix is spock, I'm bones, uh, Amber is Scotty. Oh and Virgil uh is uh the computer all right guys uh I'm out of here I'm bushed I need to eat bye-bye.
