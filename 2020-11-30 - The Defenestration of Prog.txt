 This actually worked for once, I want to knock it over, oh boy, there we go, come on, we've got viewers, presumably, oh, that tweet go out. hot twee action, it's indoors, it's raining here in New York, it's crummy. I have to have class in, I have to have recess inside, not pref, not ideal, but what are you gonna do, we're gonna have to get used to this, one way or the other, yeah, the beard's getting a little big, I'm gonna have to cut it again, because I realize that especially on these streams, my fucking... head gains 10 pounds after a certain density of beard and it it's like the zard's head showing up and spewing guns and sandwiches i shave it down and all of a sudden i look slender again it's a good it's a it's a classic trick some is asking for my steely dan opinion i do not have have one, all I know about Steely Dan, named after a sex toy that's uh, in naked lunch, originally had Chevy Chase as the drummer before he uh left, presumably because nobody could stand him, because he's one of the least appealing men on earth, that they're known for very beautifully and richly textured studio productions, they're sort of the opposite of the grateful dead in that ray. regard and that they have very uh lyrics that are according to some profound and incredibly uh clever and brilliant sanheimy and and others uh pretentious as to the actual music I don't know don't care haven't really listened to it is dirty work steely dan buse that is a great song all right well that helps I didn't know that was that was. really dt i don't realling in the years is them too right? i hate that song, so it's one and the other then, i really don't like realling in the years, but i really really do enjoy dirty work. uh, and i don't know why steely dance becomes the topic of internet conversation every three months. there are a few things that reliably pop up like old faithful. david foster wallis is one of them, steeley dann is another. it seems a lot of it is about like this ritualistic uh bringing down of i cons of like of some sort of perceived overlord, cultural overlord, because obviously DFW stands in for white male literary cannon, right? and and I think Steeley Dan serves a similar purpose and standing in for this boomer era idea of like hipster rock and roll, cause Dan, I mean from little I know about it, just to given its reputation, it does kind of seem like the David Foster Wallis of Rock Me music right, like it's got a similar demographic, only older obviously uh, and it's got a similar cachet among similar types of people and gets similar resistance, similarly found to be cold and unengaging by those who don't appreciate it, yeah, i have really realized somebody, the thing about like hating steely dan is about hating. It's like hating DFW is hating your boyfriend and hating steely Dan is hating your dad, so if you're online doing the discourse of bringing one of them down, that is the direction of your air, so I guess that's how you can chart the lunar cycle is when the boyfriends are getting a little annoying, it's time to remind them how much you hate DFW and the literary bros and then whenever you're thinking back on your you know withholding. or distant or in some way unsatisfying father figure, time to drop - steely dan and then of course radio head, well yeah no, radio head is the direct like your brother's... band, but they don't get the ritualized hate that Steeley Dan does, because it's for a different generation of dudes that they're mad at. Uh, someone wants to go, somebody wants to go over my birth chart. I know what it is, I am a libra, capricorn, moon, leo rising, earth wind fire, nobody get mad at me for saying saying. talking about astrology, it's not real, no one thinks it's real, it's just fun, and more importantly, it's a way to talk about yourself with other people in a way that doesn't seem as self-absorbed, because it allows them to talk about themselves on the same in the same way, it doesn't rely on personal experience, it's like this secondary category where you can talk about yourself sort of an abstract as opposed do events in your life, and that gives it gives other people a chance to play along, and it's not alienating the way. you know uh just a narcissistic uh way to talk about yourself would be. i will say this though that like if you do invest it with just the suspension of just belief necessary to care enough to like look into it, it's very easy to see how people get excited about it because there are tr and of course everyone knows well yeah that's because these are just these are just collections of human traits into like groupings and everyone is going to recognize. themselves in it because everyone has all of these traits, yes, but humans are pattern recognizing animals and so when you see it you are going to be like, oh shit, that really does track, like i got to say that i do feel like a libra, i feel like that's right, of like the sketches that go along with the different signs, i feel like yeah, that's the one that if you just said what do you think you are, i would think that was me, but then again i can't pull apart the fact that I know that, you know, that's why it's not real, but like I said, fun, but yeah, it's all fake, but the thing is, it's no more fake than myers briggs personality test, like how many people hate astrology, but put have like intj in their fucking bio, it's all made up. cap moon is my discipline side indeed to the degree that i have any discipline which is not much young definitely is a based weirdo. there's no question, it's amazing how youung and freud were both right, like in broad strokes, like in their understanding of like the way the brain operates at an individual level, and then how that uh, the fact of living among humans who all experience things the same way, generates this third this other dimension that uh that young was able to uh to recognize. like you're essentially talking about macro and micro psychology there uh i i was very b i i so he was asking if i ever uh if i was going to learn an instrument i uh i played saxophone for a year when i you had in my my my my elementary school your like your fifth and sixth grade you had to join orchestra or band you had to do it and i picked band and i picked up I was not good uh and the thing is what killed it for me, I mean that's never really good, it never really felt very natural, but what killed my ability to keep doing it is that they stopped letting me cheat and write the names of the notes on the fucking uh music, because I could not ever read the notes, like I couldn't see the little note and know what it corresponded to. my brain is actually terrible, it cannot, and i realize that what i what it is is that my brain is just words, my brain is just a bunch of words, buse it still blows my mind to know that there are people, including people i know, and i know they're not lying to me, who say that they don't think in words, like their thoughts aren't articulated into language that is sort of heard in their mind, and i'm like, well what the fuck kind of brain do you have? what and yeah, like there are people who just see pictures and like they get sort of these every, my brain is complete words, so like anything that's that's not that, not as good. so notation uh um numbers, oh my god, i am so bad, i almost didn't graduate college because of i had to take one math class and i kept putting it off until the last semester and i fucking ate shit and i almost failed it, i think i didn't even know if i was going to fucking graduate until like uh like the last weeks of school. so it's weird knowing that, i mean and it's it's true, like that's one of the things that generates different personalities and different abilities is how your brain processes the information that's receiving, and my brain for whatever reason compulsively and and and inextripirably connects everything to a articulated. uh symbol and visual symbol i guess, but but like verbal in the sense I'm hearing it, I'm hearing it in my head, I'm not seeing the words printed out, uh, I'm doing text support apparently, apparently the the RSS feed for the podcast version of these is not updating, I'll tell Chris about it, and it'll be taken care of, I'm sorry. and it and it's how you, you, it's how you end up with people with different skill sets and different understandings of the world and different like people might experience the exact same phenomenon in their life and have it activate the exact same parts of their brain in the same way and have the thing that comes after that moment lead them in completely different directions based on the way that their brain structures the not the information. that it receives, and that's why I have no, I like thinking about it now, I think that's one of the reasons that I am very, I had a very hard time accessing the concept of spirituality for so long in my life, like I couldn't, I could not get myself to believing in anything, and it made me feel dettached from every emotion I ever felt, and it made me feel. i used to say that if that i thought that and now i feel like i've confirmed this for myself that religion is a physical faculty in that it is parts of your brain processing the information and adhering it to a motion in a way that leaves you with a residue of this this adherence to a system of symbols and i think that's correct and i don't think my brain work that way and now i think the thing that was keeping it from that is the simple fact that i so compulsively alienate myself from all experiences almost instantaneously in the form of turning them into symbols, and that means that emotions can't be felt, and the thing I've really come to realize in the last six months or so is that there is no information, there is no truth that is not adhered to feeling, that that emotions are in fact the fat, emotion like Ben Shapiro is an exemplar of like this kind of the kind of wrong world like failed you're to understand how reason works, how like what epistemology is, it's the same failing that i had, is the one that ben shipiro has and one that many many people do have, because we are more and more symbolically oriented over time because of our greater alienation from our lives, and our uh greater dependency on a symbolic, simulation of emotional connections in the form of engagements online, which are inherently symbolic in a way that physical engagements can't are not physical physical events, physical interactions, but even my physical interactions alienated to that point, and so for a while I remember when I first heard the phrase facts don't care about your feelings and it felt like, oh, I get why people like him, because it appeals to that notion that that there is such a thing as truth that is independent of emotion, and in fact now I realize, no Ben Shipiro, you little fucking moron, facts are feelings, they literally are feelings, hume was correct. down that point, all understanding of facts, all understanding of, all all reason is motivated by by feeling, and even mine was, but it was through this, it was through, it was through like a muffling, you know, it was, it was through a bedsheet or or or a towel stuffed in the mouth, you know, it was gagged, because I just could not access the moment, as soon as the moment passed, it was transmogrified. into this symbolic representation of itself, and as a result I felt like, okay, I'm just going to be a miserable, piece of shit who tries to distract himself from the knowledge that he's eventually going to die, which will over time drive him insane, because he will not be able to conceive of a world in which he is not in, because he is completely detached in his mind from all other things in the universe, which is in every level a delusion of senses, it is a delusion and a failure to actually perceive the world around you, it is a it is the fact of of of the happen stance of your brain chemistry and the life you live. creating a situation where you cannot access reality, you access a shadow, literally reversed mirror, fundhouse mirror of reality, in which no, it's not true that you are absolutely intertvined with every living thing, everything, period, that there is only one substance in the universe, the death is no more possible uh than the extinguishment of of time and space, you don't um... you don't feel that, you feel, oh no, i am the only thing in the world, the only thing in the universe, so the universe is end and mine are the same thing, and since i cannot conceive of that one, i can't conceive of the other, and so as the reality of it comes in contact with the fantasy of your eternal selfness, i just, i spent so much of my time as a hypochondria racked, miserable person, because that sense was always there, that's sense of looming annihilation, like I had my first uh, like, I had my first heart attack in my head when I was 14 years old at a fucking junior high assembly. I mean, and then I had my spinal injury in my teenagers years, which completely threw me off track and and let me feeling like anything could happen to my body at any moment, and that only made it worse, and so I, I live my life trying to distract myself from this reality, and then I could do it for the most part, but my failure. to do it completely, my failure to completely sublimate was evidence by my hypochondria, by this nagging sense of annihilation, which was just my body's awareness of its own finitude that couldn't uh be integrated into my brain's uh insistence that such a thing is impossible. now i'm out of dualism, i'm saying that that was what i was, and now i'm i'm out of dualism, i mean obviously. I rebound to it in moments of instinct, moments of accumulated, you know, habit that have come through that life tunnel, but it over time it's being reduced, but I'm saying is the dualism in my mind i think was was determined by the material reality of my brain, which for one reason or another, the experience and and biology, nature and nurture is unable to feel without symbolic abstraction and that's why it took psychedelics for me to break through that, it took my took a technology that just took the part of my brain that wasn't paying enough attention that was instantly that was not being engaged while everything else was turning the world into symbols and made me made me observe it, made me actually sense it and that extended uh that that expanded sensation broke through this wall that had been there that was this symbolic order that overodd my my senses and my real feelings. you get over one thing and then the other one, that's 100% correct. i would go through spells because i have a lot of pain associated with my back injury, including i'll be real with y'all uh some gastrointestal issues that lead me to have a lot of pain in my abdomen sometimes. for a while I was convinced that I had pancreatic cancer, I had colon cancer and that would stick in my head for months and it would kind of be this background anxiety, and then I would rationalized by myself, well if you had it, you'd be dead by now, and then I'm able to be like, yeah, that's right, that's not real, but then you know, I would have some sort of uh arming, some tingling in my fingers, a nerve issue because I have a lot of spinal issues. with my uh, I have a lot of nerve pinching and stuff, I have big herniated disc, so I would convince myself that various chest pains and arm sensations, but I was going to have a heart attack, and then once that was not, no longer logical to me, I would go back to cancer, and I was on this cycle, and the thing that broke it was this realization of where it was coming from, more than anything, and now the main thing that stops me from getting in those cycles is that I'm not afraid of the thing, I'm not afraid of what it would mean. if that was true, I mean obviously I am afraid of it, but I'm not as keanly afraid of it, because I am not as uh deluted about my separateness from everything else in the universe. and that is why i mean it's horrible to hear people get prescriptive about shit like man you got to do assist man but i find that especially if you find that you are in unable to feel it very well might be if you're watching this if you're listening to this if you're uh online all the time and the substitute shadow symbol world. of online is good enough to make up for the more emotionally rich experience of interacting with the world around you, then it very well me might be, because part of your brain is just not there, it's not, it's not perceiving enough to overcome that feedback loop of of the sensation and then the symbolic translation of the sensation, you need to speed it up, reuptake, which is really what psychodelics do is that they enhance reuptake, but the reason that you know it's you don't want to be prescriptive, more than anything is is that we have experience with this shit, the CIA brought LSD to America in the 60s and had Timothy Leary spread it around the country like Johnny Apple Seed and... and what did it do? what what was the what was the the the radicalism that was created out of that expansion of consciousness? it was bad news, i would say on on average, overall, bad news, i mean the way that people talk about how honestly, it's tires to hear people talk about, everything is an op online, but honestly, but if you wanted to say the internet in general is a fucking siap, considering its role. in channeling young, specifically young alienation from capitalism into cultural spectacle and it's like uh indulgence in narcissism, it has the same effect that LSD had on the uh new left, but in that case it literally was an op, it literally was, the CIA bought like 100 tons of fucking LSD from Sandados, they brought like 90% of the of the LSD on earth to. to the US, but the other thing is, the other thing that's gets you there is just sitting, refusing to allow the symbolic order to over all your senses and that requires you to give it nothing to symbolically render, give it nothing to turn into symbols, even your thoughts will run out if they aren't refreshed by exposure to new things, and that's what's does is that it robs you of the ability to drive your body into this or drive your mind into this symbolic revery because you're not getting new stimulie and that's like all psychodelics do is reproduce the sensory experience of deep meditation, it's just that to do deep meditation you have to already be able to like you know reward that experience you have to know you'... have to want to do it, like that's the big thing is that nothing gets done unless you really want to do it, is if your desire, your labinal energy has been channed into a genuinely felt connection to every other life in the universe, if it's not genuinely felt, you get back to the labinal politics that we're practicing now everywhere and it completely online and completely within the current political culture. but there's a yeah, there's a reason that people talk about waking up, the idea that it that the that thati moment is one of awakening to a consciousness, because you realize that what what made your life a nightmare is that it was a it was unconscious, you were not being conscious of the world around you, you were living in a symbolic haze, you were living in a demirgical shadow. the problem is is that you have to be able to keep accessing that and the and that's why just haphazard exposure to psychedelics that are pursued without rigor and without discipline won't lead to anything because that feeling has to be translated like for me what made this experience with with lsd different than other ones i done because i've done it plenty of times before i did it at fucking cpack the thing that made it different this time is that for whatever reason the thoughts i was having that led up to the the the actual emotion, the actual explosion of feeling and um and then come back came back down from we're connected in a way. that i could symbolically link that experience to a cause of reason that could convince my brain that it was true, because if i wasn't able to convince it symbolically i was never going to be able to feel anything because i couldn't access feeling. And that was when I started to feel you know that's when a lot of the things that felt a lot of things in my life that felt impossible became possible because the the artificial structures I'd built in my head to to reduce the number of options I had to what I thought was real. they were exploded, like those, and i realized oh, like these aren't actually problems in any real sense, because the thing that i'm worried about happening is not something that is worth caring about, because i care about something else, because i know what it is to care about something. uh and I just want to say that the politics, the synthetic politics, like if politics, if politics practice from the heart is about love, which I've tried, and which I think 100% accurate, the heart, the the sense of connection is what drives you to the conclusion that we're all in this together, therefore profit shouldn't exist, capitalism shouldn't exist, there should be no no hierarchy of of exploitation, because the accumulation of of surpluss per a few people is is, it's not just wrong, it's a rational, because you're not, you're you're not part of a different thing, you're part of the same fucking thing, you idiot, you're why are you hoarding this, like you're not separate from it, and so it has to be, it should be defeated, but the synthetic politics, the politics of rationality, stripped of emotion that we practice online, and when I say emotion, that's another word for spirituality, uh, that that secularized politics in the sense of... "We're only operating out of base instinct here, politics is the assumption that we are all separate and we are all out for ourselves and politics is about figuring out the best way to do that, and the difference in that frame is the republicans say, we're all uh, competition is the only way to sort deserving from the undeserving, the democrat, the liberal says, there's no such thing as deserving and undeserving, uh, but capitalism is still necessary because we're all." separated from one another, and in order to accept to extend like the idea of rights to all, which includes property, it has to, then we all have to operate from personal base instinct, but that base instinct will lead us to cooperate with one another cuz it's more efficient that way, that argument is sterile and it leads towards where we are, which is two two politics, to dueling politics of sadism, of hate, because we see lives at totally restrained in lives and and futures that will only be more miserable than the present, but will only be worse. this is the first time i think in in modern history when the current people living have no expectation that the future will even be worth living in. how that's unprecedented? and what it leads to, if that's assumed, because remember, you need to have a grounded spiritual politics to overturn this arrangement, and if we assume as everyone who is operating within this realm does, no, that moment is passed, this is all we have, then then we are in fact on a course for doom, whether you're conservative or a liberal, whether you're reactionary or progressive, whether you think that humankind is inherently evil or that it's good, whether you think that the distribution of resources along class lines is is the uh is virtuous, it's it's it's a divine inspired thing uh, or you think that it is uh wrong and it's the... byproduct of the evil of the human heart, uh, no matter how you slice it, politics cannot resolve to anything other than degradation from where we are now, and therefore, all we can really do, is a sign blame and offer punishment, if politics is collective action and no good action can be taken, only bad action can be taken, and we want the bad action to be taken against the people that we hate, and that is what the asshole pussy party is going to be about, that's what that politics is going to be dominated by, it's already, we've already seen it coming into stream, and the reason I think in the long run, like all this shit, all this dance, angels dancing on the hit of a fucking. pen bullshit about oh the PMC is it a real class and well is the are liberals uh actually a cultural elite and uh what's what and is it college what is well there are plenty of people who go to college who aren't wealthy and what about what that's all of that is secondary the only reason any of that matters is to answer the question well what happens what is like why are we arguing these points if not to figure out what is going to happen so we can intervene with it the point is not to post it is to change the world as some people have said so what that's the only salient element to this point, and to me, the salient point about the college, no college divide that's going to come and over to become and define the parties is that it is going to over the long run help the republicans and help the most socially reactionary version of punitive neoliberalism, because if voting is going to be voting to punish your enemy. whose enemies are more people, both went to college and who didn't go to college going to want to punish, and I think that in a culture where we have these lurid, ostentatious displays of completely removed and villy insensitive cultural decadents, uh, are fucking 500 streaming services and Hollywood movies and then a culture of celebrity and and and glamor, well everyone is miserable, the fact that everyone within that structure... is essentially a democrat and we'll tell you so, that is a visible person to hate in this system. who are you supposed to hate for the democrats? you're not even supposed to hate anybody if you're a liberal democrat, but even on the left, are you supposed to hate? billionaires, who knows a billionaire? how often do you interact with the billionaire? how often do you see a billionaire on tv or in a movie? how hell billionaires don't tell you to vote for? the media telling you how horrible it is, and defending it to you, saying, oh yeah, all this terrible stuff is actually good. lying to your face, pissing in your face and telling you it's raining, they're all liberals, the Trump presidency proved that, they're all fucking liberals, they all want to talk rushia gate for fucking four years and now, oh the election, there's no corruption there, it's like, yeah, you might say, that's because they practice, you know all these these institutional values, guess what, these institutional values over time will be coded more and more as liberal, right now, like half of it is, but going to get pushed, even of the billionaires, the most visible ones, the ones people most know about, because they spend so much of their time on their platforms, on tiktok, on twitter, on facebook, on google, they're all liberals too, and the funny thing is is in that case, it's not because they're part of some fucking cultural uh marxist conspiracy, it's because we're talking about a situation where liberal values come to income everything within the structure, because that is what separates it from pure totalitarian authoritarianism, is the illusion of deliberation through structures like politics, like culture, so over time as as actual life gets more and more thread bear, those institutions that are supposed to legitimize it are going to become more and more illegitimate and more and more associated with democrats, because the thing that generates them at a cultural superstructural level is the experience of college and the attendance of it, and and so these tech ceos adhered to the notion of uh of open debate right, the idea that we're a platform, we're a platform, we're not here to to publish speech, we're only here to, they do that because they don't want to get sued, because if they were a publisher they would be liable for the shit people did on their fucking platform, they can't do that, so they have a vested financial interest in adhering to this liberal nostrum, but then within it there are other liberal. which tell you that certain political expressions are bad for business and you're going to want to remove them, and that means that you're just telling more and more people that you exist to support the the appearance of this fraudulent status quo, which the culture exists to perpetuate, which it's not because it's in charge, it's because it's in charge of the... appearance of forward of of deliberation and of process and of practice. it's happening anyway, the engine is driving us to where we are, the engine of profit struggling against the declining rate of profit, is driving us towards this full uh hyper imiseration and exploitation of everyone starting at the bottom and then going upward, just squeezing uh uh the life out of people. and as it does that, it's cultural representation is going to become more and more associated with democrats and the left war broadly, because those are the people people are going to see, those are the people they're going to interact with in their culture, on their online, in their media, the bad guys of the left are hidden, they're behind the scenes, because their critique of who's responsible is more accurate, but it's still limited by this liberal framework. that because it's all within the capitalist structure, and so that is why over time, I think more and more people, including working class people, including people who are directly impacted by republican policies are going to vote to punish those or own or drag or whatever, those who they most are uh associate with the misery of their lives, and that will be these superstructural uh uh figures, and that means that they'll vote Republican, and they'll vote to help just eventually extinguish culture completely uh, and replace it with the bare coersion of a mechanized post-fascism. oh my throat is quite uh, i got to get another drink, i don't have any more um white clothes though, how in america be different if reconstruction wasn't fucked up, oh boy, well how long do you have uh, i've actually thought about this, um, so i just read a book, an interesting book, i love counterfactual history, as y'all know uh, and somebody wrote a book that is Philip Cundee for zero books and it's called Lenin Lives and the premise is what if Leend hadn't died and it's a 100-year retrospective of what would have happened if the Soviet Union if essentially the premise is what if the Soviet Revolution had had it fact hooked up with the German revolution and created a like a a and hooked up the... cultural bakwater of Russia with the industrial dynamo of Germany, what would that have done? And uh, it's you, it's interesting, it's pretty idiosyncratic, uh, a lot of it is score settling with intellectuals and political figures, the guy doesn't like, but it's definitely interesting, it's someone who loves uh contrafactual stuff, it was fun to read, but it made me think that I kind of want to write something called Lincoln lives, because I do in like the foggiest regions of my brain, an entire region of the country, destroyed and occupied by troops, like turned into clay for movement, clay for shaping in a in a situation where Lincon's powers in this moment are are at a point where he does occupy a folkrum in in American and world history, like he is he is uniquely uh free to move in a way that very few historical actors are because of how fluid the situation he was in control of was. he commanded by his ver mere order a a what million man army that had military domination and the and had annihilated the infrastructure of its defeated southern tier and a congress filled to the brim with radical republicans insisting upon a a land massive land redistribution and a political disinf'. far more than Johnson would have been much more concerned about making sure that there was no malice that befell x- slaves rather than x-confederats, and if that is the case, and as i have said explicitly, if it is connected to land redistribution to white farmers as well in the south, that's the huge thing, because there was there were attempts in the 1890s and 1880. among populists to try to create transracial uh uh connections and that that was what brought the real boot of Jim Crow down I believe uh Henry Steel Commenger has a book about that the strange case of Jim Crow where the thesis is that Jim Crow the Jim Crow laws were a direct response to uh populist attempts to create uh interracial so if you wouldn't have had that, if you would have been able to connect cut the connection, the social connection between small holding white farmers and the plantation elite, reoriented their politics, turn them into republicans, you you decapitate, you internally decapitate that. rode of like the capitalist uh productive economy of the United States. now the thing is, Lincoln would have at every level been incredibly, you know, it would have been pressured and and and pushed away away from that by northern capital, which was at an unprecedented degree of power following the concentration of capital that happened over the course of the civil war, and that really is what jump started America's industrial economy. the same thing happened by the way. in uh England, the thing, obviously the industrial revolution in England was in full swing by the turn of the 19th century, but it was the Napoleonic wars that led to the hyper, like the next stage of uh of English capitalism to emerge. Similar thing happened in the United States after civil war, but those productive forces could have been politically channeled, the the forces existed between the ex slaves of the south. the uh former small holders of the south uh and the union fucking army which compose the working class and like yomenry of the entire northern tier and it their politic and their family members uh in in the in the northern states the thing the main thing he would have contended with and the main thing they might have pulled us towards something worse is that back door that open drafty back door of land just that that that that diffuser of political tension of politic of uh of of social dis disconntent uh at the end of the day what what the the civil war when it finally did end with the compromise of 1877 it was on the backs of the former slaves it was we have opened this bottle we have opened this genie's bottle of emancipation which you know all all the wigs and the and the immoderates that always said would be unmanageable but because how are you going to get racist white people to live with black people on equal terms? well, since we got the reconstruction we got with the reimposition of ladifundist plantation economies and the reinstitution of of slavery or or I guess just like the ensurfening of former slaves uh and and the and the continued exploitation or uh the continued um uh languishment, the continued languishment of the ex-confederate... military uh rank and file small holders within that framework the decision was made, well we'll essentially recreate the old model uh without the without all of the uh, i guess you poil it down to et all the loud voices, all the rules, all all the dirt and uh and rudeness of channel slavery and replace it with a more refined, more... distracted exploitation through share cropping arrangements and convict leasing, well there look at all the forms here, this is all in order, he owes this much uh this much cotton to uh his former master because he borrowed these many seeds, there this is a legal exchange, this person is working to clear a uh buy you for fucking turpentine mining or something because he committed a crime, he was found to be loitering in the town square, this is all, this is all above board, and that was the liberal revolution, but it could have been pushed further, that's why you know, it was the completion of the blueu revolution. but just like in every revolutionary scenario there is fluidity, it could have been the beginning of something very different. now how far it would have gone? i don't know, i don't think you get a situation where like racial harmony is is uh real in America by the turn of the 19th century, no, but i have, i could see a situation where you have a abolition of dejure, or i'm sorry, yes, you have an abolition of dejure segregation in America across the entire continent, not just in the north. uh you have an abolition of dejure uh segregation by like maybe the 20s, and you know what kind of politics is created by that coalition by the way, what like that republican party, what does that republican party look like? what are the pressures on, especially as industrialization increases, and is the working class self-consciousness comes more and more into fruition, how are the conflicts there fought? when you have a unified multiracial working class rather than a siloed and a racially uh fragmented and mutually um antagonized working classs and then yeah like if you have the end of the dezure apartite by the 20s without buse the thing is the end of our end of dejura com uh our end of deasured apartide in America happened almost simultaneously with the end of American prosperity. That's a thing that gets overlooked when we talk about the backlash, we talk about how white people decided they would rather be racists than have pensions. That wasn't the decision. The decision was, I'd rather be racist and here and maintain some sort of hierarchy where I'm on top of somebody else, then get nothing. because that was what was on offer uh after after that the rearrangement of the economy that happened after the the oil shock of the 70s and and and the the end of the bretton wood system. so if you have an ended dejure segregation in a moment of like, i don't know, a a a socialized a boom of American productivity, considering that it was a massive resource. continent that was maybe over time uh seeing its industrial capacity tamed towards social ends oh my god you have you have a dynamo of potential uh revolution here which is what Markles thought the United States was the dynamo of the next century and they were correct and we were in the tipping point and we tipped the wrong way every time and i would argue that the first big tip and the one that's most mind bending because it because it's the first one it is the most historic contingent one, it is the civil war and reconstruction and the maintenance of the constitutional system, all of which spring from at least partially the lincon assassination, so I was wondering, I might write something about that, I think it might be interesting, yeah, we're getting, we're going to get shit hammered here with some rain coming up, that's why I'm batting the hatches down. free real estate man, it really was the downfall, but I'm imagining like if I was going to write something and I was going to try to like game it out, you know, a situation where after apomatics, the uh, a Lincoln led reconstruction that leads to a, you know, a shaping up of challenge right away, like a a almost immediately the former you, uh, leaders of the confederacy realized that, oh, this is really shit. stake here, like we are going to be disenfranchised, we are going to lose our land, we are going to lose our power, there would have been another flare up of violence, the war wouldn't have ended, just the way it didn't in our real life, but it ended with this insurgent campaign led by the red red shirts and the clan, eventually leading uh to a series of almost basically cows uh and abbregations of democracy across the south which were embedded by the... essentially uh demobilizing, if that fight had happened earlier and been more intense and sharp with the army still out in the field and with the commitment to the cause as its zeneth and the commitment to the cause of emancipation uh at its zen? what do you see? hey, maybe they call in Geribaldi, remember there was that offer by the congressman to have garibaldi come and leave the union army and he said he wouldn't do it unless they made slavery the ending of slavery a war end? well, what if it's 1865 and there has to be another campaign maybe? baldi comes off the bench, maybe marks and Engels come over here or the fucking constoga wagon with a printing press in the back, start organizing among the... uh the the germans of this of course is fun and fancy, but that's the beauty of counterfactual stuff is that it it gets to be fun and I argue that if you pose the questions the right way, it is still useful, because to talk about what didn't happen in 1965 and what could have happened, what was possible given the material realities we had at hand, we can talk about what? could happen now, what if Marx moved to Texas in the 50s? That one could have happened too, the prussians essentially said, we don't want, we want to keep an eye on him, but what if they'd said, good ridens, which they did to a lot of those fucking people. "the thing that bums me out though is that there was a wave of vigilanty violence against anti-slavery German settlers in Texas when the civil war broke out uh there's uh something an incident called the nuensis massacre where a bunch of german immigrants were just strung up by the local confederate authorities those guys love freedom so much they were fighting for so much fucking freedom god the way they would just uh hang people for opinions the way they did a draft before the union did the way they suspended" be a corpus immediately? god, we love him, don't we? i worry they would have fucking uh, they they would have merked him, but then maybe hey, him and engles go out with a bunch of guys and form some sort of gorilla column. engles was a pretty good uh uh military tactician and strategic thinker, they called him the general because it was his favorite like topic, but uh, and he commanded troops during or he, no, he didn't command troops, he was an adjudent for troops with uh villach, my boy, August Villach, was a civil war general. during the 48 revolutions uh he was actually uh reprimanded for during at one of the barricades uh in the Rhineland going around and taking all of the German flags because what the the the the main flag of the German 48 Revolutions was the tricolor of I imagined liberal German republic taking them down and replacing them with red flags but he acquitted himself ably uh he described um he described the... um, he described, he he described the tact strategic situation in the civil war, at the beginning of the civil war, uncanily, he he uh, all two years before they started the marsh to Atlanta, he was telling Marx, yeah, no, they got to go cut it in half this way, why are they going after Richmon, Richmond is meaningless, cut the thing in half, and eventually that's they fucking realized, took him fucking three years to do it, and also described what World War One would look like 30 years earlier with almost uncanny ability so yeah maybe they could become like a a unit in there hey throw everybody in there get all get all the have Haiti it come on like the US recognizes Haiti but then like gives them a bunch of money and has them send a detachment but uh there was there's a angles quote in this book, this Lincon Liv's book that I just Lennon Lives book that I just read that is stunning, I hadn't encountered it before, let's see if I can find it. damn it, this is not going well, but yeah, if we were going to have a Lenin in America, a figure of that sort of pivotal equivalence, it would have been him, because Lenin is the same way, there's no recover revolution if Lenin doesn't show up at the Finland station, I think most people are in agreement with that who study the topic, because the bolcheviks were in the process of resolving themselves. to supporting the provisional government, basically because they were too afraid of the alternative, because they didn't have any confidence in their ability to command the situation or govern if they did. Lenin showing into town, showing up to town and publishing the April theses and shit was a lightning bolt that broke open all of and cut through to a degree and over time and it took a while but it got through that just cut over time through the the uh the the inert the inert in the party um so he's another guy what if he had his uh his a decade earlier, you probably would have had some sort of cornal ask military coo overthrowing the uh provisional government, and then depending on how much resistance to that emerged, some sort of pree fafascist anti-semitic, like industrial program, that's what Tratssky said, and I agree with him on that point, which is why it's stupid to get mad. at the bolschevics or or uh or condem them for doing the revolution, I mean there's plenty of points where they made the wrong moves after that, but they they were doing the only thing they could have done, and their their gamble that they were going to spark a world revolution, it was not a miscalculation, that was the moment, that was the moment, and it was the Germans more than anybody you dropped the fucking ball, and it was because the they had been too developed, the the the... socialist movement had been too captured by the superstructure in a way that Marx didn't anticipate. Oh, this is the quote I was looking for, so uh, so in 1887, this is what marks, this is what Engels said about what was going to happen if the brinksmanship between the empires of Europe wasn't ended. No war is any longer possible for Prussia, Germany except a world war, and a world war indeed of... extent and violence hitherto unddreampt of eight to 10 millions of soldiers will massacre one another and in doing so devower the whole of Europe until they have stripped it bareer than any swarm of locus has ever done. the devastations of the 30 years war compressed into three or four years and spread over the whole continent. famin, pestilence, general demoralization both of the armies and of the mass of the people produced by acute distress, hopeless confusion of our artificial machinery and trade, industry and... credit, ending in general bankrupcy, collapse of the old states and their traditional state wisdom to such an extent that crowns will roll by dozens on the pavement and there will be nobody to pick them up. absolute impossibility of seeing how it will end and who will come out of the struggle as victor, only one result is absolutely certain: general exhaustion and the establishment of the conditions for the ultimate victory of the working class, and he was 100% correct, because the ultimate conditions for the victory of the working class were: the Russian revolution and then the German revolution, but the the the the German working class was led by people who were no longer working class, and you might want to say, aha, so that's just like the PMC now, no, because that was an actual working class movement, are we are post that, we are in the post, we are the post, we are in the shadow of the defeat, we are in the shadow of the defeat of the 18 of of the world war, buse imagine if and more socialist America encounters a world revolution starting in Russia and being kicked off across Europe. Imagine a world where the United States has say like a president Eugene Debbs during World War II, instead of prisoner Eugene Debbs and President Wood Wilson. How do they respond to that? Do they send troops to Archangel to allie with a bunch of fucking uh uh Genicidaires and and mystic psychos and and and Martinets. probably not, but we missed the moment, and now we are in the post political, that superstructural capture that started with the rule, the leaders of the SDP, your guys like your eberts, you're naskies, now it's everywhere, it's universe. in America anyway, we are all that, we are all nasky, we are all ebert, no matter what we think, no matter how much we think that we're fucking Rose of Luxembourg, I'm sorry, we're all Nasky, but the difference, but the thing is is that all of that, all of that upward trending, um, striving that drove the leaders of the German Social Democrats towards accommodation when they needed to strike against capital, because it was the moment. it was the resolving moment, they were uh, that doesn't exist anymore, there's no hope that anybody's getting any sugar cubes, there's only misery, and when we break away, enough of us break away from this phantom pantamime of politics and re reforge human connections, i think we will be able to sideestep all of that and come orthagonal to the the asified superstructure and shatter. or we won't, and we will have a common ruin of the contending classes, which is what happened in Nazi Germany, that was the common ruin of the contending classes, 1945. I said orthagonal, oh or no, I'm that's how I pronounce it, I'm not gonna say orthag, orthagonal, fuck you, orthagonal, fuck off. Yeah, like those are two, those are two, you know, in the plinko board of western civilization and world civilization as we you know move towards the intensification of history uh as as our technology accelerates change, some big plinko board moments were linked assassination, boop and the failure of the of the German revolution really more than anything. Yeah, I am a midwesterner, I'm gonna say orthagonal. What other way to say orthagonal is there though? Never mind, you're you're typing, you couldn't do it if you wanted to, that's silly, that's silly. i i call it the plinqueto board not the plinko board because i watched way more uh best of the worst than i have fucking prices right these guys are giving me the business i know what orthagonal is orthagonal is coming in a perfect angle and also right angle and also the club that uh nixon founded uh at witdier college after he got rejected by the franklins i'm just talking about how to pronounce it, orthogonal, orthogonal, oh, orthogonal, orthogonal, i get it, thanks, that's how will would say it, orthogonal, but that's not me, baby, the end of the day, i am truly uh a a middle europan bog peasant, i am a where edited hick at the end of the day. Bye guys.
