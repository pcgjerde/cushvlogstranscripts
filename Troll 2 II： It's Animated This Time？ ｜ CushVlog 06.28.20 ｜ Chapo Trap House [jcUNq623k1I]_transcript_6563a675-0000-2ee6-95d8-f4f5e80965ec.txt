 Hello, if you'll notice I'm at a new angle, it's because our producer Chris finally brought over his telescopic articulated phone holder, so now we can do kind of more face to face as opposed to the weird downward angle. sort of pov pov porn angle i was using uh, but what this really means is that now it will be much easier for me to do another grilling stream because the first time the reason i kind of decided i don't want to do this anymore is because it was too hard to pay attention to where the camera was keep it up and what was going on in the grill but and yeah i drop it all the time too so now i've got the fence over here i'm going to post it up on the fence i'll get a nice bird's eye view of my head and the grill and we can just go through a hole, we'll do a little grill and chill some sometime this week, so I was doing what I usually do when I'm alone, and I was thinking about the monitor and the miramac, for those of you who don't know what that was, it was uh, the most famous naval battle of the civil war. uh, which doesn't have a lot of great naval battles in it, mostly running bloccade, running a like fleets running uh through like fort systems like New Orleans or mobile, damn the torpedoes full steam ahead, uh, there wasn't a lot of you know like broadside on broadside because the union had such overwhelming naval superiority, so what that meant was that the confederacy kept trying to find uh technological work around force multipliers to make up for the fact that they had so fewer ships, so many fewer ships, and so they did very innovative things like they built a fucking submarine, the uh CSS Hunley, which was designed to be able to go underwater to a blockade ship, attach a naval mine and then leave uh and blow up the ship uh, and they tried it and they successfully blew up. and sank a Union bloccade ship but at the cost of the entire uh boat crew so if those guys had had the if those confederates had had the faith of like an ISIS recruit they might have actually been able to keep doing that if they've been able to find 12 guys ready to turn the crank and blow up in exchange for what? i mean it was a good trade one it was like 12 guys in in a little metal uh turd blew up a ship that brought the around what like 300 uh yankey sailors and completely took out of commission, a ship of line and so the other thing they did is they experimented with putting metal iron on the sides of the ships so that the damn cannons would stop just staving in the planks of the wood and sinking the ships and what that led to to do was they uh when they seized I believe it was uh Newport News in Virginia there was a US ship that was abandoned by the uh by the naval um that was abandoned by the US Navy as the the confederacy came closer and it was called the USS Marimac and what they did is they covered it with slanting iron clad clatding that was designed to be able to absorb the blow of a artillery piece and then hopefully have it riche offered so the thing when it was a water, a boat looked like just sort of a trapesoid with guns come poken out of it, there was you couldn't really, there were no crew members, it was all under behind, and of course this time us navy ships and confederate navy ships, all navy ships kind of looked vaguely like master and commander, open deck. uh wooden sides and wooden keel or whatever and uh folksels and such and uh gunnels, all that's wood and then the masks. and you know the cannons underneath the deck, this is totally unlike that, and so it rolled up, it it steamed up to uh the mouth of the James River in Hampton Roads, Virginia, where there were a bunch of US ships, uh, observing the uh blockade of the southern ports and southern waterways to keep them from getting selling uh cotton in Europe and getting supplies and money and stuff from Europe. or anywhere else and the ship rose up looking like this weird metal block floating in the water, couldn't even see the crew, like it didn't even look like it was being manned by people, and remember this is the time when you know there wasn't a people didn't interact with the mechanical reality very often, there was there was obviously uh, there were obviously trains, but train travel was still relative. rare, people mostly travel by Shanks mair or by horse, so this ship rolls up and starts shooting at him, blowing holes into these uh boats, and they fire back, but everything just glancess off of them, and they sink a ship and they they they disable another one on the show on the on the on the uh, another one while trying to escape runs the ground on a sandbar. but they're out of ammo, they're going to come back the next day, finish her off, so imagine your crew on that boat, crew on that ship, waiting a sitting duck to get annihilated by this monstrosity, this thing that looks like it's coming out of a different world, and then the next morning, can you imagine trying to sleep, the light comes up on Hampton road and there's the the the marimac, but then in between you and the marimac is this weird little floating teard drop plank like thing, this metal eye almost shaped with a little little metal box on top of that, much smaller than the metal box and much lower and closer to the waterline, just poking out like the hump of a of a of a of a killer of a humpback whale or something, and so now you got to be thinking, well what the fuck is this, where did? this thing come from, i mean you've already seen the the marimac, obviously the doors of perception are opening a little bit, you're now where more things are possible on this earth that you had thought baby, but now this thing what the fuck, it didn't even look like a boat that everyone call the classic uh description was cheese box on a raft and of course modern readers you see that and they go, what the fuck is a cheese box, well cheese used to come in boxes, okay they didn't have plastic packaging for things. and you weren't just going to have like you're not going to just take cheese off the floor like off a shelf hold in your hand so it came in a little box and that little one little cannon poking out a little slip and I'm sure you're holding your breath and then it moves out to meet the marimac and then it starts shooting at it and they spend the day just blasting cannon shells off of one another in a way in a way that no. no contemporary wooden warship would be able to take, and at the end of it uh, there was an explosion in the in the in the uh, the gun site of the of the monitor and it had to withdraw, but the maramac was out of out of fucking ammo anyway and it had to withdraw and they saved the boat, they saved the the they saved the the union bloccade ship that had been uh run a ground and i just think about that something. times, i think about witnessing that either on one of the other ships in the in the Hampton Roads or from the land, because there were people there, somebody on on on twitter said it must have been something like seeing a kajju fight like hiju battle and uh like there had to have had some there had to it had to have felt other worldly, it had to have felt like there had to have been some notion of anyone involved in that moment. that something was shifting, that they were entering a new world, and i think about how like those moments have been so hypernormalized that now we don't even notice them, you know, like we we, anyone who's alive now has seen something on the psychially disorienting level of what? every couple of years probably, but there's just so damn. of them but yeah cuz I think it's hard to find another moment that disorienting because I mean you already in a civil war for god's sake so so the ground was clearly unstable beneath your feet but they have that kind of thing burst in the middle of it somebody I saw a paint picture painting that uh uh someone the Japanese like silk artisan or like the silk or the silk screens or whatever they did like to commemorate historical events and I saw one of uh of the of the black of Matthew Perry's black fleet the that op that by force opened Tokyo to western trade in the 1860s and the it's it's it's a Japanese style of wood printer whatever and it's got the Japanese looking guys with the Kimonos and the samurai swords looking out. water and then just a big black trapezoid looking thing, no people, no no it's like you see this this rolling hill and these these flowingly robed figures and the and the ocean with the unddulating tide and then these brutal angles and this unnatural black, it's got to felt like that. I guess what I what I think about that is I just sort of, I guess I envy being in a position where those sort of things aren't already predigested, you know what I mean, like I feel like as insane as everything has been in the 21st century, and they've just been getting more insane by like the by the exponential late almost, none of them really except maybe 911 have felt. in the moment like they were uh uprooting anything, this gets to what Felix says, the idea that everything keeps getting worse, everything's the wor, everything's the same, but it's getting worse, everything's shitty but just getting slowly worse, even though it's the same, what he's describing is that sense of having everything assimilated instantly by our our our awareness of the hyper moment that we're living in, our consciousness of the the the flow of the slipperness of reality. is such that things can't really throw us that way because we are instantly assimilating them into our understanding of how the world works. these things just become instantly part of our understanding. in fact, we instantly, as soon as we hear about them, our brain goes overboard to convince ourself, well of course this is going to happen, and anyone who is surprised by it, wow, what's wrong with you? you didn't see this coming, well, I guess some people weren't paying attention. and i just like the idea of just being able to stand there on a sand dune and just watch something that happened on earth and know that you're the first person to ever see it to see that. i guess at this point you wouldn't want to get that feeling because it would have to be such a tremendous break that you probably couldn't handle it. and this is the thing i keep thinking about with the internet. like i think i i said on here a while ago uh you know we all just assume mk ultra stopped because they got bored with it or the results were inconclusive it just they ran out of experiments and they were never able to do repeatable thing to create anything that could be useful out of it and that's just what we assume because all the information we ever found out about mk ulture was on the CIA's terms the initial the initial the majority of the documents were destroyed. We only know about MK Olture because documents in an auxiliary warehouse were un accidentally uncovered years later. I mean, that doesn't inspire a lot of confidence that we can really say for sure we know what the progress of and what the findings of Mculture were, and when you think about things like uh, the Manson murders and and Tom O'Neal's book, which is really really interesting and offers some tanalizing connections between MK Ultra and the Manson murders. and also little uh and among the things he finds, among the things he found was a letter from Dr. jolly west who is like the fucking uh uh he is the uh forest gump of MK Ultra and that he's there for all like the nastiest shit in the like he's it's he's him and he he answered directly to dr Sydney Gott who was the the chief necromancer at the CIA and he's and and at one point and this was after a very odd mysterious child murder had occurred at the army base where West was uh stationed uh and which she participated in in interviewing the uh suspect who claims to not have no memory of uh committing the murder but who ended up confessing after talking to west. West also talked to uh to Jack Ruby in his jail cell uh and after he talked to West he was never coherent again in any other interviews. But he wrote a letter to Sydney Gottlieb the Tom O'Neal found where he expressedly says I have discovered a way to make people do things that they wouldn't otherwise do, he says it, and then when you realize and then when you find out that he was also occupying real estate at the Hade Ashberry free clinic where Manson, well Manson was there in San Francisco in the summer of love, and where he was seen and where he took members of the family on a daily basis, I mean it's circumstantial, but it's something, it's something we're thinking about, and the thing it makes me think about it. is what did mk ultra turn into? and you know you want to get you want to get baroke and you want to get high modernist, you could say, oh, they're like pumping it into the water supply or chem trails and we're all getting like a synthetic, we're all getting like a propaganda dose of of broadcast media that is then we're made more receptive to by a perfect uh, a perfect recipe of psychopharmacological ingredients that long research in mk al laboratory. is in in uh field experiments like Manson, like uh, Frank Olson, like maybe Jonestown, like that city, that town in France in the early 60s, that is suspected to have been dosed entirely, an entire town in France has for years been assumed to have been dosed by asset by unknown people, and now recently, there's a new CIA document on earth where they talked about field experiments. I mean they did those failed controlled experiments like midnight climax where they had uh sex workers dose their clients and filmed what happened uh and tried or tried to like pump it in aerosolized into a party this is uh this is like with the sign statistically significant sample size of people uh and like that's why I think that that's a as good an explanation for as any for things like the moth man uh like when you look at the wild multiplicity of uh of things that people in and around point pleasant west Virginia said they saw in 1966 and 67, it's not impossible to imagine that that was some sort of experiment and this time not just giving them as it and see what happens, but giving them as it and then giving them a specific uh stimulus and seeing how they responded to it, see if there was any sort of group cohesion around certain explanations, like if they became susceptible to certain intreaties, so you got a CIA guy with a fucking like a hell, it could be a helicopter or or or a frog man suit uh and you you give the town enough LSD and then you see what happens, but yeah so if you want to go high-modernist you'd say that, but I would say you want to get digital with it, you want to get you want to get 21st century, if the fucking internet is is the is the acid of the current mk ultra variant if there is one. the I mean it's it's not like you have to pull the strings too hard to find the connection, I mean the entire internet was a darpa project, it was a defense department pursuit. I mean, yes, we get a lot of stuff, coursey of military, military uh, in fact, most stuff we got in terms of big technological breakthroughs, through intensive military investment uh that get then gets turned into commercial use, but uh, I don't think we can assume that that's the only reason that uh, that the internet was pursued, like, oh, accidentally creaved the internet, we just wanted to send uh missile plans to each other, just when you see what the internet is done in terms of creating an entire new plane of existence, I don't think it's too much to say, a new plane for human existence, a new place, a new... no dimension for humans to place their anima, to place their human essence, to put their spirit, their emotions, their soul, their ideologies, their jussons, they're geist, they're numina, where they want to cram it, and they can put it there it is, it's it has the same. truly catholic and that it it is perceived as a platform and not an actual uh uh framework like it's just it's just a thing for you to have fun on as opposed to a fully realized social space determined by capitalism and by uh the state that watch guards capitalism in which we're allowed to play out our desires which are of course totally shaped by the market. uh and and where we can we can substitute human action and human communication and human organization. now of course that doesn't mean that people should absolutely shun the internet, i mean acid which the CIA essentially introduced to the United States in order to see how it could help make people tractable and and you could argue that the acid influence on the American counterculture was negative in that it moved it alienated people away from the sort of uh militant solidarity that you would need for an effective uh a political movement in in favor of individualized like soul searching but it also had i think uh positive effects i know personally in my life it has uh and so you take the good with the bad, but I don't think it's anything to anything necessarily too far to just keep in mind that these structures are allowed to exist the way they are for a reason, and when you have a straight line of like of of of the the militarization undergarding the internet, like it's it's it's existence is an outgrowth of the military. very uh cansian state, i think that's a good reminder, you know, it's a good way to keep yourself from logging too much on is to know like this is the enemy's domain, you are you are pilgrims in a unholy land and there's a total chance that like the forces they're unleashing here are beyond the the ones that they can control and that's certainly true of as like if i was if i if i wanted to do an artistic uh thing about the moth man the whole point was that there would no be no explanation there would be interlocking narratives that would conflict with one another and reinforce one another but none of which would be uh would be privileged or validated but one of the ones would be yeah starts as a CIA dosing this town, but then the their collective will to believe essentially creates a real mov man, like a tolpa, a psychic manifestation of this town, of of essentially of the cold war, because pleasant was built uh next to an underground munitions lab that was one of the big uh post-war or early 20th century employers of the areas. made dynamite for the military, the awareness of of of uh global bringsmanship and nuclear a nuclear war and the sort of the doom cycle of of military uh uh build up, they all had that, they're all tweaking that at some psychic level, even if they were aware of it, and then they get dose by acid by their own government to protect them from the Russians and give them a boogie man, what if they made it real? but it's actually the manifestation of the very state that they uh owe their prosperity to, the dark side, the unspoken, uh, the shadow figure of the virtuous yoman republic that we thought we lived in, or that we think we live inconsciously, or at least back then they did, probably in west Virginia, who knows? see, someone says, will q become real in the same way, I mean q, you could already argue the Q has been made real, i i am of the opinion that the first queue post was probably a joke by an irony person, and then the initial batch of proofs were by some uh hustling right-wing uh forum dweller who figured out that they could make money from the back end by interpreting Q, I mean there is there was apparently a video - of one of these people accidentally logging on to q using the q name back when they were still putting q uh proofs out and then they quickly realized they were on camera and turn it off and that's se is very plausible, but like most of the stuff that we now think of is q cannon was not in any of the proofs, like the stuff about JFK, that's none of that is is q, that's that's a q splinder, that's that's uh, that's gnostics of the queue, and now you've got q members of q believers are going to be in congress in the next session, imagine they become an actual faction. uh and they get and there's some member of uh like the intelligence community who wants enough of their power that he feels safe to come out could be a whistleblower and go in front of congress and claim to be q and and denounce the deep state at that point can you say that he isn't? i'm trying to think of some of the other good uh Q uh gnostic gospels, things that were pulled out of someone's ass and then everyone decided were were uh, i think that think that all the shit about Tom Hanks, i think is not from Q because i don't think you's dropped a proof in a year, but they're still out there and it's totally self-propelling now, they're not even responding to the initial uh signal anymore, like once the that's the difference. between the difference between a cult, the real difference between a cult and a religion is that the the prophet, the fountain head, either the deity or the the representative of the day or the wise man who founded it is still alive, it's a cult, he's dead and this thing is still around, then it's a religion, if it survives beyond the uh the the immediate charisma of its founder, then it's durable enough to be a religion, and i'd say because it's been so long since q is actually posted at this point given the speed of inner. that he's effectively dead and still around, so that means it's not our religion, because these people are all now operating off of their own stuff, like the bible has been written, now they're doing new stuff, now they're doing commentaries, now they're writing their own versions of city of god, the suma theologica, the writing the writing their own vulgates. they're writing their own uh their own dead sea scrolls because at the end of the day what q does is accu provides a psychic balm to the cognitive dissonance of living in a country that you love deeply and that it treats you like shit and it sucks and it's awful and is terrible and bad and the thing is everybody's got to deal with some way, the the healthy way is to say, maybe this country isn't that great, maybe it isn't being run for my interest, not for the interest of some global cabal, but but by the interest of the richest people in the country, but if you have certain ideological matrix that thought will never occur to you, and so you have to do mental gymnastics to imagine some, some American mandy showing up to write all the wrong. and put all of the evil people away and validate your your suffering, your imagine suffering buse most of these people are not really suffering, but the less you suffer, the more slights hurt, because it's all you feel, so they're they're miserable, they're in deep agony uh, because of the country's failure to comport with their vision of it, and they fill in the gap with Q, like all the things that you see, all the public evil is mirrored by see. which is of course the opposite of what really all any kind of public good is mirrored by a deeper and more systematically uh a more systematically influential evil and so yeah there's they're nuking all the underground uh layers and uh, yeah, one day they will emerge to to to judge the righteous and the guilty, and if your name was written in the book of queue, you shall have eternal life, I mean it's just, it's it's just like you could argue that it's like the third, it's like a great awakening type thing, it's like the third grade awakening, it's it's like you could, you could cycle starting like maybe in the 70s at the beginning of the moral majority, you could all, you could track this whole revivification of... the their vision of God is is is is their is uh is trump, their vision of heaven is the villages or sugarland texas, creating a material comfort to live now, that's actually the pursuit of get heaven, and and you can call this like the third grade awakening, but like it's a uh, it's it's a deeper, it's a deeper sleep really, but it is a... of a new form of protestantism that is shaken all of its uh spiritual fetters and become a total worship of the self and of the self's uh material reward, material satisfaction, it's it's essentially headenism, no, i mean i'm sure they'd be mad if i told them they don't believe in god, but they 100% don't believe in? god, they think that heaven is like their fucking backyard barbecue, and that only makes sense if you do not have a spiritual dimension, as in you do not imagine, if you do not if you cannot extend like your imagination to a plane beyond this one, that's the only way any notions of heaven or the sublime or god or oneness or unity or anything makes sense is if there is another dimension of... perception and they don't have that, so it's not, it's not, it's not a religion, it's not a spiritual pursuit, it's desacralized, and the thing is is that that's it's evangelical christianity, but it's basically true of most christians, like most catholics are like that now, most everybody is, because secularization doesn't just affect your uh secular institutions, it affects religious institutions as well. you're substituting at every level material convenience and pleasure for any kind of social good, then what room is there for a spirit? I mean, we have defined, we have defined life as as the accumulation of individual, physical and emotional pleasure, and you can say that's not true, but that's that is how we have defined life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, all that, all that abstract shit, they could mean anything really given the different. social context in this specific social context has come down to us now as as it must is we're the we're the consumer of last resort for god sakes of course this is our ideology this country exists to consume that is the world of America in the world system is to consume be at the end of the line and eat the fucking leftovers and so that's why we have instead of having work worker control at uh because it is it's genuinely true Americans have more wealth and Americans make more money than Europeans do by a significant amount, and they get instead the big long vacations, you know, and healthcare, and you can say, well, it's not, we didn't choose this, and it's it's complicated, but at a certain level, because we're still all living this way, and we're still all, we're not in revolt, we've accepted the logic of it at some level, because we acted out, even if we don't like it, we acted out, we accept the logic, that it is, consumption is the sum total of human pursuit. No, no spirituality can survive that, no no kind of spirituality can survive - a world where that's the where that's the case, and that is why socialism is is dead and why it's everyone's just breaking their fucking arms trying to get some fucking volts into the cadaver. because socialism imagines as a baseline a social order where values other than consumption have been brought in, where they have been where where where consumption is balanced, and Americans have a very hard time even conceiving of that, because they only see it as losing what they have, because the gains are theoretical and they're social and they're intangible, so people... don't want to give it up, and that's why as I said the other on the last stream, I think it was, there's this tendency of of people on the left to insist, I got to bring my ball, I got to bring my my. whatever my personal uh system for sucker and uh and and pain alleviation is my opiot, which usually ends up being some sort of consumer desire because that's the country we live in, i need to bring that along with me, no deal, but we're trying to build something where that wouldn't be necessary, yeah, but i don't know that, i don't want, i don't want to, it's part of my identity now, and if i if i give it up then i'm not going to be in charge of... the new world and and people like me are going to be discriminated against, even though we're defining, we're talking about something that by definition wouldn't exist, so people wouldn't be oppressed because it would not be uh, it wouldn't even be a consideration, we need to go back to Hagel, that is correct. I got to say guys, the guy knew what he was, I mean, he's you gotta, you gotta like it is really Marks and Hegel, I mean in practical political terms, political economic terms, marx is where you start, Hegel is it's more abstract, but like if if uh, if if Marx turned Hegel on its head, well then by definition, Hegel is the other side, it's the it's the feet or whatever the fuck, it's one thing and two sides of it, they're both true. and his description of of the of this of uh his notion of humanity as a being coming into consciousness of itself as a species, the way that a mind comes into consciousness of itself as an individual, i think that's the only way to understand uh, it's the only way to put give meaning to to all this dialectical clockwork. we can describe, it's the only way to impart real meaning to it, to have it mean anything more than just the bare description of it of the facts of it, it's it's the ghost in the machine, bring back the prussian empire, god no, see that's that's why he started to try to talk politics and it's like, okay, see now, this is where Carl takes over, because no, the highest highest uh development of human relations is not the fucking prussian empire considering that they uh they they they had a chance to take over the world there for a bit and they really kind of didn't do a great job yeah no like i said the other day fucking the prussians the prussians are fucking assholes and speaking of Walter Sheidle uh and his his idea of of uh you know Europe being kind of separate in development uh than the rest of the world due to its lack of proximity to uh to horse archery in the step and that's shaping the cultures. Germany is another good example uh prussians uh or the descendent the prussian aristocracy anyway the... junkers of prussia were the descendants of the tetonic knights who uh settled that region uh in the uh the northern crusade against the the old uh the old balts the the the the last pagan remnant in continental Europe uh west of the uh perals i guess and so it was like a military aristocracy like and uh and they descended along those lines. whereas the party Germans of uh Bavaria kind of nestled in the middle there near Switzerland, not bothering anybody, not didn't even really have to worry about the ottamans, Austria had to worry about the ottamans and that's why those guys have such huge sticks up their assets, but but in the like that Rhine area it's just giant casks of goost demenor and all of the encased meats you can handle, what's not the like, the Hollen zolern though, that's one. the better, i like the holen solars a lot, uh, uh, i also like the the ruling house of Bavaria, that ruled way longer than the Hapsburgs, uh, the widdle's box, it's a good one. somebody's mad about uh me saying that they settled the baltic, well there's a lot of lutheran german aristocrats in lithuania, how'd they get there? yes, yes, battle of the ice. Alexander Nevski, but come on, they they took over a bunch of that area, the electoral makeup of Yymart Germany. uh, even though naziism started in Bavaria, that was never the heartland of their electoral power, because all the German parts of uh, all the catholic parts of Germany, the most popular party was the center party, which was an explicit cap catholic party that attempted to do its own sort of thirdway catholic thing of like being critical uh like uh capitalism but still being traditional and all that sort of jk chester. Tonian uh, it was, it was the lower middle classes, and uh, and farmers, the small holding peasantry, the our beloved sack of uh, sourcrout, I guess sacks of sourcrout, yes, the PMC did, we're we're the we're the we're the party. as always are the party of fascism, that's why i wanted i want, i'm glad that was brought up though, because i wanted to say something about fascism, um, there's been obviously very heated debate over the last few years about like what counts as fascism and specifically what counts about what counts as fascism about the current moment right? is trump a fascist uh are the'? are the cops fascist is, what does it mean? does it just mean right-wing authoritarianism or is it more specific? if it's too specific then it just becomes a historical descriptor that has no contemporary meeting at all. and then of course there's a practical argument, which is well, if you've got this the the if if all of your democratic nicities have been destroyed and you are now, a a being directly suborned to capitalism's jack boot, isn't that doesn't it? not matter what you want to call it, doesn't that mean that's fascism, if we think of fascism as like the ultimate abrigation of civil society uh, and i would say that that's it's worth pointing out the distinctions and cheesing out the meaning uh for one reason and that is that regardless of what people are operating from in their head when they imagine fascism, the description of it that they're operating from uh when they're imaging. existing order. representing a a specific national bourgeois collection of of capitalist uh and then you have a rising and radical and militant left organizing in and outside of the democratic processes that existed and then fascism filled the gap, protected the the the order, the state and uh the class interest that the state represented from this mass with its own mass movement, different composition, more middle class, more worral, but similarly mobilized, similarly able to fight in the streets to control and dominate the political zones, and they were brought to power by those embattled old powers as a way to protect them, but the very mobilization and effectiveness of fascism at combined workers like in socialism transferred over to, small shop owners or whoever, students, but then also with the support and aid of the richest people in the society, which left wings certainly didn't have, but that put them in a position where they were able to essentially absorb the state. because they were more at that point the party became more powerful than the state that had summoned it to its protection and so it absorbed it and brought it to its own ens. "that is not possible in the current moment, that can't happen, because Americans, and specifically conservative Americans, right-wingers, the people who you would, the petty bourgeois, specifically of right-wingers, the people most likely to make up a social basis for fascism, are simply too demobilize to ever fill the gap that way. I mean, yes, the left isn't as scary or organized as it used to be. but it's certainly getting militant in a way that's making it harder to conduct business and meet but what's happening in the streets what happened in the streets this summer if we were in the moment of incipient fascism that people like to imagine and the people especially who specifically say that Trump himself symbolizes some sort of uh rampant fascist movement they would be the street would be filled with paramilitaries fighting back and what has actually happened you have some pathetic like three dorics in Hawaii'. shirts standing around not making eye contact with anybody, getting like a couple shots for tick tock and then going home, a couple of insane guys who just come out of their cars to start shooting people, but this is the country of l of of lone wolves shooters, we love doing that, don't we folks, no organized counter opposition really uh in the streets anyway from the citizenry, it's been the cops, and that's just it is is that we can see from the... composition of forces that that right-wing mobilized politically politically aware base doesn't exist, they've been demobilized, they've been essentially intentionally demobilized as part of that worship of material comfort, I mean if you love America more than anything, then you love consumption, those two things are, that's one is the expression of the other, and so you are, you've been immobilized by your own pursuit of pleasure, and I don't, this is... theoretical look, they're not out in the streets, the the like, there was a march through some suburb and a bunch of them stood by the side of the road looking downward, and a lot of people are saying, if they come here and and comes here, but they're not going to leave, because not only is it because their pleasure, pleasure dededened, they're also they don't know, they don't communicate with each other, they don't have any kind of squad structures, you they don't have any durable social bonds, things on the computer, now that doesn't mean that we are not in a moment where there might be a crisis where democratic institutions can no longer protect that gooeyget center of capital from the people, what's going to fill that gap is the existing and more technologically intensive than it was in the 30s, security state in the form of the cops and the military, and why that matters is it means the terrain of fight is different, it means first and foremost that... anti-fascism as an ideological project is less important than uh than uh proactive workplace and labor organizing along along the axis of labor exploitation and the redress of grievances and democratization of workplace and and and increase of access to things like healthcare. because my god if we're coming to that crisis point, the only thing that's going to stop tanks rolling from the streets is if there's too many people out there to shoot, got a couple more minutes here, got to anyone has any questions. It's getting dark, hold on, check this out, I got uh, I got some christmas tree lights up here, has anybody heard anymore about the fucking um, about the about that yellow king'. in Milwakee, because the day it happened, everyone was like, they just uncovered a police run pedifyle ring in this house and the cops like helped smuggle a bunch of guys out of there, and there's been no follow-up at all, and that's weird, because you know, even if the police are trying to cover this up, and even if the local media doesn't want to cover it, I would still imagine that the same people who were freaking out and tweeting about it too, three days ago have followed up and that there's some sort of someone pulling on these threads, so that makes me think that we have reached the point where of of a... escape velocity where we're never going to find out anything anymore because it takes too long to to follow up because we're moving too fast because everything's the next day or maybe the initial uh claims are being backed up and instead of people correcting them they're just kind of not saying anything i don't know which one's true but i would like to know either way i'm very very that whole story is freaky. Well, I mean, for example, it was claimed that those two kids got uh, those that they rescued two kids from the house, where are the kids? That seems like something someone should know, that doesn't require uh the fucking journal sentinel, the journal sentinels polits are prize winning uh, investigative unit to figure out, the comm. a mass shooter is pretty crazy, i honestly think it's more likely that he just snapped from being anark, which is a classic thing that happens where being in two place, being two people at once makes your brain break, but i mean i guess i could imagine, i just i'm always skeptical on mass shooter shit because i don't buy the motive, Canada already has gun control, and we have never enacted gun control thanks to thanks to mass shooting. and the idea of like oh we need to keep uh uh oh they need to keep doing that to keep us off our toes and to keep us disoriented and scared of one another i mean i honestly think it's a little naive to imagine they would have to go through with that we got we have more guns than people in this country as it is do we really and and and like the formula the formula on the on the on the uh chalkboard for a culture that would produce mass shooters it checks out you know there's no like extra space that we need to to put false flags in, now if you people have an idea that like no, the the the mask shooting is like a cover for something else, okay, but I would need to have an idea of what the other thing is, because I just can't buy, oh yeah, we're going to shoot a bunch of people or pretend to shoot a bunch of people, so people can uh tweet about gun control for a couple days, it's everything's already, everything's moving. so fast it is, it is so like horrifyingly destabilizing, how could you distinguish between the the the the seaded events in the real ones, and i guess the question then becomes what difference does it make? i mean i'd certainly think that uh the botched stink. are responsible for a lot of shit uh boston bombing first amongst those. My patio is fine, leave me alone, I could, I could see the idea of like the gun loby doing it to get people to buy more guns, but that's that's. That's like - hallmark invented Valentine's day level of analysis, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, I got to go in guys, it's coming down.
