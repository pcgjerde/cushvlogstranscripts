 on it up doing podcast, broadcasting, broadcasting, time to broadcast, broadcasting on the internet, can you believe it, the modern age we live in, allowing people to broadcast from their own telephones, these things used to just be call for calling people, call up your aunt gerty and ask how she's doing, call up the pizza man and see what's shaking, this is the first time, we've had been able to talk to people on the internet, i'm sorry, telephone, this is the first time telephones have been used to broadcast on the internet, welcome to the future you've always dreamed of, there i am, i'm on the computer and the phone at the same time, you know what, it kind of makes up for everything else, the whole dizying collapse situation, the uh the... pockle climate disasters and such, i am on my computer and my phone at the same time, if i could put this motherfucker on a on a chrome cast onto a television, i will have completed the trifecta, i will have hit for the cycle as it work, i'm not getting any comments yet, am i actually broadcasting, there you are, there are the comments, ah yes, now i know i'm being viewed, hello everyone, It's very muggy here, it's going to rain, it's going to rain tonight, and I think cool things off, which will be nice, and then it's just going to rain like crazy because of whatever tropical storm is going to show up, so today the president did the thing that everyone was freaking out about, he suggested, hey, maybe we delay the election, what do you think, until we can figure it out? everyone freaked out, people, first you had the wave of of institutionally invested liberals saying: Okay, don't worry, that's unconstitutional, then you had the draumatized populist screaming back, when has that stopped them before, but I've got to say, right now, I'm putting my money, and as I said, as I must always stipulate, I don't know what the hell is happening, none of us do, we're only guessing, we're blindly flailing in the dark, so we can only project forward our our understanding very, very close to the front of us, so anything beyond a few feet is is missed, shadow. wasn't missed, but my guess there is he's setting up an alibai for losing, way to wind about it, because as people pointed out, yeah, if he wants to not have an election, he could do that, I guess, he could say that, he could order that to be done, and maybe Baba and the justice department say, like Pompeo suggested, yeah, okay, that's fine, but the election isn't um carried out by the um, elections aren't carried out by the United States'. government, it should be, but it's not, they're carried out by the states, so unless he's going to send the nation like military units to occupy democratic states to force them not to vote, that doesn't work, if they have an election and he's like claiming, he's throwing a flag on it and saying, none of this counts because uh, you're doing mail order ballots and we need to delay it, that would could be affirmed in court, and it could be affirmed by as people have pointed out, you know the... states that bidan wins that have republican legislatures could hypothetically give those uh electoral votes to Trump even if he didn't win them and none of that is technically impossible I guess but I don't see him having the buy in with any of these institutions necessary to have them help him do that I mean a good example I would say is Matt Beven'. uh Matt Beven is the recently ousted governor of Kentucky, he had one term, he basically promised to undo Obamacare in Kentucky, a state that has more poor people in it per capita than almost any state we have, uh, and he did that, he fucking he cancelled the program that was working well to provide uh low cost healthcare to people in a state that desperately needed it, a real piece of shit uh, but he also governed is just a a Trump-like contradiction heightener, he he he covered his corporate agenda with constant antagonistic culture war, and the thing is, and so then he ran against the son of the last governor, Stephen Brasher, and brusheer won, but Beven tried to challenge the results. Beven tried to say that he wasn't going to recognize the votes and he could have, and he was going to make a demand for a recount, even though he was outside. margin of error for one, at which point all bets are kind of off, and this is a situation where technically this could have worked, even if it was destroying norms, it could have happened because the Kentucky has a has a republican control legislature or did at that time, i don't what it is now, and so they could have voted to yes endorse beven's call for a recount against even the royals and they didn't do it because they didn't like him either, he had no investment with the state GOP because he had governed like a one man ranking crew bent on his own self-aggrandizement and so when he lost that was a gift for the republicans in the house and senate. there didn't have to deal with him anymore and i am saying that if the chips actually fall for a for a Trump ask cou attempt where he has to press the button that says all of this this hypothetical loyalty that is now trickled out through the entirety of the republican party apparatus must now all be brought into action on my behalf right now i don't think that that was what would happen i think he might press the button but then it would' activate anybody because they would want to get him rid of him too, they want to get rid of him fucking too, and even if they don't, i don't think the true believers are in enough sufficient positions of of of of um leverageable influence in the requisite array of institutions, state, federal, judicial, legislative, military, law enforcement, they would have to come together behind that. just don't see it, now on the other hand, he thinks he's going to lose, he wants to have a way to lose in his mind without having lost, and that is to call the whole thing rigged and then walk away, now that's going to get people killed i think, i think you're going to see more than a few few uh queue people get pushed off the edge by that uh and yeah there'll be some some mass shootings maybe or temps, i mean the the the q score so far is very low, letality of Q is very low, even the most damaged queue people seem to be too damaged to successfully kill many people. you got that guy who uh who just posted up in a van across the uh across the hoverdam holding up a sign demanding that like some attorney general's report be uh declassified like Trump Trump's got this whole master plan for queue and he's going to drop the thing on his say so but no he's going to listen to this idiot to fucking wave to sign. in front of the hoverdam instead, that undermines, like that, that act means you don't even understand your own theory, it's trust the plan, they know best, and you're going to push their fucking, it's like they're committing here, they're at, it's like Job, they're asking things of God, where were you when I i i hung the heavens, how dare you fucking tell me when I'm supposed to release the attorney general's plan or arrest the pedophiles, no man shall know the hour of the day. and there was that guy who went to come and just like shot one hole through uh through the wall and then left, apparently there was a queue guy in Sweden who chopped his girlfriend's head off and there been there was like a cuw guy who killed his father with a uh katana, that's gonna happen, but that's what it's gonna be, because since when to anybody but Trump and his supporters, not people in power, not, not military leaders, not people in Congress, most people in Congress, except for the real shiny eyeed uh, true believers, even in the judiciary, none of these people, they don't view the the the ascension of a regular democratic uh administration as apocalyptic, because for the most part they have not entirely ingested the cool, now when they do, then all this is over, once that happen. once the republican party is completely on the same page and has fully metabolized the notion of the democrats as existential threats in themselves on par with like the communist party in the 40s, then all off, i don't think we're there yet, but of course let me stipulate, i didn't think we were, i thought that trump made sense and that trump ask figure was in inevitable, but i thought we weren't there yet, but once again i think the difference. is we're talking about an electorate in one hand, which basically went to Trump not because of of a overwhelming, you know uh, being taken with his message, mostly by disaffection and people checking out, and uh, this would be the decisions of people at the highest levels of of uh, of all the sinues of our of our state, uh, and they, I don't think they yet see it that way. I think they still are like, we can do business with them, Joe Biden, I know that guy, we made money during Obama, everybody made out, everybody got to do whatever they wanted to do, the army guys got to kick up sand and and the CIA guys, got to have fun adventures in uh Ukraine and uh and Syria and Libyan shit uh the the cocaine flow continued the uh the child the child wrangling and uh and trafficking networks hummed along the the the the symphony of commerce was uninterrupted Biden is explicitly telling them more of the same their fucking uh party met explicitly to to denounce in in noun certain terms the insurgent left on that is part of their broad electoral coalition and they have every ability to do that because that insergent left has no institutional ability to provide leverage against the democratic party in any way, not yet anyway. this is not a situation where people are going to risk it all. for a man who most people who know him know is not in any way stable or more importantly loyal or competent or any of the things you would want in somebody. you're going to go fucking cross the rubicon for. i think the reason people are are more credulous at this than they probably should be is because they are imbibing all of these cultural products and all of this output, social media output by his voters. and although the process of the voters views slowly and similating through capillary action up into the upper reaches of the party, which is definitely happened, it's not a complete process. i don't think we have enough proof of that. but again that's in that's in august or that's in late june in November who the fuck knows what the brown conditions will be who knows how the economy and COVID uh and the protest movements and the escalation with between police and uh protesters and good old fashion um good old fashion race conflict I mean there's there's a number of groups out there. who are angling to to prov provoke a shooting war uh a a helter skelters conflagration and uh you know I don't think that's likely but there's there's tinder and as a result that's why I can't say with any kind of certainty what I think is going to happen but I'd say right now right now Trump is pleating that not as a not as a uh I don't even understand what the idea is if he wants to do that he should just do it I guess no what do they call it uh Yeah, testing the water, he's testing the water for this, maybe, but when has he ever, I mean, does that really describe his communication style, gently testing the water for certain ideas, or does he reflexivelly just tweet about what he sees, he watched a guy on Stuart Varney show on fox news, a Fox business, some fucking uh, some guido ass fucking uh, republican pizzaria owner in Long Island, he sees him going like Trump's doing a great job, and he goes, uh, get the pizza, it's wonderful, that's as much thought as he puts into this shit, and so why is he saying that? because he wants an excuse, maybe in a few months he'll look around and be like, holy crap, maybe i can hold on to this thing, but right now i think he looks around and he sees, not good, and the thing is he might be wrong, maybe Trump wins, you know, polling, obviously, 2016 and really put the stake in the heart of any kind of confidence you can have in poly, but for me, down to this: it's often been said that every election involving an incument president ends up boiling down to one question that every voter subconsciously or consciously asks themselves and that is, are you better off now than you were four years ago, and that traditionally has been what re-elects or defeats an incument. now take Obama, for example, things were pretty bad in 2012, employment rate was like 9%, i think uh, it was still the recovery was early in rocky, but he was elected during an a literal economic meltdown, he was elected in in the middle of a slow-motion economic collapse, and so people were better off, even if things got worse, like even if things solidified into something worse, they were solid, that's an improvement. George, hw Bush, just one of the great his just tragic stories. the beauty, I think I've talked about this, the beautiful poetry of this guy who mastered the sinues of the American state and party system and and uh its connection to to petroleum uh and the world markets, the guy, it's like he's basically Christopher Plommer in Siriana, this maestro, CIA agent, republican uh grey eminence, the man who basically forged the alliance between eastern capital and the emerging sunbelt west, uh ran more coke through central America than Pablo Escabar and the Kali Cartel combine uh no literally knew where the bodies were buried, maybe up to including JFK. and he got and he's a loser one termer because of a tiny little recession that hit in early to uh 1992 just it was barely a big it wasn't even a big one and it immediately the recovery from it was was galloping you you had the whole clinton boom after that he even engineered a war to keep his numbers up if anybody's listen to blowback the Iraq war was a fucking was a trap laid by the Bush administration to give a pretext for a war that they could then prosecute that would boost his poll numbers, create a new American led military order to fill the gap created by the collapse of the Soviet Union and to justify cold war or higher levels of military spending in the face of calls for their cut. They told they told Hussain in so many words, we don't care if you invade. Kuwait just like we didn't care and in fact encouraged you to invade Iran so he does it so that we can smash it so that we can squash him like a butt and it worked 80% approval rating god emperor fucking bush no more wimp comments ever but he did it ended too early we won to good and then the economy just had a little bit loser clinton gets the dot com early.com fucking bubble money gets to just get him through there in 1996, bridge to the 20th century, 21st century, and in my memory I cannot think of a president who has gone into a re-election where people's answer to that question will be universal, more universally no. now of course, for a lot of people a disturbingly large number, that's not going to matter, because they have an internal ideological buffler that turns the awfulness of what around them into more proof of how good he is, but that is not enough people to reelect him, i hope people get that. "I hope people haven't like convinced themselves through just the ubiquity of Trump and and his his the solidity of his base that it is a majority in anyway even among the half of people who vote, it is around 40, 40 to 42%. And I would say the vast majority of everyone else is going to answer fucking hell no I'm not, unless you're Jeff Bazos, fuck no, I'm not better off than I was at four years ago, and elections are. still want at those margins, and so you know, assuming that we actually get an election that is able that assuming the COVID situation in November is sufficient to allow for an election that goes off with any kind of legitimacy, that's a big if, I think he's going to lose, and probably by too big of a margin for him to even uh, to even realistically claim fraud in a way that would get others to rally to his banner. but like I said that's right now, but I mean how the hell do you beat that how do you answer that question? unless the person is like I've talked about the the liberal anti-racist idea involves talking to people who have essentially already agreed with your premise. It's the same way with this, the only way to spin the question of how are you better off now than you were four years ago is to have someone already invested in the idea that well you know Trump is trying to change everything for the better and uh media and the chinese and and all of the democrats and even the republicans they're trying to stop it. unless you already believe that there's no way that you can look at his performance and find it salutatory to your life, saluatory, whatever. but we'll see, we'll see, we'll see. the fact that he's running against a senile mommy who does not appear to nowhere. uh, that's a concern, but I kind of think that, I kind of think Trump is countermobilizing enough to to outway that. I don't think buse, I think a lot of people, there's always this, there's the theory of like mobilization that you're that um, there's something called countermobilization where you by activating your core supporters, also activate the core for support. Hillary was going to win in 2016, they believed, well yeah, okay, we know Hillary is in terribly popular, she stands in for a lot of things people don't like, and that means the republicans even if they don't like Trump are going to come out to vote against her, but Trump is just as countermobilizing for our side, people hate him and don't want him to be president, and I think one of the big shocks of 2016 is that there was an ace to vote against, you were voting, you didn't want him to be in because he seemed like a bad guy and erratic and racist and all that, but you weren't really tacking a agenda to that other than just a morphist badness if you're a liberal. uh, for conservatives, Hillary Clinton stood in for very specific legacy that they abhor, uh, and I think that the thing that's going to work for the democrats advantage this time is that I think Biden is much less counter mobilizing than Hillary was. and Trump now that he's been president for four years and it has gone as badly as the most dire prediction of someone who didn't like him on the day he won how it would have gone that's going to take fill in the gap of Biden enthusiasm. That's the theory. I don't know if it's true. I suspect it might be. Because people don't hate Biden the way that they hated Clinton. like his entire, his entire hit on Biden is now about competence and brain power, and the thing is, people don't actually care that much about that, because they kind of know at a certain level, the president doesn't really run anything, it's a whole fucking squad, it's a team, and then there's the vice president, it's like doesn't, and and it's not like Trump is setting the world on fire, the guy spent two months bragging about passing a basic cognitive faculty test, essentially passed, he he braged about like uh passing a concussion protocol that doesn't make the contrast and that was with Hillary's problem is that she could never make the contrast with Trump work because everything you could say about uh Trump had a symmetrical thing you could say about Hillary from corruption to sexual assault and harassment uh crooked charities uh no account no talent kids uh getting jobs they don't deserve uncanny not the same thing. here, what does Biden represent? Biden represents the Obama years, which where during which nothing like this happened, and Trump represents this, I think that's, I think, I think people need to kind of get over this trauma from Trump winning, whereby now they're going to credit him with a power over like the psychy of the American voter that I think is not really accurate, but always a caviot, we'll see buse, i always get this shit wrong anyway, just laying out, more than anything, i'm just laying out my thought process, you can agree or disagree with that, more than like the conclusion, god if we don't if we don't get we're not going to get a debate, i'm positive, there's going to be no debate, certainly not in person, which is the only way it really would have been fun, like if it's a zoom debate, it's already ruined, that's the best we can hope for, like dueling town halls and and dueling like enclosed bunkers, it's really depressing, there's no way that DNC allows there to be a hunter Don Junior debate, even though, yeah, it's the same way like Herban Kane is like the high, that's about where we're going to top out in terms of... people biting it from covid, which is still very, very, very low, just and we're not, we're not going to get any kind of good debate, it's a bummer, real bummer, man, unemployment is not going to be allowed to expire, i mean they might fuck it up, but that's that's like that's how there's a lot of malevolence in the covid bungling, but there's also a lot of just sheer incompetence and lack of institutional capability, there's a chance that congress is too dysfunctional to pass something that everyone knows has to pass, that could happen. but I mean they make the rules, deadline Schmedline, they can, they can fix that in post, that's kind of the whole deal, they're right the laws, uh, so I think that that's this, this thing isn't going to collapse because somebody pressed a button that said make it fall apart, you know, that's not going to happen, no one's going to hit their ass on the self-destruct button, it's going to be people making decisions that they think are in the best interest of the moment that RQ cumulatively catastrophic, and that was not cumulatively catastrophic, that is self-destructive, that's detonating a suicide fast in the heart of the American economy, why would they do it, and the answer, oh they they're they're sick, the cruelty is the point, that's the kind of emotionalist shit honestly that obscures proper analysis of material conditions, so yesterday somebody was really haller me for some uh Regan Land uh, a Regan Land update, I hope they're listening or watching or will at some point, because uh, I kind of... I spent the weekend, I was off doing stuff, I didn't uh, I didn't really read any, but I got back into it, 1979, and there is some stuff in here about uh, about the neoliberal turn of Carter that is uh, genuinely uh, I mean the material is obviously very relevant, but pearl scene frames it in a very insightful way, uh, so basically he's talking about how by 1979 Carter is completely convinced that that that inflation, which was the number one domestic issue, it's hard to imagine, but yes, inflation because it was very high, it was it was almost double digits, which was just wiping out savings uh, and freaking people out, because at that point people weren't all all debt riddled at that point, debt was was rare, debt was to be avoided, it was not just the condition. of life now uh the way it is now uh so people it just drained away people's savings uh and he points out actually that one of the big things that leads to the credit the shift to credit is people start wanting to buy expensive things right away rather than saved for them because it's impossible to save with inflation too high so charge it and pay a rate of interest that will still be cheaper than waiting too long and seeing the thing get too expensive. uh, but Carter's answer to this was, oh, inflation is caused by government spending, specifically deficits and he pursued that to his his party is essential, imilation, like destroying his own party, and then it had, the carcas rotted on the street until it got filled in by uh, the DLC and uh the same corporate interests who had taken over the who owned the Republican party uh, and he did that. out of mis a a a delusional belief in in the the causes of government uh the causes of inflation and then what's really most notable even more than that is that so carter says oh look we got to we have to live within our means we have to stop them we i i have to be a politician for the first time since the world war i has to tell people to tighten their belts to say that they can't they have to do more with less which is not that goes against 40 years of a democratic uh politics, how am i, i mean that's that's undermines our entire electoral uh uh raise on debt, there's no other reason, what's the point of the democratic party if they're not there to hand out goodies from an ever expanding economy uh and so like his uh his liberal uh policy director in 1979 said that carter mus face the new reality he inherits, he must govern based on fact and situations handed to him, he cannot recreate the 60s when he must govern, when he must govern with the far different problems of the 70s, an era of constraints, they're saying we need to constrain, and in that and he never asked the question, well what do you do, how what does that mean politically, and I think that's because he had an assumption buried in his assumptions, which was, okay, this fact, this new America must live within its means reality, well because this is true, the republicans know this too, and that means we're both parties are going to have to govern now and campaign with the understanding that austerity is the new normal, but as a republican, if I'm Ronald Reagan and I'm looking to take over the reigns of government and recreate it, and all it standing between me and that is this fucking pencilneck telling people that they need to wear sweaters in doors and they can't go out. for eat anymore or get a fucking car, what is my incentive to go along with his horse shit about austerity, especially when some fucking uh some voodo priests have brought up this beautiful thing, this beautiful uh enchantment called supply si economics where i can just say no no we cut taxes and that takes care of it, we can still you can still have indulgence at every level, you might have to uh borrow some money, but it's fine, it'l all work out, he's under no requirement to listen to to do it's best for. country as though that's some sort of objective thing, he can tell people whatever they want to hear, which is what he did, he sold them a line, that's why this book about the rise of Reagan is the invisible bridge, he sold them a fucking fake bridge built on built on a fantasy that was entirely funded by debt uh and deindustrialization, but that's not what he told people, he didn't say there what that's where they were making the he did, there was no informed decision that that was the tradeoff people. were making, it just is what happened, because he wanted to win, there's a story about Carter getting leaked, Regan's debate. prep book in 1980 uh and then giving it back without looking at it, part and parcel, there is no, there is nothing making the republicans have the the democrats buried assumptions about like the guard rails on responsible behavior in government, fuck that. i also wanted to uh point to one other. think that's very funny, he had a uh, in late 1978 there was a state state visit by Deng Xiaoping who was just consolidating his rule in China and starting the process of uh marketization uh, and I just want to read this quickly, uh, the state visit proved a tonic for the battered president soul, quote, he's small, tough, intelligent, frank, courageous, personable, self-assured, friendly, and it's a pleasure to negotiate. with him, carter wrote in his diary, something he'd never say of the congressional leadership of his own party, and I think that's very fitting, because Jimmy Carter is basically the Deng Xiaoping of the republic of the Democratic party, so no no wonder they really got along. I do like though that he lists all this great stuff about how great Deng Xiaoping is, but the first thing he says is small, like he's a like he's a tumblr guy, oh my god, dang, you're so small, you're such a small beat. Ah, you're tidy, oh, look at you, decollectivizing agriculture, ah, small boy, uh, somebody's asking if I've read behold a pale horse, uh, behold a pale horse is a book by Milton William Cooper, uh, that is a conspiracy favorite, it's essentially unified field theory for all, all all UFO, conspiracies, secret. societies, it's it's it's got everything you need, uh, the Soviets and the Americans meeting in a submarine under the Antarctic, but I haven't read the whole thing, because it's not, the pros isn't simulating, but I know I know the mains the main arcs of it as a conspiracy, as as a deeply uh, stued conspiracy uh, fan, I, I'm aware of the arks, I haven't, I'll admit, I generally don't read a lot of the a lot of the classic. text themselves, because most of those guys don't really not to write uh and they love repeating themselves and larding things with purple pros, just give me the bullet points, that's why i want to throw this out there for anybody likes conspiracies, one of my favorite documents in conspiracy lore is the skeleton key to the gemstone file, it's i this is a thing that i found on web 1.0 when i was in high school, i printed it off and read it in in like during lunch and it's this: amazing layout of of uh like 20th century history through the lens, it's like a James Elroy history of the 20th century where Aristotel onasus is like the kingpin of all world crime, he's like fucking fumanchu uh and he of course assassinates the president Kennedy, but assassinates a million other people uh in pursuit of uh global uh organized crime racketering profits and also kidnaps and replaces with a double Howard Huse, but the thing. I like about it is it's bullet points, it's this date, this thing happened, like a telex, very elroy also, uh, I read it right around the time I read American Tabloid, and man, that was peanut butter and jelly, uh, so love the skeleton key that the gemstone file, but just one more thing about Cooper, uh, so yeah, Bahil depo horse is conspiracy, very a classic seminal conspiracy text, a lot of people have read it, uh, not terribly rigorous, but the thing I think it's funny about him most of all though is that less than a week after 911 he was confronted by like US marshals or something over a over like his refusal to pay taxes uh and he got a huge shootout with them on his front porch and he shot one of them in the face i think and he got lit up and killed that happened less than a week after 9/11 i just imagine somebody who was a big fan of his finding that out and just being like what and then of course hanging with refers to the Mark curry sitcom from the 90s hanging with Mr. Cooper, I thought I put how put the guy's full name in there as a classic uh bit of pun based synergy, which I like to do with the titles for some of these, like a little make them up, we like to have fun here at the twitch at the twitch stream of chapo fym. Apparently the Chinese have bought 60,000 tons of of gold to try to put the this to put the yan on the out there is a world currency. i don't about that. i mean, my guess is it's a hedge, i think everything's just hedges. i think all these moves, i don't think anybody's plant. i really, it feels more and more to me like everyone is just hedging their bets until the jenga tower collapses rather than pursuing any meaningful long-term strategy. i just don't think that there's the - stability, the resource stability, climate stability, uh, geopolitical stability to to lend itself to significant long-scale, long long-term planning by anybody, so my guess is that they're just covering their asses, but uh, if they make a move that's going to be, that's a hell of an escalation right there, Katie might have to bar the door on that one, oh boy. What's going on everybody? I think there's one more thing in here I wanted to talk about, let me see if I can find it. Oh this this is it, I remember now, so talking about how Carter in the second half of his term is trying to figure out a way to package this austerity message, first time ever for a democrat to tell people that they're not going to get more, more in your paycheck with the democratic message for 40 years it work, how are they supposed to to do this, the responsible thing. we're doing the responsible thing and surely the republicans will follow our lead. it's like not, it's amazing, the levels of the self-deception and just downright uh failure to recognize reality are stunning. first just buying the horse shit about uh uh about deficits being the cause of inflation without a thought and then assuming further more that the republicans were going to have any good they're preparing the state of the union address for 1979 uh preparing for sorely rattle the speech writers worried about that Carter failed to inspire and had no clear idea of where he is leading the country, they decided it was past time to devise a catchy two words slogan, Kennedy's new frontier, Johnson's great society, Roosevelt's new deal. Their dilemma, however was simultaneously inspiring, clarity and credibly acknowledging the intractably complex interlocking problems the nation faced. It was compounded by the fact that the problems conceivable solutions all lay in the distant future with no political dividends in the to be harvested for the work required to get there. They decided to try to convince the public that the essence of Carter's accomplishments was initiating a process. They tried out phrases like, "New ground work and new building blocks. Someone suggested new foundation. Can't we do better, one speech writer carpet? Apparently not. Some form of new foundation appeared in the speech 13 times. Sounds like a lady's undergarment, said one commentator, Daniel Patrick Moinand pointed out that the phrase appeared in the first stanza of the communist. handsome the international, there's your boy, Daniel, being a fucking epic troll as always, but that really does grab, grasp a fundamental hingepoint in democratic politics and that is the moment when the democratic party went from pitching voters on a outcome and started pitching them on a process, we are not promising anything, we don't give anything, the market provides, what we is provide a process that allows the market to provide, and that is not what the democrats used to say, they used to say, you got social security because president president fucking Roosevelt, there was a uh there's a billboard and I think the 1936 in West Virginia that said the president knows that your boss is a son of a bitch, your pay packet is going to go up every year, that was the promise, more you, more jobs, higher wages at those jobs, not just jobs, jobs got detached from wages right around this time uh, and talk about... jobs completely detached from wages too, and carter is when they can't, the democrats cannot responsibly make promises and because the... party is inherently, they're responsible, that's what a democrat is, they cannot not be responsible, then all you can do is offer a process, all you can do is offer to be a fair guardian of interests, to be to be a umpire or a alignsman, and then you got the republicans, they're not necessarily offering anything material, but they offering something, something spiritual, something visiral, which is defending a culture, which is defending a a conceived way of life and concept of hierarchy, that's going to be fucking that's going to be persuasive in the absence of any material claims by either party. Carter is a shit, absolute dog shit president, and I think that like the fact that liberals love him a while, I used to think liberals are are wrong to like Carter. No, no, no, liberals should love Carter, Carter is the ideal democratic president, because he did the right thing against his political interests and it cost him the White House, but not his integrity. There is no more perfect democrat than Jimmy Carter. Of course liberals love Carter. Carter one. that uh that nomination because he was a sipher, he he was also uh, he was obama-like in that way, he was promising to redeem a nation traumatized by Vietnam and Watergate, because he was a ostentatious born again Christian, yes, they us, there used to be democrats, actual democrats who were like that, not just dixocrats, like new south democrats were also evangelical bap uh uh Christians, he was an evangelical Christian, he had a sterling reputation, he was a son of the soil for god's sake, and a nuclear engineer, and he also had a top rate PR shop that was as cynical and as manipulative as Nixon's invent in 68, the guys from Joe Mcginness's uh, making of a president, and then when he got in there after promising to all things all people, he ended up being nobody to anybody, and for democrats his tale is the perfect, that's the way all de all democratic uh, like in in the the process-minded democratic uh uh uh morality play that is always in the back of the mind of like the fully conditioned post watergate liberals uh should end in being voted out of office for casting a vote. that your constituents don't like, so Carter's holding the line on the budget, holding the line on deficits, refusing to try to create a new a new arrangement that maybe I don't constrain corporate power and profit at the instead of making uh, instead of ending inflation on the backs of uh labor share of uh of the surplus? no, he he he accepted the parameters laid down by the narrow uh uh bourjois experts, the narrow range of of opinions of the bourjois experts, he surrounded himself with, because by that point uh the the power of the labor movement was waining over the Democratic party and they couldn't get they weren't there, they weren't in those rooms, they weren't there for long enough, they weren't persuading, they weren't persuading and then they also were not offering enough of a... danger to make someone act, they couldn't coerse or persuade, we whereas so that meant that the hegemonic uh neoclassical understanding was accepted as gospel, so he accepts this brainwashing without a thought, and then sacrifices his presidency holding to it, and that is that's that's that is the passion play, that's that's the great example of a christlike figure in politics, so yeah, love. but uh if you're liberal buse he is the ideal one of you and think about that, think about that, like do you want to be able to smuggly think that you you ran things uh with uh, you ran the country with a sense of honor or uh, is that okay? is that enough to make up for the fact you're a fucking historical laughing stock? Yeah, no, Carter was the first neoliberal president in that he had internalized neoliberalism at an ideological level, which I don't think any of the other ones had. I mean, partially because it wasn't yet fully formed, but he had he had internalized it, he believed it, like his his his diaries, we got to get that budget deficit under control, like they believe that shit. That's the thing, there might have been a cap, there was a a budding capital revolt happening under Carter's feet, but that's one of those things where these are mutually reinforcing phenomena, and like looking at the degree to which capital was able to reassert control over the political places in the 70s, absent analysis of the Carter administration's breakneck run towards neoliberalism, is incomplete, I think... you could assume that if they had actually fought on firmer terrain and attempted, i don't know to yoke the strength of the still much more powerful than it is now and much more organized American labor movement, maybe they could have fought back, he didn't want to though, like he was it was not even a question of him uh like bending the knee like the starks when Adam targerion showed up to avoid the north being burned up by dragonfire, they never they'... want to fight it, he went in there with we're going to take, I'm going to discipline this party, there are a bunch of kids running around, or there are a bunch of babies, big old babies looting the treasury for all their pork barrel and I'm going to spank their bottoms, so yeah, like Capital would have won probably in the end, Carter probably would have lost, but maybe the terrain is different, maybe it, maybe the party does not become the absolute husk it is, maybe maybe points of resistance. change the the shape of our descent and leave us now in a period of critical crisis with a higher capacity than we have to resist it. that's all you can ever say about any historical counterfactual, greater or lesser degrees of coping with the overwhelming and shaping forces of material history. now the real counterfactual is what if Reagan wins in 76 buse very could Reagan could have beaten uh Ford, I mean it came down to the Mississippi delegation at the at the uh convention, they were essentially tied at delegates going into uh last time that's happened uh going into... City in 76, and Reagan, I think won more votes in primaries than Ford did, if he didn't, it was close, for if Reagan had been the nominee, he could have beaten, he might have beaten Carter uh, and then he would have president over, he would have had to have given a republican gloss to austerity, unless he decided to just ignore it and spend like crazy anyway, because he didn't really believe any of that shit, so as you go, that's why... things are different, i don't know, you really you really need the perfect storm of of of these self uh self policing process dorx taking over at that exact moment, but ragan absolutely still would have broken labor, uh, no question about that, but the thing is he did that in the 80s and it didn't matter, yeah, you know what, that's it. somebody was we were somebody was asking me about the difference between the analog and the digital high and i was trying to talk about how you know digital high is sort of a simulacrum it's it's it's it's a ones and zeros version of getting high and somebody says it's shorter lived and that is it yeah it's uh it just doesn't last doesn't have any kind of resonance. uh uh Leonardo Dicaprio is playing Grant, I thing is I like Leo, I thought he was fantastic in once upon a time in Hollywood uh, and his performance in Wolf of Wall Street is an alltimer, he got fucking ripped off, I i didn't like the revenent and he wasn't good in it, but I consider that compensation for getting ripped off for not winning Wolf of Wall Street, his just just just him winding up. the the floor, the boiler room floor, those scenes are phenomenal, but I don't know if I buy, the thing about grant is the grant was and this is the problem with making the grant the focus of a... movie is that Grant was a guy who faded into the background, he was not a prominent personality, he was and especially contrasting in an era of just peacock motherfuckers like George McLallan with his little Napoleon with his fuss old old fussen feathers is what they called uh Windfield Scott or because of the ordinateness of his uniform and his pension for pageanttry uh Grant, just blood spattered boots in a private uniform, very soft. spoken rare for rare to get angry uh his whole like anything that's charismatic and interesting about him is about like just being a a a a cool and calm presence and i think that could work in battle scenes especially like shilo is a great example yep uh he's he gets he gets buffalowed and uh absolutely absolutely just shocked by a surprise confederate attack that almost drives him into the fucking river uh and that night he's a camp where everybody's frantically trying to you know dig in and worried about something worried about the next day nobody knows what's going on and sherman comes up to grant and he goes well we've had the devil's owne day and grant goes yeah looking tomorrow though and then they did they kick their ass uh so that could be work, but like I just don't see Leo is that guy, Leo is the coldron, Leo is the simmering pot, the vein, it's like when I think of some actors have like a a some physical feature that is where they're acting sort of concentrates and for me uh with Leo, it's that line in the middle of his forehead, it's just this like center, it's like a seam, it's like a tectonic plate con'. point while this lava comes out, that's not grant, and also grant didn't really have a have a lot of like dramatic moments, i mean chick uh chattenuga is very, very dramatic, but he just watched that, i mean he was a general, i don't know, i don't know, i think grant would be more interesting in a in a movie about the presidency than about about the war, broling could maybe work, brolen has that like quiet reserve thing, i actually thought Jared harris kind of got it, some people don't like him in lincoln, but i thought i mean you know buse he's not a guy who does a great american accent, but i just thought that his sort of quiet uh centeredness was appropriate. but i mean i'll watch it, there's no question about that, if we still got tv, if we still got movies and we still have uh programming, i will watch it. now grant the clan would be interesting, my favorite movie about the civil war will always be glory because i saw it when i was a kid and the endings hit me so profoundly and emotionally that it basically made me single-handedly into a civil war nerd so uh so yeah, none's going to beat that one. Sherman would make a better movie, the march to the sea is genuinely apacalyptic, and that that really depicted on screen would be would be amazing, and Sherman is much more of a character than Grant was, buse uh, buse Grant, he was like a melancholy alcoholic and a quiet one at that, whereas uh, I would say that I think they've like remotely. diagnosed Sherman with like manic depression or bipolarity or something, he famously said of Grant, I stood by uh, he stood be, he stood by me when I was crazy and I stood by him when he was drunk, he's got the red hair too, ah yeah, sherman movie would rip, yeah, sherman was a big neurotic, and that's another classic Sherman quote, is he says, like I'm smarter than Grant, I'm more tactically. strategically uh uh adept than him, i've more read more on on on military theory, but there's one thing that he has me beat on, every day and that is that I cannot, he's that he does not care what the enemy is doing, he fully focuses on his disposition, whereas I cannot think of anything else than where the enemy is, and it it undoes me, and that's what undid a lot of uh, union generals, uh, uh, fucking mclellen more than anybody, and the contrast between mclellen and grant is so pointing because Mclellen was the boy genius, he was already call, they were calling him Napoleon before the war started. he thought of himself as like one of the great American military officers before he was his first battle which is one of the big things that contributed to him as well as his sympathies for the south and slavery uh because he was a fucking copperhead basically my god terrible terrible terrible disastrous choice but um but anyway had to happen you know losses in the lessons one of the big reasons he wouldn't fight is because he did want to lose, you want to destroy his impression of himself and the world's impression of him, so he just drilled and drilled and drilled and organized the army, everybody talks about what a great organizer and logistics guy he was, like yeah, that's all he did, no, I hope he would be fucking good at it, and then when he fought, he fought poorly, he won every battle in the seven days, but he retreated after each one because he thought he was about to be overwhelmed, he of course, he got leese orders to his fucking divisions, they fell into... hands cuuse some asshole currier dropped him and rolled up in some cigars and he still nearly, he still fought, he still was only to able to get a draw at antitom, god imagine if grant had gotten these fucking orders, like a wrecking ball, and one of the big reasons he lost it, he didn't was unable to overwhelm an tecause he wouldn't commit his whole force at once because he didn't want to get beat, grant was a fucking loser, drummed out of the army for alcohol. only when they the first is because he didn't really have anything else to do, failed businessman, uh, kind of in-laws ashamed of him, wishing that the their daughter made a better choice, uh, so he didn't give a fuck, he was, he was, he was able to concentrate on what was actually in front of him, instead of fighting castles, fighting armys in the sky, like McLalin, and so he loses the first day of Chilo and he's like: Okay, we'll win tomorrow. I mean, my god, I, I, if Shilo had happened to Mclellan, I just imagine him like falling on his sword like a roman consul. Yeah, Grant couldn't even farm for Christ's sake. In the rich soils of the Midwest, which is literally, that's why people live there is cuuse you can farm. Ah, yeah, no, he has grant is the promise grant is the prob is that wig, is that wig, Jefferson to wig. like yoman farmer like citizens just the idea of like a whole citizen created in the frontier experience um but of course there is no such thing as a whole citizen and he had his uh he had his problems and his lacks and his lacuna eye as we all do and it helped undermine him although i don't really blame him for like it's not his fault that reconstruction and uh he he he pursued it with real vigur um it's just that if if we were gonna if we were going to hyper exploit the south after the war which is what everyone wanted to do everyone was waiting to just carve up that land uh then there was no way to build the sort of multiracial democratic society that would have basically the way we could have made reconstruction work is if we had made the agricultural south into the agricultural north as in people by this kind of small holding farmers like the grant family create more grants out of the out of the ex- slaves and the and the ex uh confederate smallholders by breaking up the but the thing is is that that cotton man that was the engine of the america one of the engines of the American economy replaced placing that with small holding tenent uh small holding land uh uh uh yoman producing like surpluses that they sell on the market for like goods like the at at the craft level, you've just pulled the engine out of your economic dynamo, so the question is, was there was there a hypothetical combination of elements existing in a shet a teer if they had, but dispossessed them entirely, no land, anybody, all plantations, not sold to to fucking speculators, all of them broken into lots and distributed to all races, 40 acres in a mule, you would have had to had some sort of economic alternative to uh uh the the the um to the cotton economy of the south, so it's it's an economic question question, and the problem is is that the same war that ended slavery, fittingly, the fighting of it created a capital concentration in the north that became overweening and soon enough essentially captured the entire uh infrastructure of government. which led of course to the monstrosity of the of the Gilded age and the Rober Baren rule. And that's why there is a like a revisionist left take on the civil war that says, the north was the bad guys, because they ended up doing the dirty work of finance capital to fully proletarianize like the south, and like that's true in that it's describing what happened, but it's the normative argument is absurd. nobody knew that that's what was happening and it didn't have to happen, just that's how the intersection of material reality and hampen stance, the arising stacastic chaos of of of the human natural order shaped us towards that, and the counterfactual question is like, would Lincoln surviving have been enough? uh, I don't think by itself, but my god it would have helped, oh jesus, that's i am, I'm fairly. agnostic on the question of JFK living making things much better, because honestly his assassination, I'm agnostic on whether he would have really ended Vietnam, but it's pretty clear that he was completely bucked on civil rights, he was in a log jam and his death cleared, so what happens with civil rights if if there's no like sacrifice of Kennedy to break break up the the senate log jam there, like how much does that exacerbate domestic uh racial conflict? There's all these questions you got to ask, so I'm like jf with everything with JFK, who killed him, whether he was good or bad, I'm I'm agnostic. Lincoln, I really think almost, we would have been slightly to, perhaps butterfly effects working in the right way, vastly better off if Lincoln had lived, but I don't think it would have been enough by itself, but it could have been a precondition for other things, I don't know, I also like to imagine. getting that commission to be the commander of the union army, because of course, to take off power was you got to make the slaves, the point of the war, and uh, because he would have, he would have waged a gorilla war, that he was a gorilla fighter, and that meant he would have when he captured, territory in the south, he not only would have freeed slaves, the way that and band uh without and and that was controversial because it was not without with it was without the orders of the uh of Washington, but he would have armed them immediately, created a created a literal insurgent, rolling insurgent army uh, which would have changed the the players uh in the post war political discussion, changed the terms of the debate and the and the and the conditions of the parties going through. the uh the political process immensely, but one of those tragedies of history is is that even though I think that that would have been acceptable at the end of the war among most northerners, I mean we are the union finally did arm black soldiers uh glorious about that uh and that they they fitted up some you know contraband units, but that was after. years of bloodshed and after slavery had risen in centrality to war aims in the early war where everyone really wanted to like keep it narrow and about of slavery at least at the top, i mean partially to ally racial anxiety, but also to keep border states from succeeding, i don't know, i've thought about this stuff a lot as you can imagine when i wasn't going on dates in high school. Yeah, that's so annoying about other. fucking columbus stuff with these fucking italiano guys, has no one offered to just do like switch it with garibaldi? i mean, for one thing, columbus is not italian, he was genoise, italy was not in any sense a unified country or concept, he was a genuine, garibaldi literally made italian in with thing, garibaldi is the reason you can even call yourself italian. and not calabreezy or something or uh napolitano, you dumb fucking trying not to use any any anti-Italian slurs here, but it's just very frustrating. I saw a uh, a billboard, it's apparently in kinetic. kit and it was paid for by some local italians and it says, the first Italian American, Christopher Columbus welcomes you to conneticat, and I thought that was pretty funny, buse for one thing, he's dead, I don't think he's he's welcoming me anywhere. Secondly, we can argue about whether he's italian, because you could say, oh yes, there might not have been an Italian state, but there was an Italian language, even though Italian is notoriously dialect like. uh dialect heavy and and and relatively uh unintelligible across relatively small distances traditionally um but even if you want to call him italian he 100% was not American by the way these people talk about America buse when people say like I'm italian American they don't mean in that like you know uh globalist like well the United States is not the only country in the Americas anyone in north and south america is definitely. an American, I'm going to call them a USI, because they're not American, now of course, these guys don't go for that bullshit, American is USA number one, and Columbus never set foot in the United States, he went to Hispaniola, and at one point I think he went to the South American continent, I'll fucking guarantee you the guys that put up that sign, not think that anybody from Hispaniola or South America is an American, I guarant goddamn to you, they do not. All right, this has been fun, it's a good when I've had a good time, I hope you have to, keep tuning in, bye-bye, oh, I think I might start riding.
