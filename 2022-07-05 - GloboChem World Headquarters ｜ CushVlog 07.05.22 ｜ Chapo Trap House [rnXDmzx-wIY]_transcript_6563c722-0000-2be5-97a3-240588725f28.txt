 Tell me who they run, John the revelater, tell me who that run, John the revelator, tell me who that right, John the revelator wrote the book of the seven seals, who that right, John the revelator, who that riden, John the revelator, whose writing down the revelator wrote the book of seven sc and oh god walked down in the cool of the day called adam by his name you refused because he's naked and ashamed tell me who that right john the revelator tell me who's that righting john the revelator tell me who's that righting john the revelater wrote the book of the seven seals. howdy folks, we're back, we're back with book five, part five of uh Leo Panich and Sam Gindens, the rise of global capitalism, this section called rule of global capitalism, we're talking now about the moments, the decades, the crucial last decades of the 20th century when capitalism became instantiated as a global system beyond uh uh the American role in it because you have the system is it's being set up in the post war world, it's headquartered in America and and is in many ways imposed by directly by America, but in these decades uh US capital is able to use its leverage against other capital formations and nation states to dictate the terms by which... international trade and law are going to operate in a way that is fully American uh and that leads to the situation we're in now where the American role in global capitalism is now fundamentally in conflict with global capitalism's greater urge movement towards deterritorialization. because America really has at this point, much like capitalism, outweight its usefulness within the system, uh, but there's nothing else, there's nowhere else for that power to go, so even though like the the the American state is the thing, all this other stuff rests on, and yet our political class is in the process of uh destroying itself, and destroying the uh the legitimacy of the system that props the whole thing up. and that's only possible because we cannot assimilate democratically our decline and our loss of uh position in global capitalism because we never spoke it, it was always a secret, it was always uh uh being sublimated into other conversations and other politics and now so now we can't say face it, it's literally impossible. uh so this first chapter 9 is called a rule of law governing global globalization uh, but before we get into it, i have to do another uh little digression to begin with here because somebody dm me and asked me to go into kensianism more, because we talk a lot about how keinsianism is inthroned as sort of the uh the theory that dominates like the economic thinking. of the imperial managers of America in the post war era and that keinsianism comes into terminal crisis in the 70s leading towards neoliberalism after it sort of exhaustself as a governing ideology and the question this person had is is to what degree is the true that cansianism came to a point where it could no longer be applied or did other factors cause people to just lose faith in the kensian solutions uh that they could have pursued. uh and I would say that at the end of the day it's meaningless distinction because what doomed Kainzianism was the fact that it supposed as its basis the notion that there is an overriding interest that can be uh discovered through democratic deliberative governance that can at every point like why good liberals could oversee capitalism while knowing that it was at that at that point knowing that it had failed because they all live through the great depression, but thinking that they were putting capitalism on a path to extinction. Kanes used to talk about the rent the eutilization of the rentiere class. He basically said, we have to do what the Soviets are demanding, get rid of class rule, it's it has to, they're a barnicle, they're a parasite, they will destroy the whole system, but the common. say you got to line them up and shoot him, no, no, no, we can use reform to control the economy, build institutions of like real democracy that can essentially buy out the ruling class so that you know they can keep their relative positions of wealth, maybe in the short term, but they have given up the ability to pass on their wealth generationally and dynastically, and that power and wealth is then socialized, uh, that's the dream. of canzianism uh, but and the problem is is that that was a false and incorrect uh and intentionally delusional read of the situation. what made Kainsianism work when it did, oh look, we don't have to worry about boom and bust, we don't have to worry about the destabilizing, destabilizing effects of cyclical downturns, like the fucking uh, the... neal classicals, the hacans insist we have to, we can stop that from happening completely by by moving the toggles, keeping us in the straighten arrow between inflation and unemployment, the we can we can fill the bucket with with federal spending uh supply or demand side stimulus uh that will keep us on an even kill and by being in an even kell you legitimize institutions of democracy and they expand. and therefore democratic control of the economy increases, but what actually happened is that democratic control of the economy during the period of cansian uh uh supremacy was dissolved, we've talked about it a million times with starting with Henry Wallis being replaced on the ticket in 44 to the uh the the republican wave election of 48 and taft hartle uh the red scare we talked about all this stuff uh and and like that's that's what that's the the stick, the cart of course being mass home ownership for for white uh workers, that success, capitalism's success at essentially subborning the state to operate it for it to operate, legitimize its own institutions, its own interests uh like a fucking parasitic larva, eating out the insides of an animal without even knowing it. uh, so when the crisis came, Kainsianism was at a loss, not necessarily because there wasn't a theoretical thing that keinsianism could have suggested, but because uh the constituency for uh, for any values beyond profit were totally uh obliterated, because at the end of the day the whip hand is with the profit motive, everything else is subsidiary to that under capitalism, regardless of the institutions that are governed. and that govern capitalism uh, in crisis, profit motive becomes the only thing that is protected, because it's the only thing that is actually unifying everybody in power, everybody is aligned along a profit motive, whereas people are discretely bunched together along ideological and empirical questions, they're all polarized like fucking iron filings around capital, whether they're in government or... whether they're in the private crote private sector, which is of course just the same thing from an institutional structural perspective, we just create these uh, these veils uh of separation and then perform them, and everyone just believes it because there's no alternative, what the fuck is water, and so that meant that when a crisis comes, there is nobody there to speak for a kensian solution. because at the end of the day the system is not governed by uh a a a disinterested notion of the greater good. people within government might imagine themselves to be operating off of those assumptions and they might do their best to uphold them, but their effort is only resonated with the effort of those who are just looking to make money. so that is the failure of... cansianism and that is why the MMT thing kind of annoys me because they're insisting look we've proven here that money isn't real and it's like well no shit. what does that help us? you're explaining how the system actually operates without the the mystificating mirrors, but getting people to believe a certain thing is true like that, does not make them act, and action is what is necessary now, like because the mmt fantasy is that if you get enough people to believe that this is how it works, then that will make the... act in a way that redemocratizes our institutions, but that's going to require work at a much more uh confrontational level, a more grassroots level than at the air abstractions of of monetary theory, and so yes, like keinsianism was also correct in a narrower sense. uh, but the thing that makes Kainsianism fail inherently is because embedded in Kansianism is the same theological belief that undergirds classical liberalism, which is that class rule is an inevitable and natural component of life, not hierarchy in some generic sense the way that guys like Jordan Peterson bring it, like differences in abilities or or skills, distributed through a population. which was used to prop up feudalism. we cannot socially sustain a belief in in a risen living god anymore, but we can still believe that the natural world is outside of us and it is governed by rules that we can only obey, and one of those rules, according to the high priests of capitalism since the 1900s has been that class rule is inherent and inevitable. and in fact necessary, because first you had neil, first you had like liberal orthodoxy, post protestantism, post puritaninism in England saying you, here's here's predestination in in in practice, the market is God, what its dictates are is God's will, we must submit ourselves to it, which is why they took the gold standard as their religious uh like their religious siggil, gold had a uh abstract natural value that was outside of human uh uh values and and human measurements, and that is of course not true, that is the delute, that's that is a religious belief, and it's net on top of the religious belief that class is inevitable, because these religious traditions exist, in a context of domination, are reproduced by systems of domination, so the people live within them and then benefit from them, of course are going to accept those theological conceptions. Marx comes along and says, actually no, that's all fake, humans are in charge of everything, what are you fucking talking about? no natural, are you insane? we make values, so that means that that rock is not what's going to determine how much money there is, we determine how much money there is, only right now the we is the ruling class, is the capital. class, it could be that we could be us, all of us, led by the working class and then we can socially determine where the fucking money goes, and what value is, and what, what, what, what to pursue, and that has been, that's the radical, you know, non, that's the radical, like ana-baptist Christian tradition that got suppressed by mainstream Christianity, the one that says, actually we're all saved, there is no, original sin, we don't need Christ in the form of the market to determine our worth, we can all live in heaven here on earth, and I believe that that if you don't have a utopian horizon like that in your politics somewhere, it doesn't have to actually like come into practical consideration ever, you never have to argue anybody with it, because it doesn't matter, it's it's it's it's just part of your identity. uh, without that you will eventually drift towards some flavor of authoritarian genocidal fascism, brutality over social uh civilization, because if you accept class is inevitable, therefore capitalist uh, the capitalist market uh is in is god, then if we are being destroyed by the market, as we cannot argue is not happening now, no one can argue that's not happening, no matter what they say, uh, well then we had it coming essentially, and the question only becomes who will suffer first and who will be saved, and who who will be protected, and that is always going to come down to some sort of shmidian. uh friend enemy distinction, and that's that's everybody's politics at the uh, if they do not have a belief that there is a human ability to control our destiny. now the thing about that gold standard mysticism of the 19th century is that eventually it was no longer sustainable, because during the 19th century you saw what it led to, cyclical uh collapses, which the Austrians called... the real business cycle and that was no longer sustainable once the economy has got big enough and the working class got organized enough, used all of the uh technology and social relationships developed by capitalism to challenge it. oh we can't just let the economy collapse every 20 years and then tell everybody tough shit, we didn't find enough gold rocks to fucking help any to prevent anyone from starving, it's like you can tell. people that when they're a scattered bunch of uh of yowen and and recent immigrants, but once you have like the coordinated uh working class movement with organs of power like labor unions and and political parties, oh shit, and the ability to fucking pull a trigger finger, pull uh, pull a trigger finger and or and wheeld a gun, all of a sudden you got to do something, you have to do something, and out of that necessity to find a new modus forvendi for like the theology of capitalism, you get canes. who says okay, actually it's not a sin to determine the money supply, we can determine the money supply, but when we say we, it has to be central banks, it has to be uh uh capitalist class, because they are the ones, they're the only ones who have the sufficient information to make decisions of this kind of magnitude, and of course that assumption rests on the perpetuation of class rule, like that's the thing. like all the things that that make this all sadly inevitable uh are are assumed are the assumed transcendence of these things that we can't even conceive of getting rid of and so you get central bank independence and you get uh this new dual mechanism of uh pressing the button uh pressing the uh the interest rate button up and down determining money supply and basically keeping a steady flow of of capital that creates a consistent overtime, stable conditions of growth, not the wild cycles that had predominated before, which is going to prevent the very revolutionary situation that they're all terrified of. uh, but again, it was all, it was all premised on colonial super profits and America being the consumer and producer of first result or of uh of first and last resort. and when that relationship changes, it had to to accommodate the reality of of, other capitalist economies coming into their own, is spokes and nodes in the system, uh, it wildly destabilized the situation, and the only way to prevent to the reforms that would have had to have happened along the kensian road towards youthization of the rentier class as they imagine would have meant direct conflict with capitalism and and its manifestation in state power, there were no horses for that by that point, the horses had left the stable because of keinsianism's very success, now you've got plenty of people in America who come from you, the the the populist tradition without a rooting in materialism, who do really do believe like absolute fairy stories about America as like a transcendent concept, not like... do not understand that like even if these things have meaning, it's all socially constructed, they do believe in like a transcendent American value, and the constitution is having transcendent American values, you know, and that's the kind of like reactionary populism that emerges when you don't have, well organized working class, and there's plenty of these people who want to end the fed and go back to the gold standard, because they've seen what financialization of the economy is done in the last 30 years, they're horrified by it rightly, but they also share the same underline. premises the liberals, which is the class rule is inevitable, and in fact preferable and necessary. but because they're not aware of the way these systems depend on each other, they have a fantasy that is just allowed to persist because it's politically useful to people who will get these idiots to vote for republicans uh that they can fantasize one day we're going to end the fend and get rid of the of central banking even though everything that you claim to love about capitalism depends on it, but then the liberals are left sputtering and and and gawking and not knowing what to do either until they all decided all right, well you know what, there's nowhere to go, capitalism is the real god, we can only serve it, and meanwhile the actual regulators and central bankers, they have no ideology, even though a bunch of them are like in rand fianatos and like supposedly hardcore libertarians and friedmanites like uh allen Greenspan, they take for granted that the state will be intervening in the economy, that that's the only way to make neoliberalism work, you can't have a financialized speculative economy, unless you have guarantees of state intervention to prop up industies and and um pump in liquidity when there's a crisis. in fact, what this chapter is about, chapter nine, rule of law, governing globalization, is the process whereby uh, the US regulatory state went from trying to prevent crisis from occurring in the kents, you know, intervening to stop an overheating of the market. now the market depends on overheating, that's the only way that it's like, it's an engine that's really long gas, it's literally running on fumes, these bubbles are the only thing that will keep it moving forward, because its engine has been removed, uh, so that means now you can't prevent crises, the the the role of the state is to uh intervene afterwards in crises. and of course that gives uh in those crisis, capital is able to determine the rules for all these countries that have been resisting American capitalism in one way or another all through the 20th century, so the main mechanism that is used uh to pry open these small, these middle and lower class uh um income countries uh is trade treaties, WTO, the IMF and specifically, it's part of it is trade treaties like Nafta where it's like you know groups integrating, but mostly it is bilateral trade treaties, this is it, like it's not one big trade network made up of uh of like a UN of trade, it is individual relationships between the United States government and specific other governments, which of course makes sense that that's how it would work if we conceive of global capitalism as hub and spoke situation, which is what it is, if that's the case, then uh, you're only, you're going to everything's going to have to run through Washington, so all these traities now are put in place, which uh, they operate by first absorbing in the near term all of the dislocation of creating free trade between you know the US and a country that's got much lower wage costs, by having American uh employment take the hit, basically because we could afford to, we had other ways to kind of make it up to people in the short term, to make them imagine that you, oh we're not having a tremendous step backward in quality of living, uh, no, we're still in control of our destiny, uh, but they use the uh political threat of protectionism as a leverage point to kind of get these countries to pry open their markets, they were able to go to these and say, look, we love free trade, but if we keep getting hammered on this stuff, if you uh, eventually our um, our voters are going to demand tariffs, or you could open your markets and we could tell our people, hey, now we get to trade there, and we get to send our stuff to them, uh, and that really helped grease the wheels, although for the most part, there wasn't a lot of resistance, like we talk about how this is an imposition on these foreign countries, it is, it's certainly an imposition on their people, none of whom would have voted for any of this, none of them wanted it, it was not in their best interest in the near or long-term, but their ruling classes were unified in their demand for access to us capital and markets. that was how the the the people who are already rich, already capital holders in these countries were going to in this new competitive framework be able to make money, it's the only way, because again, the other the alternative to this is democratic. control the economy, which runs directly counter to their interests, no, demoralize the working class, hyper-exploit them, and then be basically the middle man between US capital, and your supply of resources in labor, and since capitalism is pretty much in the drivercy politically everywhere, these these people relatively enthusiastically adopt this new trade regime, and uh what these, what's embedded in these treaties are legal structures, legal theories that are marginal things in American jurisprudence, aren't even accepted as uh as legal fact. in America, but are now inscribed legally in uh pretty much every governing uh policy uh thanks to the it's being written into these treaties again going around democracy saying hey, you can't vote to do this, you can't vote to do that to your economy, because private property is transcendent of all other uh rights, which again this is a religious thing based on that. religious belief and in hierarchy, the need for it, and uh, its expression through property ownership. And one of the main, legal theories here that is imposed in these treaties is the notion of regulatory takings. Now, we've already seen how uh, a big part of globalizing capitalism was making it so that countries would not expropriate for an investment, they couldn't just say, the government wouldn't just say, hey uh, that's ours now, that bank's ours now, that that mine is ours, because that's going to keep capital from coming in if they think they're going to lose it, so you already seen a huge decline in expropriation in the 80s as as these countries were sort of disciplined by their need to access the the market, but regulatory takings took that even further and said actually uh, not only can you not excorporate, it's always, always the assumption is you can excorporate if you pay like the the the worth of the item, which is never going to be worth it for anybody to do, because the the rate is just set too high cuz it's set by them, they get to say how much a thing is worth, so that means they always set it above what you can pay, so practically you can't excorporate with that rule, but there's in addition, there's a reading that says any regulation on the economy that you have as a... country that might take profits from, not even excorporating their actual capital, it might reduce their profits going forward, also has to be compensated for, because you are taking from their firm through regulation, and this is like I said, it's a it's a marginal legal theory that had uh, it's support in American Jurisprudence was shockingly, as you'd imagine, it was big during the guilded age, then it went away, it became a fringe doctrine during the the great uh during the new deal and post war era and then in the 80's presto comes back and becomes imposed everywhere as a legal concept, this is a thing that is only present in American law and is now internationalized without anybody voting for it, and what this means is now you got all these trade networks that are all being uh regulated with these treaties and those treaties have to be arbitrated because there will be conflict. and so the main uh institutional uh enforcer of this new regulatory regime is the bank of international settlement which arbitrates on a allegedly impartial basis between states and uh and corporations basically uh and you know this is classic bourgeois justice claims to be disinterested third party actually made up of US and UK lawyers who are full amashed in the revolving door between finance and government service uh and they dominate what is called the arbitration community, all these arbitrators for these institutions who are all essentially working for US capital and therefore are able to create a corpus of rulings of arbitration that substantially and consistently favors capital against democracy basically. Now this newly volatile system still needs uh some sort of regulatory structure because yes we're now accepting that uh huge crashes are going to happen cyclically and that the government's job is going to be to uh stop the contagion by dumping in liquidity and nothing else uh but if people are going to start speculating wildly they have to be able to know what where their money is going and so this uh risk management uh assessment risk assessment becomes what uh stands in for actual regulation, the only real regulation now is that certain securities require a degree of of... like a price like a assets to to um price, basically they have to have a certain percentage of the money they're lending out in reserve to cover the loss and they create a sliding scale uh which grades these uh these instruments according to how much uh collateral essentially is is is still in reserve uh with the institution making it uh are not. It's not collateral, I'm fucking, it's a ratio basically of of money you have to money you're lending out, margin requirement uh, and the the more the safer they are, the the less leverage they are, basically uh, and but this, and that's set in an international level, but then when you know it, the international standard is only applied to small domestic banks in emerging economies, the big. multinational conglomerate banks essentially get to regulate themselves, they create a they uh independent rating agencies are created which are funded directly by the big banks, so they are essentially able liquidity cap, thank you, they are essentially able to dictate the and determine their own rating uh for their own instruments, which is of course we know ended up being disastrous for the house. market in uh the auts because the the the the issuers of the bonds or the mortgage back securities were buying the rating, but the smaller banks, the uh, the banks in smaller developing countries, they have to uh, they are disciplined by this uh, like actual standard on the international market, it's the two track justice. system that guarantees that capital will win, and the will use the American state to enforce that uh victory over any social formation anywhere, nation, state or otherwise. so the other thing that is uh needed though, to to uh pin this whole thing down, is the monetary policy that can be depended upon uh? because we've talked about how the government is the state's role in maintaining capitalism is in determining the money supply uh, because that is something that cannot be privatized, private money is impossible, so it is where the private and it's the nexus point between our uh fake division between private and and public, that's why it's so dice, and that's why so many reaccionaries are fixated on the gold standard because it removes the, it it pushes back the abstractions, like this is literally beyond our control, money comes from how much gold we have, we don't make that, of course us deciding that gold is what money is is the choice, that's what determines the pool, but we get to pretend it's the actual amount of gold that determines it, there and there's this right-wing fixation on it, because it resolves that contradiction, liberals of course are more happy to uh wallow in contradiction uh and so they're happy. to sit there in the nexus like good lutherans uh between private and public because they understand they can't afford the illusion that these things are separate, they just think that it's still natural because they have a deeper transcendent relationship to capital than even sort of the lumping populist reactionary does uh and so what these countries in these new uh emerging markets that are now connected to hub and spoke style to the US supply chains and and and money markets is uh central bank independence, because we got rid of the gold standard, it's not coming back, but we need an artificial constraint that is not accessible by democracy to determine the money supply, and what that means is a push to demand as part of all the package of structural adjustment regulations and reformations that that go into any creation of a neoliberal economy in these uh they were going to have to promise basically not to print money if things go bad to have a central bank tasked with the same thing that the central bank in uh that the US federal reserve is task with low keeping inflation low and so what is presented and pushed as an attempt to create independent central banks for all this country is in effect actually creating a franchise model where all of these central banks are essentially uh branch offices of the US federal reserve, because they will as policy, as ideology, as theology. uh follow the dictates of the federal reserve, and it is that guarantee uh that that uh gives the incentive for capital to start flowing to these countries, like that was the condition for, many people might know know this, but some of you might not, the condition that the uh africaner government uh extracted from mandela and the ANC to abolish apartide was central bank. independence, they needed to assure that if they gave up the reigns of democracy that they would maintain the actual control over the economy, because if they didn't have that, then there would be an attempt to actually, there would be at least a pressure from below to actually democratize the economy, which could not be allowed to happen, and of course you can, you can even squint hard enough and see that action as... as uh not just grubby self-interest, because I guarantee you those scumbag africaners, you get them drunk enough to be like, look, even if they could do it, it won't matter, because if you try to do it, you'll get crushed, you will be destroyed, capital will flow out of your country, you'll never get it back, and you can look at what happened in Zimbabwe in the late 90s, early auts. for what would have happened in South Africa if they had not accepted its central bank independence, so they could even tell themselves they were doing the right thing, not even just for their faction or for you, the white africaners, uh, or the white south africans, all basically all Africaners are white, um, they can imagine, I'm saving the country from disaster, because if a US is there. fucking uh punish you, it will, if if money can flow out of your economy when you try to socialize economic activity, it will, and there's nothing you can do to get it back, that is why Piquetty and others have said, the only way that you're going to deal with a global inequality or rain in private capital is with international standards, international minimum tax rates, like uh global capital controls, basically. to prevent money from just moving around, because otherwise every independent nation state, no matter if it's governed by communists or populist reactionaries who are going to fix everything by creating like haronvolk democracy, their efforts to socialize the economy will be disciplined out of effectiveness. same thing happened with Venezuela, and of course that's what makes it so infuriating when people point to places like, Zimbabwe and Venezuelan sa look, this is why socialism doesn't work, and it's like, yes, motherfucker, because it is, it presents as an existential threat to the system, and it initiates a white blood cell attack from outside of it, so this new regime of liberalized economies and and capital flows, it it has one big obstacle and that is government corruption, now of course, as we know, the reason that the west isn't corrupt is because the actual corruption is just legalized, we we have we have settled, we've tamed the corruption that we used to have in the 19th century, and the thing is is that money over time will uh will team corruption, because people will grow up benefiting from a system and therefore have faith in it and and desire to see it uh perpetuated, which they understand is undermined by by corruption. individuals act because they have no faith the system is going to benefit them, which is why in emerging democracies and in and in uh crisis ridden economies, corruption is endemic, because there's no reason to trust the system at all, so by these guys own lights, none of these systems would actually give the sort of broad-based uh um the broadbased uh prosperity. that they were promising if people were corrupt, but the thing is, the only people who are going to go along with gutting their countries economies and destroying every mechanism for democratic accountability of the economy, are going to be uh motivated by money, what else is going to motivate them, they don't have a religious faith in this shit, they haven't been conditioned in it, in the soviet, when when the Soviet Union fell, the US had this remit, we're going to create a non-corrupt government that is going to dismantle... all uh public ownership and and watch the uh standard of living of their fellow citizens collapse down a fucking seward who is going to do that out of noble fucking urges, who is going to do that out of uh out of uh nobility of the heart? yeah, a few like totally brainwashed randy and ideologis, but most people are only going to do it if it benefits them in the very near term because they know that they're fucking destroying the fucking foundations of their own uh social order, they just don't care, and that happened in every fucking country that - the struggling and uh post communist and and uh post-colonial. that had to accept these structural adjustments, the only people agreeing to do it in these countries are fucking crooks and then, oh no, there's no broadbased, there's no broad based prosperity, of course, the neoliberals will talk about oh reducing poverty uh in the in the 20th century, all in China, all in the last 30 years, nowhere else, little bit, but mostly stagnant if not declining everywhere else, oh that's because of corruption, we didn't want that. but corrupting, corrupt officials are the only ones are going to carry out your policy, so there's this fake share of imposing anti-corruption measures on these countries, but that's just to get PR to reassure the markets, to pat them on the back and say your money is safe there, but because you know corrupt people are at the end of the day uh disciplined by the dollar disciplined by the deepest pocket, there's no worry that they're going to go against the greater. of capitalism and the US actually used anti-corruption as uh an excuse for why they did not offer a uh bailout uh to Russia when they had a uh economic crisis in the late 90s uh along with a bunch of other countries and we'll talk in the next chapter talks about it and we'll end talking about Russia. and and why they were different than all the other uh big countries, big crisis countries that got hit in the 90s by financial panics. but the stated argument was you're not doing enough anti-corruption, which is hilarious. the only person who would have done what Yelson did, sell his country down the river for global capitalism that he could not have believed in, is cuuse he's a fucking drum drunk scumbag cuuse... is a pirate, that's the only person you're going to get to do that job, poor gorbachov, poor pure believer Gorbachov had to go down the shoot, he wouldn't have been corrupt, but to tough shit, he wouldn't have done it, he got pushed out to the fucking door because he couldn't recognize the moment, you either had to fight that thing or you had to submit to it, and the only ones fighting were the delusional communists who got shelled out of the duma by uh by Yelson and his coo. and everybody that he got on his side both in the cou and then in the 96 reelection was bought and paid for by US dollarss and that's why starting in the late 90s Russia drifts out of the American orbit because it's just not working, the the benefits aren't accruing to capitalism uh to for its perpetuation in the country, so it becomes a gangster state ruled over by an oligarchy because those are the only people give a shit, what is this person doing? someone's having a stroke in the stream, can you get rid of that person? can you, can you delete these? okay, good, was that uh, was that portuguese? look like it was portuguese, but i don't know. okay, so chapter 10, new imperial challenge. managing crisis, as we said, they got out of the regulating game, they got out of the crisis aversion game, now they're firefighters, global capital systems, uh, central banks treasury departments exist to pump in liquidity after a crash, prop back things up, keep the fucking drunk staggering around uh so that you can keep charging its credit card, because this is crisis mode capitalism, that's all we have left this crisis, because we've jettisend any uh democratic accountability. control direction uh intervention in this thing, so that means it's it's straight into the side of the wall at 100 miles an hour. so as I said, what this we have this new paradigm, disaster capitalism for all, the system depends on overheating, then you have this moment to uh intervene from the point of... further deregulations, further financialization of the economy, necessary now, if you want to get the money, and of course what's perverse about this, all the crisis I'm talking about now, and and all the crisis that have been in the 20th, 21st century sense, we talk about them as bailouts, and of of these countries, right, like we're going to talk about uh the bailout of Mexico in 94, and then the Asian crisis, none of that, and then, but then going in the 20th, 21st century, the pigs. none of those bailouts were to the people of those countries, the money did not go into uh the budgets, the money went to their creditors, the money just went to banks. all they did was reduce what they owed on a ledger, did nothing to actually stimulate the economy at a demand level, which is why they've languished and they continue to languish. the kensian response, hey, demand side stimulus is now off the table, because we have too much, we have to, you can print tons of money, the MMters are right about that, but where it goes is politically determined, and it can only go up, it can only go to the top, it can only go to in the form of liquidity at the top to the finance system, it cannot go everywhere, so in the 90s uh... that meant that there are 72 crises, significant financial crisis in low and middle income countries, which is just blowing the doors off of any any of the the decades after World War II, uh, and and these were all caused by the these busts were all caused by first booms and those booms came in the form of us uh direct private investment. to the developed world that went from $170 billion dollars in a year in the late 80s, early 90s to $1.3 trillion a year uh in the in the mid-90s and that was all because uh after taming inflation in the 80s uh interest rates in the US were now much lower which sent money out of the country looking for better return and uh these developing countries with their new uh their new trade bilateral trade treaties with America their new regulatory uh regimes, their new constraints on capital flight, or capital control, they're all very appealing uh places to invest, but because this is you know uh, this is not the sort of grassroots, demand stimulation that like builds sustained economic activity, it all goes into a series of bubbles, and then those bubbles end up popping when inevitably something puts a kink in the hose of funding, and in the form of... and what happens in Mexico, which is the poster child for structural adjustment in the 80's, they do everything, they're like, thank you sir, may I have another, and that's because of the PRI, it's because after the Mexican revolution, this like clientist single party state emerged that got rid of the fear of dictatorship that had dominated Mexican politics in the in the 19th century by replacing it with this corporatis model, so this client, this client structure is very happy. to uh get us markets, get uh us funding uh, get us investment, and so it does everything it's asked of it, and everybody is just pop pat saying, look at Mexico, and then they sign Nafta, look at Mexico, they're being so good, but in the 90s, but in 94, uh, in uh, interest rates go up a little bit, and the money spigget goes the other direction and the whole thing fucking collapses and there's. a $30 billion dollar hole thrown in the mexican uh into the peso as as the pesos flee the country uh and this triggers a treasury and fed bailout of Mexico 30 billion as I said which again not going to Mexicans going to their banks the creditors that supposedly are taking a risk that is what justifies their interest um and Mexico. uh of course acceeds to even more structural adjustment in uh exchange for this money, which sees uh significant destruction of the lower classes uh of Mexican society, a huge move, this with NAFTA leads to essentially the annihilation of the agricultural economy in rural Mexico and takes millions of farmers off the land to find jobs in factories in Mexico or in the United. or word of work in the United States. of course, this is the context is always forgotten when talking about immigration that like this is not just a bunch of people making independent decisions, this is the result of and this and or their moral like, oh, they're breaking the law, they're bad people. uh, it is, it is just a title uh flow caused by uh this massive restructuring of the Mexican state that cut subsidy, uh, cut direct, employment, and also brought in highly subsidized American agricultural product. to destroy the margins of independent farmers, but growth, economic growth in Mexico, up up, nafta boosts exports, so it's a success it worked, the next big crisis is uh in Asia, so in the early 90s people are saying, look at Mexico, they're doing great, they also you see people talking about the Asian tigers, these economies in uh in in uh Asialy kind of racist thing to say, hey look at those oh those Asian economies they're all like tigers uh and it's South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, and what's happening here is it's a similar relationship to Japan, these countries have a similar economic relationship to Japan as Mexico does the United States, you've got a similar situation, low interest rates in Japan, cheap yen, that means easy credit to loan for to uh, to high margin speculative investments in specifically Thailand uh but also uh to a lesser extent South Korea and and Indonesia uh and then but of course again creates a bunch of uh speculative bubbles including in Thailand a huge real estate bubble where the army officers who basically run the economy there uh get in bed with Japanese uh investors to just build a bunch of housing uh and hotel. and stuff and then all has to happen is Japan makes noises about raising their uh interest rate and the it starts a chain reaction that goes through all through Asia uh and the US essentially suborns Japan into playing the same role with those as with Thailand as we played with Mexico and they didn't want to do it uh but we said no like this is how this works you are. our main uh client here in East Asia have been since the war, you are carry out our remit here, which means you're you have a role as a node with another with a role related to these other nodes, so Japan and the IMF uh, they do a bail out of Thailand, once again bailing out the the just giving money to the banks that loaded it to them, uh, and in exchange for structural adjustment, uh, in Indonesia, Suharto. who had been put in power largely by the US in the 60s to stop Indonesia from going communist, killed a million people in the process, the success story of the cold war, bigger bigger, people talked a lot about Guatemala and Iran, those were all koos, those were all you cous in more sense than one for the CIA, but Indonesia is the crowning jewel, um, but you know, live by the sword, die by the sword, like he was a US puppet, his entire career, that's who he depended on, and uh, the tide turned, we let him hang out to dry and let him get overthrown uh and imposed an IMF structural adjustment that devastated the indonesian economy, very similar thing happened with uh in the Congo, Zair as it used to be called with mabutu who we put in there to uh neutralize lamumba and who by the 90s had been uh totally delegitimized uh and the economic conditions and uh the war in Rwanda next door. destabilized them and we we we sent them packing and of course when we send these guys packing marcos same thing happened in the 80s we all we pat ourselves on the back that like yeah we're stop we're getting rid of dictatorship when we're just we're firing uh we're firing an associate who's not working out now Korea has another has also has a big crisis what's interesting there is that you even though the Korean working class is as beaten down as any of those uh any of any... in in Asia after World War II, you, Korea was ruled by a a right-wing dictatorship during most of the post-war period, that only recently the 80's got in democracy, what quote, was still able to carry off a huge general strike, obviously, not not the big strike that overthrows the state, but something that certainly rocked people in Korea and seriously uh spook potential investors uh in Korea who were terrified now that uh the south korean government was going to come out of control, especially when a left-wing activist sort of uh tangentilly associated with the strike was elected president, and what happens is the same thing we've seen before uh some uh with meter on guy gets in mandated the shariza same thing gets in mandated the people to stand up to capitalism gets the talk understands the real consequences of going against the demands of the IMF and the US government what that would mean for their economy what that would mean for their prospects uh their democratic prospects and uh they discipline the working class. they they accepted a huge job losses, they cut this the already thread bear safety net uh, because there was no alternative, um, now this is this, the Asian market crisis triggers a big crisis in Russia, and here the money stops flowing, here there is no uh bailout, essentially because Russia wouldn't play along with America's demands, because they didn't have to, because they actually had independent power in the form of their vast nuclear arsenal uh, and that meant that Russia defaulted on their on their debt, and that really is 98, when you see the breach, buse Russia is is brought in as like a corrupt client state with Yelson, but then by 98 when Putin's getting in there, the cracks are appearing uh, and Putin is going to take the US take... Russia out of US orbit because at that point he and the other uh people it like positions of power in Russia understood that subborning themselves fully to the dictates of American Capitalism would lead to the same sort of uh subservient status that all these other countries had and they didn't have to accept it, they had an alternative with all the... gas and oil and their fucking missiles, they could take their own path, and they havent ever since and we have been punishing them ever since, we've been expanding NATO like crazy, we you know did bringsmanship, we got the war we wanted uh in in Ukraine, we're hoping in the long-term to finish the job of buck breaking Russia, and they're resisting, but of course you know there's people who want to make them hindu heroes for that, but it is just this sclerotic corrupt national bour. trying to maintain their power, their narrow control, it is not any kind of resistance to regimes of domination, it is simply a uh a decentralized one that they want to maintain control over rather than be turned into total handmaidens of Washington, so there's two sides to this new quote on quote regulatory regime uh and it's uh these bailouts, this guarantee that if shit goes hits the fan, there will be uh a spigget of money to keep liquidity going, uh, but that has to be matched with a new legal regime that accelerates speculation and encourages monopoly capital formation uh, because again, growth now is determined and uh by speculation, if you do not have maximum accelerating speculation, you don't have an economy, you don't have capital circulation, and of course that's incredibly destabilizing, which is why the bailouts are there, so everybody can keep playing the game and not have to worry that they're going to go off a cliff because the the daddy fed will be there to protect them in their ever everlasting arms. and part of that means the final end to Glass Steigle any sort of uh partition between commercial banking and investment banking, everybody gets to invest, everybody gets to uh have their securities, everybody gets to have derivatives, it's a derivative revolution they call it, you get a derivative, you get a derivative, you get a derivative, more derivatives we make, the more we can circulate the the uh uh capital, the more we can uh compensate for the decline in actual product. of the economy, the real one that this is all supposed to be based on, and part of this derivatives revolution is this amazing third way clinton triangulation that you got to actually admire for how elegant it is, so clinton has you know this remit with Afrikan Americans and minorities as part of the Democratic coalition, he wants to, they do have like an interest a actual like narrow political interest in seeing them advanced so that they'll vote for them, and that means making uh home ownership accessible to people who were denied a chance to get in on the lottery of the gi bill in the post war uh uh cheap financing, direct financing, now there's no more gi bill, there's none of that, that's all, that's all an extinct political economy, but what we can do is financialize mortgages to facilitate lending, if you allow the creation of these mortgage securities, you minimize the risk of lending money to any specific person, which means people who systemically and structurally have less wealth because they were denied access. can now have access to credit, and for people already have a home uh, they find that thanks to the mortgage interest rate deduction that allows you to deduct uh the interest you pay on your mortgage, not the actual mortgage, but the interest uh from your from your... is it allows you to uh borrow money against your home's equity at a lower rate than is posted basically a special subsidized cheap rate and then that uh stimulates consumer spending and compensates for the lack of wage increases buse remember wages stop rising in 1980 basically but people have to spend more over time and so cheap credit for mortgages uh subsidized by the by this tax code allows for access to the credit that will allow people to to do that spending, and of course because they're borrowing it, it means that they are not free, that they're digging their own fucking grave, the they're paying for their own prison, but there is no alternative, if you can only express yourself, you can only express your identity and your uh spiritual self-conception through consumption, then you have to so uh and honestly the most horrifying thing in this chapter and this is really like a this is a love crafty and realization uh so he they talk at the end of this chapter about Brooksley born anybody who watched like the any of the frontline shows about the uh about the crash in 2008 i think she was in the one of the alex gibney movies too uh she was the cassandra uh who was uh in the clinton administration, the regulator who was saying like, if we stop regulating this stuff, it will blow up, she was telling everybody that uh, and Larry Summers and those guys, they all patted her head and told her to go away, and you know, it was sexism played a role, of course, uh, and they were all bought and paid for wall street stugies, but once again, just like with the uh Africaners negotiating the end of apart time, they had an they had a story to tell themselves that made. uh getting rid of regulation even knowing that it's going to cause a crisis uh as the smart and only and correct an adult move, because this new economic paradigm, this financialized economy requires maximum flow, which means the lightest amount of friction in transactions, because again we're talking about, that's the only way to keep it to keep the uh accelerated. again this appeal to a fantasy notion of a true natural market that reveals the invisible hand of God, that's that's the invisible hand of the market, it's whose hand is that, it's gods, and this is where once again we get to the theological basis for this stuff, these are all, these are all theologies, it's like that's not, that's why it's been all to even say it, to say something. of course it is, all this is an extension and a trans and a materialization of of theology, the question is which theology are we going to fucking live by, the one where our separation is eternal and existential, the one where we are hostage to idiot psychotic god, or the one where we are fundamentally connected, and that and through connection can come to mutual understanding, sufficient. to direct our actions, and I think the evidence is we do have that capacity, but that capacity obviates the necessity for class rule in a way that. our rulers will simply not allow to happen. i really do think that you need hell, like hell exists as a concept to justify class rule. the notion that some are damned and some are saved, that there is like some eternal place of torment or or reward. that that that raises the stakes right of life so dramatically that it necessitates structures to enforce codes of behavior and ideas, because if you don't you will lose people, but what if there's nothing to lose? not that there is no heaven, not that there is no hell, but that we are all saved by virtue of being human, if that's true, then we can make mistakes, and we don't have to rely on alienated institutions to enforce orthodoxy of any kind, but again that has to come from outside, no system is going to come to it the realization, like all those good cansianisms, cansians in the 60s and 70s, they didn't say, oh, I guess we have to go to war with... capitalism now, we thought we could have reform, but it turns out we have to go to war, no, they submitted, because they wanted to think they were good people, they wanted to think they were moral and were trying to lead people to their some sort of post scarcity promise land, but that was all a delusion, that was all self talk, they were handmaidens of capitalism the entire time. and of course the irony is is that this insistence on uh, patrolling hell, creating creating a a a a system that uh, you know, separates the saved from the dammed and rewards the saved and and punishes the damn, which is what we imagine we're creating with our economic systems, whether we're liberals or democrats, oh what's actually happening, you're literally turning earth into hell, earth is turning into a... i i hate to use the word, but god damn it, it's one of the best terms coined in the 21st century, a go hell, and and anyone honestly, who cares if the book is gibirish, if anyone knows about geo hell, uh, the book is gibrish, who cares, book, being able to... encapsulat a concept that uh pithily is, that's a real, that's a real uh achievement and I salute, salute, but yeah, we're turning earth into hell, in our pursuit of heaven, what a joke, what a cosmic joke, and a cosmic shame, that's a cosmic shame, that's a cosmic shame. That's a cosmic shame, folks, cosmic shame, isn't it? I should rename this that, now never mind, all right, see you guys, so next week, don't know what date yet, but next week we'll do ch uh, part 11, or no, I'm sorry, part six, part six, the global capitalist millennium, yeah, that's right, welcome to them, the willennium, the 21st century where it gets real carry real quick and where every fairy tale these people told themselves throughout the 90s gets uh woken up from and then new and even more fantastical uh vehicles for delusion are forged bye bye
