 shit, there we go, there I am. hello, how do you joke? folks, how do you jokes? how do you jokers? how do you tokers? howy midnight smokers? getting your loving on the run. uh, sure don't want to hurt no one. one of the worst songwriters in American history, the opposite of Bob Dillan. Steve fucking Miller. So. so today I wanted to start by talking about special effects in movies, because someone tweeted today that they were uh that they had watched me recommend the blob remake, the uh 80s blob remake with uh, I believe Kevin Dillan, Jeffree Demon uh, uh, written by Frank Deribont and they said that it was great, and they were glad they did, and I got to have a little bit of a a chat online. about the wondrousness of the 80s si-fi remakes, all of which are great uh, but which I think a blob is honestly the by far the most underrated one, and I think in in argument really for the best, it's that one or the thing in my opinion, and it's close, it might be a twin flip in my opinion, um, and of course one of the things that make both those movies great is practical special effects and all the things special effects are pretty well-known, they're sort of the gold standard people. always talk about the thing, but i really feel like the blob might even have more impressive special effects and it doesn't get talked about nearly as much. the blob in that movie is this, it doesn't eat people the way the jello mold Steve McQueen blabay people, it dissolved people and you could see through it, you could see people being eaten and by the acidic blob, and they showed it, they showed people having their faces melted off on scrama, they saw the guy get pulled down entire body pulled down through a fucking uh uh garbage disposal and it's also very nasty, it's like it's willing to kill children uh, it has very funny uh Reagan of politics because the blob obviously the original 50s movie, people took that at face value, this is about communism, big red blob coming to get everybody uh, you could also say no, it's actually anti-communinism, no it's actually 50's 50's conformity, whatever uh any way you slice it, it was pretty uh, the surface was certainly supposed to be anti-communism, it's red. It's a big red blob, come on, uh, but even the surface text of the blob remake is very like pissed off, 80s, left in exile, because instead of the blob being an alien uh creature, the blob is actually the result of a US government experiment uh by carried out by the military to create a super weapon, uh, and when the government scientists come up, come around, they're willing to kill everybody, alert, although it's it's not really part of the, it doesn't really matter, kill everybody uh to preserve it, and then another bad guy is like this holy roling preacher played by Dell Close who founded the Chicago uh Chicago Second City, I believe, it's like it's the classic Regane left-wing boogyman of the military industrial complex and uh evangelical protestantism, but anyway very good movie uh and this practical effects are a big reason why and it's... the whole the classic CGI uh practical effect argument, practical effects are better, and then people say no, CGI is more versatle, and the thing is is that on the question of practical versus CGI, I would actually say that that is, you could that could be boiled down to a matter of taste, um, because as much as I might be a practical fuck guy, because I grew up with them, I'm an analog guy at the end of the day, I'm Oregon trail generation, I'm I remember getting. so that means i'm not a digital native, so that means that i have a certain expectation of presence on screen, whereas kids grow up on video games, which all are all CGI, and then cartoons and stuff, much more, and then of course everything online that's all smoothed out, it doesn't, they're not missing what I'm missing, and so you know, okay, and in addition to that, there's a genuine uh tradeoff because one of the problems with practical effects is movement. fluidity, it's very hard to make a practical effect look like it's moving across a room, how do you create something that's like a robot, most of those robots and stuff they have you know limits to how far they can go because they're not full automatons, that's the technology that's it's too much, it's unnecessary, uh, you can, you can cheat, but it looks like it's cheating a little bit, like that's where that's where stop motion comes in, that's where green screens, all of these things don't look perfect, whereas the promise of CGI is pure fluidity of motion, now you can say, well, I don't like fluidity of motion, and I don't care about fluidity emotion compared to concrete sense, uh, sense of presence on screen, I say amen, but I will acknowledge that there are people, especially younger people, for whom that distinction doesn't matter, and they like the fluidity of CGI. So I'm willing to write that off as uh, just generational and aesthetic, but there is one thing that I will not, and that is CGI gunshots and blood splat. CGI bullet holes going into people, and then blood coming out of people from shot, from being shot. Uh. in my opinion that is not a question of generation, it's not a question of uh aesthetic preferences. CGI blood and gunshots look bad, they are inferior in a meaningful objective or close to objective sense, and what I mean by that is this: for now, CGI blood and blood and gunshots and this is not objection, this is not something that's arguable, I don't think don't look real. they don't look real, that's not, I don't think that's a thing you have to like argue with somebody with, even even a damn zomer, I think the argument would be, what differences does it make, just like it is with that CGI creature uh doesn't look real, well it can move on screen, which like a puppet couldn't, uh, to which I say no, in a horror, all bets are off, but in action, it is paramount, like the point of showing blood coming out of somebody when they get shot in an ac. scene is to see what is as close as possible to the image of a human being being shot with a gun, that's what establishes the stakes in action films, that's what we're there to see, we were there to see damage being done to characters to enjoy the visceral as in gut-based satisfaction of seeing violence done to somebody who isn't me, which is a deep lizard thing in people um and also to establish stakes for what will happen to our character. is who we love, hopefully if the good, if the good is the movie is good, and I would say that CGI blood and bullet wounds do not look that way, and therefore they cannot fulfill the role that gunshots in an action movie are supposed to do, they can't do it, they can't do the job, and that means that they are inferior inherently, that's my take on that, and I don't, I say, I can't argue, you can argue, but that you're wrong, that's one of those red lines, like I'm all about you, it's all about. there's no binaries until you get to 51%, you know, and I'm way past 51% on this one, I'm near 100% on this one, um, but yet, fewer and fewer films, feature squibs and blood, even big budget hollywood movies, that's crucial here, uh, it's not technically a question of cost, big movies could technically uh, afford squibs and that is why for a long time I yelled at movies that didn't use squivs because it felt like they were cheeping out on purpose, and I've had a... creeping realization lately, especially i saw after i saw the five bloods, the new spike lee movie on Netflix, and it used all not only CGI bullet wounds, but CGI gun flashes, they didn't uh the punisher series on Netflix did that too, they didn't even put blanks through the fucking mag, they just went afterwards and put in flashy lights at the end of the fucking guns uh and it was awful like and they had to pretend to have recoil like all the actors they the gun wasn't firing so they didn't... they didn't have like actual recoil at all, they had to pretend, it was like bang bang, it was like kids playing dress up, and i was like, how could spikely of what this happened, but i think what i've done what's dawn on me, especially seeing like a movie by a real movie maker, not some fucking hack that was like that is that i don't think that that, i think we've reached the point on squibs that we reached with CGI a while ago where these are not questions that are being raised anymore, you know it's like when when when likely signs on a direct a movie, at no point is there a discussion about whether it's going to be in color or other than unless he's got a hair up his ass, or like whether it's going to be shot on digital, unless you have a specific hair up your ass, those things are all assumed, yeah we're going to use digital cameras buse those are cheaper, uh, well use CGI, we'll use uh, where we can, we'll use green screens, that's built in, there's and I'm feared, I'm afraid now that we have reached the point where bull gunshots, which are objectively inferior, uh CGI shots have been baked into the new understanding of where the budget goes, and that to me is awful and depressing and sucks, because i don't know if i'm... going to see any good action movies anymore. I every time I see an action movie now I'm just holding my breath for the first gunshot and then I either turn it off or if it's got anything else going for it I watch it and just at the every gun every gun play scene I just get a little more deflated uh so many movies I think are really good to get undermined that when a way I can't distract myself from like the purge films for example and then but then if I see it oh my god and there are so many dog shit action films that I find myself. overrating and watching longer than i should because at least there's some fucking squibs, i mean and that's what i mean is what i mean is that it's not technically about money because like there are squibs in in movies that guys made in their backyards in the 80s like stuff on if anyone's ever watched best to the worst the red letter media you know stuff like uh get even and these weird uh vanity movies that like uh uh local real estate magnates and fucking uh uh uh karate uh uh uh what do you call it uh karate studio owners would like self fond they have fucking they have they have squibs you couldn't afford squibs but they i think it's been phased out of even even on the on the on the budgets at this point it's not an object it's not a uh unless you insist on it like i don't think tararantino's ever going to make a movie with swibs no matter what but of course he can make that argument because he is a big money his movie is uh they sell, so he gets to stake the terms, for even directors, a lot of directors don't have the ability to make those demands, and i think the reason for that is that, this is a thing where this is literally and fully the fault of capitalism, this is an example where you can see objectively the way that the artistic uh integrity of films, like any other artwork are undermined by the degree to which they have to adhere to market logic. It's a genuine case, it's like Darwin's finches, if you want to argue about capitalism destroys culture and argue that culture cannot be uh progressive in the way that liberals want it to be and think that they can make it and make that make everything good, no, it dissolves like assid all qualities, I mean obviously that means ideological, but it also just means aesthetic, it literally just means a commitment to art as as an expression of human beauty, all artist is trying to... trying to present a perfect image from the mind somehow, a crystalling connection to the unconscious and put that in the world and some form, and filmmakers try to do it with movies and if they have had it written, if it's been written out of the logic of filmmaking that you have, you can't that you uh can have to show bullshit, CGI looking blood coming out of people, you have undermined the artistic integrity of film, and the reason they do this is because it's way cheap. to use CGI uh for one reason uh CGI is compatible with the new gig economy uh neoproletarization that we're seeing or deproletarization we're seeing where uh people where the problem is that like the the the type of film economy that produced squibbs doesn't exist anymore where you had union crews. doing union jobs to to keep them happy because they were making all this money and they had to keep the fucking workers happy and so if you want to have shoot a bunch of people with squibs and have them go off so satisfying you got to have somebody rig up the clothing you got to wait around while you get set up that and then set up the shot and then if anything goes wrong uh you got to get a new wardrobe because you've ruined that one and then set up another rig and do it again, that is the compounding cost of that are tremendous, whereas you're shooting people with CGI bullets, one shot everybody falls down, you're happy with it, good, you want two for safety, go for it, but then the real work is done by fucking outsourcing it to fiver a bunch of fucking uh code jockeys working tiny trances of the job for micro payments and no fucking overtime, certainly nous. benefits, the costs are just so overtime uh uh accumulative that the logic of filmmaking has now squeezed out a genuinely meaningful craft that undergirds a certain type of filmmaking and makes it what it is, it's very very very sad, but it also shows like we've got to do this, we've got to get rid of this, and of course you libertarian will try to just say, well that's the fault of that union. These guys, these guys care more about making the reunion rate than making art, to which I say, uh, fuck you, uh, this is all because of profit, they're they're squeezing out the profit out of the tooth. to toothpaste tube and they're all responding to the declining rate of set, this all shit should be all funded by the government, this should all be fucking either publicly through like crowd funding or direct block grants from uh you know artistic institutions, this should all be fucking publicly funded, there shouldn't be any profit in it at all, so your that objection is stupid, but even if you accept that logic that well they should do it, they should do it for the love of it and they're ruining everything with their fat union contracts, it's very hot, that's why i'm sweaty, it's it's it's no longer pleasant new york, it's it's oppressively uh humid, but even if you're those guys are, even if those guys are working fiver rates instead of uh union rates, they still have to set up the shot, probably going to not do as good a job as the guys used to pay more to do it by the way, because why would they uh, and they got to supervise the work and it takes more time, and time is the most precious commodity on a film set, because the time that you're setting up a shot or dealing with a logistical issue is a time when a lot of people are not doing... anything and that is just to the capitalist the dagger to the heart, people standing around, you got time enough to lean, you got time enough to clean, and CGI gunplay, especially in action movies that are heavy with it, just streamlines the the uh uh, streamlines the uh amount of time and high to make the movie, just cuts, I don't what it would be, but it's significant, which means compounding significant amount of money is saved by not having everybody sitting around for days on end while you set up shots or people. shot with corn syrup, and the thing is is like that's that's not a problem that can be solved by doing away with cultural marxism and SJWs, it's it's not, it's not a problem that can be solved by anything other than removing the the decrepid uh code, the the the um the monster in the machine, the... It's the only way to redeem this shit, and yeah, of course people can point to good movies that still get made, a lot of the time it boils down to either luck, and happen stance, or it's just a few people, it's it's the same thing as the American economy, there's a there's a remaining hangover of people are still holding on to those last bags of money, those last chunks of ice of of the ice of the melting, the melting ice cap of post war prosperity and that applies for directors too, there are guys who are still walking around with big fucking histories of making money for people that can make that can give them the leverage to ensure that they don't fuck around with a thing like squibs, but those people are shrinking and shrinking in number and their even their leverage is is declining over time, so even if there's a few, i'm just saying treasure the the the really treasure the... the gifts when they come aesthetically because they're going to be fewer and fewer farther and farther between uh somebody pointed out the john wick movies, one of the things that makes the john wick movies just, i think i've come around to feel finding them very, i i rewatched john wick 3 the other night, i'd only seen it after once in the theaters and i was like this is not i don't like this actually, i don't like this, i officially don't like it anymore, and part of it is the fact that the plot is structured so that none of it has to happen, it's it's one of those things that is well you could have just started here at the end of the, you could have left off where the last movie did in basically the same situation, give or take, so the whole plot is pointless and you know it's obviously it's running out of maneuvers with the the choreography, they added some dogs, but the monotony of the fucking CGI blood splatter is so deadening, and they do it better than most because they don't overdo it, and they keep it dark, that helps, it hides the the clash, they don't get the... color right, they've never gotten the color right, and of course we're not talking about real blood, we're talking about movie blood, which is all you need to look like, and you know how you do that, make some fucking movie blood, it's amazing, they they can't, with all their ones and zeros, they cannot make something look like movie blood, and meanwhile movie blood, you just put some carro syrup in a fucking thing and you've got it, infuriating, so I'm not looking forward to the next one, but I'll see it out of completes. probably and you now people like to say, oh, it's tough with uh, it's tough with John wick to use squibs because there's so many headshots, one, don't have as many headshots, why does everything have to be a headshot if you have to compromise so deeply as in using CGI, maybe don't do that, uh, but also you can, it's not impossible to do headshots and have you know just a little tube, just some fucking corn syrup sprashed on the back of of the wall uh, if you've got to do CGI gun muscle flash. you can't fire a blank that close to someone's head, okay, that's a concession to just logistics, but you can still, you can still do and they don't, they don't do it, three movies, they don't do it, ah early squibs weren't great either, the thing is even a bad squib is still uh still on screen and i feel like that is still going away from the need for as i said realism is the point of bullet wounds and in uh in action films that's what makes it artistically fun and interesting uh so that's still not at the ideal but it's already by virtue of really being on a screen and and actually having like fluidity that is not obviously uncanny valley like, you're already up, you're already up, meanwhile after what 10 years now of hegemonic squibs, blood CGI squibs as bad as it ever has been, i saw i saw arms or guns aquimbo, i saw guns a kimbo retched film, absolutely wrched film, one of the things what was retched about it was the CGI blood which... mind the entire thing, but I will say this, because the whole movie is supposed to be like this one of those dumb ass critiques of like the culture of spectacle and violence, but you're not not looking at real, anything that even comes remotely close to real violence, you're looking at CGI graphics, you are it's like I'm already playing a video game, you you've lost it, you've lost your your connection to some sort of critique, um, this only works if I feel like these are real stakes, but what scares me is if that movie had used CGI, if that movie had used... wibs especially consider how much violence was in it, i probably would have raved about it, even though it's objectively terrible in every other way. i'm losing my ability to even, you know uh, feel like i'm really appreciating something or just happy to see something that's not so distractingly terrible, but those are the burdens we pair in this life, heavy as the head that eats the crayons. so what are you guys up to? oh god, something happened to birth movie's death, did they find out that uh all of those people are still Devon Ferraci under a screen name? i wouldn't be surprised, i've never seen any of them in person, who knows if those are real people? man, that is an underrated terrible site, I mean, the the the business model of that is, hey, what if we did sponsored promotion but didn't tell anybody we were doing sponsored promotion? yeah, that's great, because then you're making money no matter what, you can, you can, you're pursuing the traditional click-based ad uh strategy of regular news, a regular entertainment news, and opinion sites, but you're also getting paid under the table. by the very studios you're reviewing the films of, it's pretty impressive, it's a hell of a racket, and then the fact that it was founded by a just awful unpleasant uh uh creep, who wi hilariously tried to come back as a born again Buddhist, which is very funny for me to talk, but I wasn't being canceled when I decided to have some sort of uh spiritual experience, he essentially did the same thing that tele Evangelists who get caught didling the receptionist. and pilfering from the poorbox do, which, but because he's in California and he's amongst the libs, he can't be christianity, so it's a nice eastern religion uh, that feels worldy and and vaguely left wing, uh, so now what happened, did it collapse? how do i feel like harmony curin's movies? i'm up and down. Corren uh Gumma is really disturbing and memorable uh, I never saw Julian Donkey boy, I'll admit, I don't really like kids, um, I just saw beachbum and was kind of underwhelmed, although I really really liked Jonah Hill uh, but I and I never, but I have to say uh, I do really like spring breakers, I think that he really kind of he hit that one out of the park, he kind of grooved it, it was one of those perfect situations where he got the... the perfect mariing of subject matter and and cast especially my god franco specifically is brilliant in that uh and uh vanessa huggins is very good to and for in my money there's fewer scenes that better define pre covid late or early 20th 21st century America than the look at my shit scene, look at my shit, look at all my shit, look at my guns, look at that shit, motherfucking vampires, motherfucking vampires. Apparently you cannot just have the full clip anywhere, there is a Gregory brothers auto tune, uh, them niggas come up now huh tell you no motherfuckers come fuck with me now fucking lice their fucking asses man fucking dad i'll fuck that shit up look at my shit look at my shit i'm a fucking nightmare motherfucker i'm the motherfucking that shit dropping fucking planets i dropped that fucking black play mess on that motherfucker get my shit on my shit i got shirts, all colors, this is it, no uh, that's my favorite of his, i think that's pretty pretty universal uh opinion, i'll admit I'm not a huge malic guy, i'm not a malician, i don't really vibe, i've like some of his movies, but it's just not my, i need more of a, think i'm more of a lack. i don't know, i try to like, i kind of lyrical filmmaking is never really spoken to me, i feel like maybe it's cheating a little bit, because like mood and shit is what film is, and what like the challenge of commercial filming anyway is to shape it into something is to give it a spine and like the conflict between that, like the conflict between the art and like the expressiveness of film and its narrative structure, the artificial imposition, i think that's what's interesting, and and for with malic, i don't feel enough of that. I don't feel the gears mo turning enough, I i appreciate why people like it, it's just not for me. I like Vantrer, I have to say, uh, I, I thought that uh, antichrist is is brutal, melancholy is great, um, I... uh the first half of nimphomaniac is really interesting, the second half is very bad uh and then the serial killer movie that apparently like everyone hated except for the people who love his shit uh is now on hulu but it's only like the hour and the two and a half hour version i kind of want to see the whole thing because Netflix had the whole uncut uh nymphomaniac which is what i saw and i'd rather see the whole thing oh um dog vill is also very good i never got around the saying man way, maybe because I wasn't buying a Brice Dallas Howard, were you ever a big fan of John Carpenter? Uh, yeah, I'm thinking I am, considering I think that he might be the best film, I think he's the best filmmaker of the... 80's pound for pound, I mean it's that's a tough, that's a tough decade too, because that was commercial filmmaking at its height, because the studio system broke down just like every other like Fordist, modernist uh post-war concept in the 70s right, and then in the initial explosion of the uh of the financialized film industry, you had that that glorious moment when money was going to everybody and all these fantastic aw tours to make whatever they wanted almost uh and it was dizzying and and and and all inspiring because you had this huge flow of money in an industry that was expected that was that was used to a certain degree of... return a certain relatively modest return on investment, but then of course the gogo 80s uh, the explosion of credit, and what do you know uh, all of a sudden, and then artistically the reply, the result of that, the birth of the blockbuster, and the new paradigm, these movies can actually make a ton of money, which means they're worth investing more money in, so the movies become more larger spectacle, more impressive visually, but they also have to make more money, which means they have to be narratively more constrained in their ambition to be maximally uh acceptable to the audience and and interesting to the audience uh so the 70s is like the big bang explosion and then the stabilized new system, the 80s, the mature moment, that's where you got all the best blockbusters, that's where you've got Spielbergger is height, that's where you've got Cemekis, black to the future films, that's where you've got the best action films, Schwarznagers, phenomenal work, fucking predator die hard, uh, um, like even shit that nobody even remembers now. I mean, maybe if I look back, I would uh, it would be rose tinted glasses, but I'm willing to bet that like if I went back and watched like romancing the stone that uh, Michael Douglas, Kathline Turner, Bogian Bacal throwback, adventure movie, I bet that fucking holds up, better than anything similarly uh uh oriented in. film in cinema now, so you had Blockbuster film-making, the formula is greatest, the biggest investment and and the biggest return, but then over time what happens, the aperture slows, the money gush comes to a, it it loses its uh hydraulic power, competition rises up, shrinks, shrinks the aperture even further, and that means uh, what happens is it gets the money flow gets diverted, and now there's a small amount of money for people who want to make very small films that can be released at this point now digitally entirely and not even go to cinemas, and then films that require these massive, massive, massive budgets, because all profits in the in the era of quantitative easing and financialization, all profits have to be massive, massive, massive, there's no more reasonable expectation of return, there's only a maximum return because of maximum investment. and that means everything has to be as safe and bland and dog shit as possible, and now and now the fact that CGI is so much comprehensively cheaper than practical effects in every respect, means it's going to get smoother and blander visually and uh artistically for the same reason, it's a bummer man, it's a real bummer, so that's why we have to cherish whatever little gems we get, the remaining few directors who can who can get something made we should check. shit, i mean my god, scorsey got to make a a fucking, oh my god, he got to make a three and a half hour long meditation on regret and aging and death and materialism and and america with, i mean you want to talk about CGI, the CGI there is awful, but on purpose in a very purposeful way, in a way that it's it's breakian, that film is brechiot, and that's the kind of shit that doesn't fly in studios anymore because of the... um that risk of alienating the audience and Netflix only did it because they're still trying to now compete with cinemas and they and so the brand name of Scorsei is worth the investment which it isn't to traditional filmmaker film uh studios because it's already out there they don't need to prove to anyone anything they're already the movies there's nowhere else for him to go up above the movies what if you going to go to tv it's not the same thing we all understand it at some basic level no matter how good fucking TV got the prestige era. in my opinion it's the inferior model, it always will be because it came later, because it's more commercialized by inherently, but sometimes you'll get a thing like netflix willing to pay $200 million dollars for this corsezy brand to to bring uh eyes and and uh and uh authenticity to the to their brand, that it's it's marketing, it was a marketing expense, it was a lost leader, so we'll still get that sometimes, but it's going to be fewer and farther between, everything else is going to get shit, there's no other way for it to go, and the only way you can reverse engineer this to make sure what went wrong, there's no cultural explanation, that's nothing to do with SJWs, it's not devon froty and his hollywood pedophiles making everyone uh want to want to watch representation rather than art, it's fucking money, movies are cheaper to make now, but that the cheaper ones aren't going to get return, so they're not going to waste. on them, which means that that more than anything, honestly, even more than uh than budget, although we're at a point now where at the micro level you can't even do squibs because you're cutting out of essential stuff because of how low the budgets now are, but also where's it going to end up? this shit that just gets thrown onto fucking netflix with in a big pile, to me, some violence has been done to the artifact, i know that's stupid, but i feel like these things, the the symbolic order of meaning around art is not purely the thing itself, well the Benjamin talks about this, there's that the presence, there's the ora, that aura isn't just physical proximity and like reality, it's it's presentation. it's it's ritualized consecration, seeing something on a big screen means something and it abuse the thing you're seeing with meaning beyond what's on screen, seeing it on a little fucking tv is different and it's like well yeah but you see movies on tv too later afterwards after they have been desacralized but they were once sacred once again here we have no ritual sacralization just dump it out like as they said media like fucking uh cafeteria fried chicken and uh and uh sweet potatoes and it's there to fill out the fucking steam tray, it's it's the pile of uh of like wilted spinage in the corner just so that someone can say their spinage on the fucking buffet, then at the end of the night nobody wants it, they just throw it out and make some more. once again desacralization, we come back to desacralization, we come back to to the the the the the the um the sack. privage of ritual, the destruction of civic meaning, what i'm talking about, in favor of pure lucer, pure economic maximization of of profits and efficiency, it's bad stuff, and that is why i'm against it, that's why we got to get over it and get done with it before it's the last culture we had, was this dog shit, the fucking the the cephalopods, the fucking octopuses or whatever the fuck, they they come. they evolve their way out of the boiling seas 500 thousand years from now and like a on a planet that's had it's been completely uh retaraformed by global warming and humans like slowly slowly died out over the course of a few millennia uh and now we got the cephalopod overlaurns we got the the tentacle people and like another hundred thousand years of tentacle people we got tentacle people in their own cycle of capital accumulation and they find r and and uh our moss covered civilization and we have we have floor is lava on Netflix and I know you're saying oh it's it's it's that's it's digital one of the good things about digital is that it'll be completely gone it'll be completely wiped from the planet unlike the the the you know our our ancient history will have more reality to any future generation excavating than our digital one because all of it's effeniscent and goes off but let's just say like one server survives hypothetically and the cephalopods of the future device a way to reproduce that technology and translate it, not impossible, i mean they fucking 3d, they 3d printed the the the laarnings of a neandertholl so that they could hear what it sounded like or no, a mummy and that's it's floor is lava, has anyone seen fl is lava, i don't want to sound like Andy Rooney here, but I watched a couple episodes with a friend of mine the other night just because we were like flipping through Netflix and making fun of how bad everything looked and we were just like, this looks like the nedir and we watched it and I mean I get the appeal of that kind of thing like American Nint Warrior, the Japanese game shows are all based on and I see the appeal and I've enjoyed them, I was a kid, I liked American gladiators, but Flor is lava is like pitched so stupidly, like it's the level. of intelligence assumed of its audience is and and its compet and the people competing is so low that it can't be enjoyed by anybody who has more than a room temperature iQ because even if you're trying to turn your brain off it won't let you because it's still too slow like it's not fastpaced the way that a show uh that's supposed to just be turn your brain off fun is it's too slow for that it leaves you contemplating it and that's not the point you're not supposed to be contemplating these shows. It's supposed to be all my nards and you're like, that's funny, uh, love to turn my brain off and watch some guys getting hit in the nards, this is too slow to to accommodate that, you end up contemplating the object and it's groteskness, and that's because it's pitched to people who are so stupid that it's not too slow for them, that it's at the right speed for them, and the most telling uh uh symbol of that is that the the the announcer who's like some Naskar analyst. I guess uh, his voice over and explanation of the people as they go through the lava room, his voice is pitch like a especially stupid person, what do they expect this audience is and it's like you can say oh yeah people are always that stupid but like most for most of the history of even mass popular art they were expected to have to deal with like the pace of the... median iq, the median ability to like decode symbols, and now it's slowed, it's actually slow, because the aperture of of alienation has to widen and widen, exactly, the audience is children, because eventually you have to widen the aperture to everybody, and you can't alienate any part of that audience if you expect to lose any of it, or if you expect to keep them all. they all have to be there, and people are saying it's for kids, but I'm sorry, I watched hiddens, secrets of the hiddens temple, and I watched double dair, and those things are fast as shit, those shows were fast, they were running around, they were zipping around, they're expecting less of our children, it's a soft bidgetry of low expectations of our little rugrats. you can tell me that you can you watch an old clip of double dare or secrets of the hidden temple and tell me that it's moving at the same speed and with the same degree of condescension as floor is lava i would disagree and the thing is is that like this is not just one direction it's not just pure decline i'm not being os even though I've sounded like it, it's not pure to blind, like as as there is that infiltration of art into commerce, you remember the technology changes, technology becomes more intensified, and then leads to new arts, new ways of expression that are their own reward, I mean film itself is one of those, I mean you can argue that film and television are deform deformations of of the theatrical experience, I mean you could make the exact same argument using similar, similar lines of argumentation. that i've been making to say, no, no, real drama, it has to have a sense of presence, physical presence, my assumption that no, the presence is in the frame, that's because that's what i grew up with, so you could already argue that yeah, no, this is, this is actually not objective, this is just as emeshed as anything else, uh, but they that they, but who wouldn't give up, who would give up cinema, who would even give up television, even though most of it's dog shit, there's there's real real gems there, there's real art in every fucking facet of it, so I guess what I despare of is, and I think maybe this is a Counian thing, this is Counian incommenserability, where like because I am so wetted to certain notions of you, physical of of presence, of of presentation, of ritual in in artistic consumption, which is very, you could argue, that's all very 19th century, and not younger people don't aren't beholden the same way to that kind of stuff. the they they then you could say yeah there are new technological uh art forms emerging that are that are if they might be less artistically acute than stuff that doesn't require a lot of capital or isn't as technologically uh accelerated they have their own dimension especially and most importantly are more relevant to people living now because that they're operating in a frequency of reality in a way that older art forms are honestly not. they are antiquated, they are obsolete, so maybe I'm just like, I'm, you know, this is, this is why generations must rise and fall, this is why the the the uh, it's why the wheel of Ka has to keep turning, because uh, otherwise it staltifies, because people, there's the all those the the grinding of like expectations of like birth and and and and setting and and like the ritualized space that we inhabit, that is uh, that changes as time passes, and so people have different senses of it, but I would just say that the thing that concerns me is that you, even though technology allows that for the infiltration of money into art to diversify art in a in a productive way, I would say that the desacralization process is unidirectional, and that is a genuine decline that has to be interrupted, and that's why capitalism has to be overthrown, because there is a embedded in all of the embedded in all of the productive conflict between emerging forms of art, emerging generations with different context. they're being driven to a state of radical alienation, radical individual alienation that is anathetical art and human consciousness and human the human soul to get very very sappy about it. i've read a little bit of burrows, i read naked lunch and that was okay, it wasn't really my thing, i should dri again i did d see doctor sleep i even watched the extra long version although i really couldn't tell what was expanded uh i don't get why people like that i really don't understand though i mean i guess i like i guess people like that director but i've never i don't get that either he seems like a uh he seems like a journeyman scott flanigan he seems like it just a he seems like a George P. Castamos type guy, like just a a meet a ham and egger. i i don't get this thing where he's supposed to be a fucking autour, and it doesn't help that the book is terrible, and i do think it's funny though that the book, dr. sleep is a sequel to the shining, and then but the movie is a sequel to uh the shining the movie, because they have different endings partially because at the end of the book spoiler or the uh the overlook blows up. and it doesn't in the movie, the shining, and so and both of them end at the side of the overlook, and so that changes the whole ending, um, but no, I mean Rose the Hat is not scary at all, I mean the jokes right themselves, looking like a little affair trying to fucking suck people's steam out uh, I mean uh, Rebecca Ferguson is is wildly attractive, but uh, she's not at all scary in that movie, and not of it, that's not just because she has the stupid hat on, it's because she gets owned the entire film, every single time she encounters uh Danny Torrence and the little girl, she gets her ass kicked, it's always established from day one, from moment one that they're way more powerful psychially than her, and so at no point is there any sense that she's going to win, there's no danger at all, and then you have the fact that it's it's the lady from four non blondes not being threatening, you don't even have visual scares. Ooh, terrible. Rose the hat. Paul, Paul, have you heard of Rose the hat? King does have a hard time ending booksness because he doesn't plan them ahead of time. And you can't blame him for it. And I'd say I would argue that it's one of those deals where you have to accept the good with the bad and that like the the almost all artistic um, almost all artistic abilities and talents within a art form have deficits at the other side. so like a lot of directors or a lot of writers who can like really strictly plot out work uh they lack a certain like looseness and they lack and and their plots get schematic uh with Stephen King like I mean his process is sloppy his process is just explosive compulsive narrative there's no time to stop down and structure it but that means once you've gotten to like 600 pages it's like what do I do now and got to start, you have to start halfway through knitting it back together, and you got to take it, that's why a short fiction is his best stuff, early short fishing, especially, skeleton crew, uh, i almost forget the other one, I enjoyed i I still read new Stephen King though, uh, there's always value i find, I kind of like the institute, but I have noticed that there's a weird thing now where he ends a lot of his movies now with his books now with shoototouts, just people shooting each other, even movies with even books with supernatural shit, he ends up with people shooting each other, it kind of feels like he's like because he's getting older he's losing patience with the process of... nitting things back together and so it's just like - then everyone shoots each other and then boom like a third of the pair oh we get to pair a third of these characters we get to close a third of this plot holes perfect i like the institute although you know it's basically a greatest hits of his 80 stuff with all the kids being experimented on by the evil government although i've always love that i always love that stuff firestarter. Everything's eventually a short story, which is kind of he ripped off for the institute. Favorite on screen depiction of the devil? That's an interesting question. I think the witch is really good. just the moment when the voice hits, does that wish to live deliciously? would thou lice to taste butter, and then the the man coming up from behind, that's good, that's very good, uh, alpaccino, the devil's advocate, why not, just go for the rafters, you're the devil, why would you have any subtlety at that point? he's an absent landlord did i like blue ruin absolutely blue ruin's great i think uh blue riins like wonderful amazing uh not as not as debut second film but his first film is very low budget it's called murder party and it's actually pretty good especially when considered his first movie, and then blue roin is fantastic, amazingly assured, and then of course green zone is practically perfect, was not a much of a fan of the netflix one, there's it's it seems like most of the Netflix movies and part of it, maybe is that desacralization, i don't even know what's happening, like i feel like i don't watch them as closely, i feel like i don't watch these these netflix movies by like even guys i really respect, i don't i don't respect them, like a certain there's a certain patina off their name and the film that robs me of of uh of investment in the story and I noticed that that was true of like Gareth Edwards movie that he did for netflix the one about the cult i thought was really bad and it's like I love Gareth or no Garreth Evans and I was like I love Gareth Evans what's going on here and I think I don't think it's a great movie but I think part of the reason I didn't like it is because it just didn't feel right uh the first the first big name director to do a uh Netflix movie that won me over fully even though I didn't felt like sacriligious to not see it in the theater. was a ballot of buster scrubs, which I thought was brilliant, stem to stern en rapturing, even though I watched on a little relatively small tv compared to a fucking uh big screen, but I was like, oh god, top five fucking Colin Brothers movie in some ways, I would argue, I would argue that that's one of the most accomplished things I've ever done, because it's a greatest hits package, right? Every one of those, every one of... really is like their it's like one of their uh like the the um the clips episodes of a TV show only the clips are new and original uh and it's like hey you know you hey you guys like uh old brother w out now and they're like wacky antic uh old time uh cartoon style like that in hudsucker proxy how about some buster scrugs for you do you like their uh bleek nialistic uh existential horror here's some uh like no country for old men here's uh ticket oh you like uh the philosophical and uh and uh and uh self-referential naval gazing shit like a serious man at barton fink here's uh the last one with the with the the the stage coach i can't remember the name uh but and then in the mid cuuse and like i'm not i'm not mad cuuse i'm getting all the good stuff it's it's it's a good it's a good colon brothers buffet and then in the girl got gall got rattled they have a earnestly depicted romance. that is almost unique in their fucking uh film cannon, they pulled they like they developed a new pitch at like age 60, they're great, and that movie was so great that it kind of overcame uh Netflix thing. I'm still digesting uh the Irishman. I really really appreciate what it did, and I do think I understand what he's going for with it and I think he succeeded a lot. I don't love it as much as some people do, I have to say, uh, people who say what's like a better than casino or good fellows or even what? of wall street, I would disagree, but I think it's it's it's maybe his most ambitious work artistically uh, and and then that respect considering how much he lands, it's a dude's rock masterpiece and deserves to be, and I honestly wonder though, like will will will loves it, I think a little more than me, and guess what, he was one of those guys we got to see at the theater, I was unable to see in the theater, and I wonder if that participated, the fact that it to me really was a full Netflix movie might have robbed it a little bit, I don't know. I like the lighthouse, I didn't love it as much as a lot of people, but I was on a very potent edible when I saw it, uh, I should rewatch and I will. what do i think is the most grill pilled fictional character? that's very good uh, i mean obviously jeffrey labawski, the dude is often bandied about as a dude's rock icon, i agree completely uh dudd from lodge 49 of course protagonist the Kurt Russell's son, wiyat russell. doing a wonderful job, although he does often kind of feel more like Jeff Bridges his kid. Channing tatom's character in the magic mike films. uh, of course, of course Rick Dolton, of course Rick Dolton. Uh, I'd say, I would say Cliff Booth with an Astrix cuz I think Cliff Booth is a more complicated character and on purpose, like I think people who say that movie is bad because oh, he killed his wife, it's like, first of all, that is. is not established, and second of all, he didn't have to put that in there, he put that in there to thread the thing with complication and to complicate the audience's relationship to him as a wish fulfillment, as a as a masculine ideal, and honestly that's that is in its own way dialectically dude rock, so i'll throw him on there too, hell yeah peter from alpha space, are you kidding, also Peter venkman from ghostbusters, all the ghostbusters in fact. Yeah, today has been movie talk and I'm glad I haven't done it in a while and I really like movies and it's hard for me to talk about them because so few of them are good anymore, you know, I don't want to be a broken record, but I think I've established why I think that's true even if other people can disagree, so I'm hoping to see something good in the near future, someone send me, send me an angel, I haven't hit anything above like a soft four stars in a long time, if anyone has has any suggestions, even old movies i might not have seen, maybe we'll take this last couple of minutes to see if i can palm springs was fine, it was very cute, it was sweet, i think its approach to uh the the uh the subject, the old tired grown hawg day subject was good and clever, i think like all those stories, a good one is buddhist and that one was buddhist is shit, which i appreciated uh, i especially love the idea that it acknowledges the the like the dual reality of having of of accepting to yourself that nothing matters. that nothing is accumulated, that nothing is accumulated over time, but there is just the present, and the acknowledgement that everyone else is not necessarily has that same understanding, and that that creates compassion or it should, and that's where love comes from, and then eventual subsumption between the fantasy of separateness and the eternal, but still netflix, Hulu, I like JK Simmons in it, he was good, but once again like three and a half, three and a half stars. i'm topping out at a soft four is what i'm saying, i see something really good. all right, maybe i'll watch the host the jack belt even though it's only two and a half hours and not the full like three-hour ancholato. friends of edile is a great movie, ooh, i think i've recommended before how good and underrated uh Andrew demnicks killing them softly from 2010, i think is but uh but that's like literally the spiritual successor bause it's I think they're both based on George V Higgins books about Boston Skumbags in the 70s And it's got Robert Mitchum it's dirt bags oh it's good straight time I use I've always wanted to see that I had that on my list like grown-up movies to watch when I was a teenager but I never got around to it strange days is pretty good killing of a sacred deer I saw I didn't really like very much I think I'm not big on that lore ghost guy I think he's to me he's not to me I worry the... he's a medium talent, at least so far, ravinus is good, but i've seen it, take back the park, huh? interesting, bob robert is a great movie, blue collar is also a great movie, gamer is really good, neveldean and taylor man underrated, i saw a good time, i didn't really. like it the first time i saw it, but then i saw uh object gems and i got what they were going for cuz at first the reason i didn't like good time is cuuse the characters are so dumb they were difficult for me to want to be around long enough to even watch the movie but then i saw jams where it was that wasn't a problem and and i got like their whole aesthetic and like the the ratchet thing i was able to fix it really on like the ruob goldberg plot stuff over the annoying characters i have to say everyone likes Robert Pattenson now, but I'm not a fan of his like really subbrando like try hard physical uh uh method shit i just feel it. just feels forced, like I know a lot of people liked him in that movie uh, but what the hell is that out, the outback movie was with uh guy pierce, I know a lot of people liked him in that, I hated him in that, I did not like highlife or him in it, uh, honestly it felt like good time would have been better with the different lead actor too in my opinion, that's right, that's right, I don't, I don't credit him, I don't, I don't credit uh Pattenson, I'll say it right now, the rover, that's it. and even in like lighthouse, i was all about to fow, i didn't really care for pattenson in lighthouse either, i'm spilling the tea right here, that's right, macrisman, not a terribly fond of the robert patents and renaissance, i'm trying to think of who would be better for people to focus on than Robert Pattenson, but i kind of don't like any of those young british guys. Yeah, the fo is my other choice beside Michael Shanon to play John Brown in a real movie that took the religiosity of John Brown seriously that like centered the prophetic tradition and and was subjectively in the period like the witches, that would that would also be really good. All right guys, I'm gonna split. Oh, just one more thing, have you noticed that now every movie is about operators, like all the plots that were probably used to be about cops or now about fucking operators. I think I think Netflix is releasing like three straight big budget movies about fucking operators. They got uh, they've got operators versus street gangs in uh that movie extraction. They've got immortal Lady. operators in uh the old guard and then they've got now Megan Fox is a lady operator fighting a lion a CGI lion of course that's funny blood meridian is kind of about operators what is somebody did blood Meridian in Afghanistan maybe someone should do that not a direct not a direct. just adaptation with the same title, but basically just take the plot structure and some of the like the visual and metaphoric motives and use it to inspire a tale in Afghanistan. i think that might be good. much to consider. all right guys, talk to you soon.
