 and there's nowhere else to run, is a room for one more song, one more song, and you can't hold on, when you can't hold on, hold on. I want to sound up, I want to let go, you know, you know, no, you don't, you don't, I want to flash, but I hears a man, I want to reach out of the back of my broken hand, I want to never he, another heart break, so much older that I can take. preflection comes and goes, i need direction to perfection, no, no, no, no, help me out, yeah, you got to help me out, yeah, don't you put me on the back, you know you got to help me out, yeah, go, you know, you know, no, you don't, fuck, well, she took my love and ran it around with ever single guy in town hey hey yes it's the first bc uh stream the first or no i'm sorry acchat after chair or after demolition of chair i don't know but yes i know that no one can ever think of me the same way again after that one that's fine That's life, as Frank Cenatra said, but that's cool, in fact I find it uh useful, I can just uh, I can use it as a as a moment to cleanse my ego, um, this chair is well, this has all the bolts and if... the bolts falls out, I swear I'm going to actually put it back in and not just ignore it, which is what happened with the other one, it literally was my own fault, my own laziness, um, so Rumsfeld died today, and I got to say, I understand why people want to like celebrate when that happens, when one of these guys dies, when one of these ghouls actually dies and proves that they are not immortal reptiles, although honestly do we know for sure that any of these people die, do we know for? that they're not just molting from one fucking flesh skin to another, how do we know that they're not just peeling off their decrepid uh rumsfeld or HW Bush uh scales stepping out of it and being a a crisp new wet creature uh that can come on the scene and create a whole new arc of evil through the world like the demonic fucking uh arcans that they are, I mean these guys are arcans, these guys are they're so close to the center of evil and they're so uh consequential in the the misery of so many others that they are imbued with like real spiritual power, i think, they are sort of dark wizards, i mean and you know we know for a fact that they all to some degree or another, and you can argue about what degree, that they all love... of performing rituals of power from getting your ass paddled and having to jack off in a coffin for to join skull and bones or like how uh what's this nuts uh David Cameron, the uh the the absolute of British uh uh prime minister who put his dick in a pig's mouth, they love ritualized performances of humiliation as like a gateway to power, and then like indulgence uh as like a sacred ritual, like like... you are sacrificing millions on the altar of like your personal satisfaction and pleasure, you have to have if you're a thinking person with a fucking heart, and yes of course these people are sociopathic, but they also have they have identities that extend beyond that, they're not pure uh, you know, like nobody is purely self materially interested, right? like there's always something. surrounding that, and then they have to create channels to work through it, they have to vent all the associated bad feelings that come with being in that position, and they do that through ritualized indulgence or denial, and of course that's the difference between powerful conservatives and liberals is denial versus indulgence, but if when you're at the very top, you create rituals of indulgence. and that's what these people do from fucking bohemian grove to whatever the fuck they were doing onsteen's island they have this ritualized uh gradation of power that is conferred through uh performance of cruelty uh sallo got that 100% correct about like what is at the base of like he said he was is talking about fascism, but really any ruling power in a in the moment of crisis, like the whole context of sallow right, is that that is the uh puppet regime, that's the nazi puppet regime that was around um Mussolini uh in northern Italy after uh Mussolini was rescued from uh Italian like a state custody, the Italian state that had overturned him and was negotiating surrender with the allies. uh and and imprison Mussolini for his many crimes uh when he was busted out by of uh the like it really is some James Bond stuff Ato Scorziny who was like the Nazi James Bond uh flew Mussolini out of an island fortress on a fucking uh on a uh what do you call him a glider like you took a fucking glider it's wild and then they put him and a bunch of his like top fascist cronies up in charge of this puppet regime, the sallow social republic that was quickly enveloped and destroyed and and uh was finally over overrun by partisans, communist partisans who captured Mussolini and executed him and famously strung him up by his heels uh you know one of the people participated in the firing squad that killed Mussolini became a Italian communist politician after the war and... is actually in in parliament, so these uh, the fascists to run Italy, or run this little portion of Italy in the film, in Possolini's uh, film are consumed all in their consuming all of their time with these elaborate. uh rituals of sadism where they take these poor young people and subject them to the most horrifying violence that there is explicitly uh related to their erotic enjoyment of it, they're not just watching it coldly, it is it is sexual and it is a fusion of like sexuality like the the the it is taking bodily connection and stripping it entirely of intimacy and replacing it with domination. which is the end state of the ruling class in terminal crisis of death, it strikes out at everything, because it is isolated from everything, and so eroticism and is all of life, all of life is aesthetics as it is under fascism, and those aesthetics are of theatrical violence and cruelty, and of course that's present in capitalism at every stage, but when you get to the end point and the south social republic, it was 20 days just like Sodom before it was overrun, so these people were partying in a burning building, and they all knew it, nobody thought that they were uh in charge, nobody thought that they were they had the fucking Allen. on the run, they knew that these were the last days and they engaged as you would, that means that when you get to the end of capitalism, all that's left is dominion and a culture around dominion, an intimate dominion that is required by the intimacy of crisis conditions necessitates, necessitates an eroticized uh sadism, now of course the reason we aren't having that kind of... explosion here is because we're so far from it, because capitalism even though it is in a crisis where conditions of apocalypse are already here, but unevenly distributed, the rest of the people within these systems and the ones closest to the the organs of political organization, legal authority, and electoral structures and access uh and and uh proximity to technology uh and to capital flows, like the most the most central subjects are not experiencing that, what they're experiencing is is the fear of it, because they're seeing it around them and they're feeling bad about it, but they don't feel the way that a guy in the room has to feel as they're uh carrying out some sadistic ritual, they don't have to feel... about it, the way that the uh, the way that the sallow aristocrats felt about it, as in having to be there and having to really turn your brain into something that finds that pleasurable, fight against all human connection and all of your instinctive sense of of continuity with the universe, cut it away, carterize it, but most people aren't going to do that, and most people don't have to, because they could afford. to imagine that they're not benefiting from that more than they are being underminded for it because they are aware of their own subject position, because we're not in charge of anything, we're not in charge of anything, and so instead of confronting the... horrors of the system that they're happening right in front of us, we can perform rituals of either cruelty simulated in the form of voting and like what t-shirt you wear and what you post online, and remember this is a cruelty that is across the board of all liberal people who think that they're on top and think that when it comes to the the end of the line when they're when they're in the solo social republic they are assuming that they would be the ones uh 'who are the guests and not the the servants, like if they close their eyes and put themselves in Passeline's solo at the end of capitalism, when it is the naked lunch at the end of your fork instead of this machinery of ritual and technology and distance and geography and culture and spectacle that get you to uh detach from it and and and operate within it complicitly well also powerlessly and they say where are you going to be? if if we got those conditions now, where would you end up? we have elites, and by that i mean even people uh who are aspiring to positions within the uh knowledge economy, people who think i'm going to be a professor or i'm going to be a media professional, i'm going to be a uh a influencer, but for the left, i'm going to, i'm going to do these things. fuck i forgot what i was saying, i'm going to ritualize my anxiety about this situation, about this horrifying precariity, because uh "I don't want to be the one watching that, I don't want to be the sallow person. I identify with the other. I have niche slave morality, and so I can't even though I'm a ruler, or I imagine myself that in the future I'll be a ruler, so you have to create a situation where the people who are suffering, have it coming, and it's not your fault, and you're not indulging in it, you're you're not doing it sensually and dominatingly the way that say the fascist, the right-wing wood, you're going to do it by punishing the guilty, you're going to be doing by guiot." and by being john brown you're going to be able to uh carry out that violence not in a spectacle and like the fascist wood but in a of law in a in a uh performance of of domination over uh over over righteous enemies, but obviously most of us would not, most of us who are having these conversations, and this is where a lot of the confusion comes in about things like the PMC, all the people within this discussion, if they closed their eyes and said, where would you imagine yourself? if you were going through like a portal to that period, where would you imagine yourself, and of course a lot of them would say, actually I'd be the partisans, I'd be the communist partisans, no, you would be at the Salo Republic, but will you be, because the Salo Republic is the closing neck, uh, the gilded collar coming around the necks of those in the center of the global capitalist system as it pulls away from the periphery as the climate. uh catastrophes uh accelerate, so you're never going to be outside of it, you're always going to be in it, and so you're either going to be on top or you're going to see yourself fall down to a position of total exploitation. most of the people who are talking about politics, if you actually pulled their soul, they would say that they would imagine that they would be on top, but because of the trajectory of downward mobility in America, because the final dissolution of the Fortest compromise. because of the fact that the uh that the home-owning uh like semi autonomous suburban yowen of America uh that that their entire that their share of the capital pie uh has been gone has been cut away for 30 years now 40 years now and you're just living off of the fat of this dead thing, the American labor movement, uh, they're just on the on on this corps, eating the fat of it, it is a cargo cult, and so everybody who went to college thinking that they were going to get a job and be able to live a life like their parents, their own place, uh, their kids, uh, some sort of sense of control over their their their leisure time, their work. flow uh and confidence that their children would have a fucking future, those things are all gone, but people still have those expectations because that's how they were brought up, and that's the conflict, that's why you have people saying that the PMC is the new elite, no, but do they fancy themselves that in the global conflict for con uh over resources that we're currently in? the final grasp of of for for for air as as the water levels literally rise uh the continuation of the war that's been going on ever since uh the end of world war ii really to to uh create a economy as a giant hose sucking uh surplus to the west from uh the south from from to from the to the north from the south a giant hose. and that's continuing in a context now of genuine uh accelerating entropy uh and a feedback loop whereby the externalities of... which are not priced into capitalist transactions, but exists nonetheless in real life, are accumulating, and the system as it is cannot address them because it doesn't see them, it's dark matter in in the world, according to the the rationalist approach that dominates our economic understanding of the world, that is what makes us do transactions the way we do. is premised on the notion that there is an out exterior, an outside of the transaction world where all of the friction accumulated in that transaction, all of the social alienation that accumulates from subjects who are forced into these conditions, all of the destabilization of the ecology that occurs from from changing things like carbon dioxide outputs and uh put the undergurting uh logic of the algorithm of of profit extraction, that thing that is not priced just happens somewhere else, but there is nowhere else to account for it. the thing that's supposed to account for it, i would say in the if there is a teleology of marxism, it is that this dark matter ends up creating its own articulation, its own social uh reality that can then come into conflict with this broken system that cannot recognize what's in front of it, that is. the hope of class consciousness, but the machinery of class consciousness broke in the 70s, so we're now in a point where there is just this accelerating crisis that will only be resolved by it starting to break up and change the conditions and relationships that undergird these dynamics, because they can be arrested and diverted at every point is the key. i've been listening to a very good podcast. called uh fall of civilizations recently uh, it's in the it's sort of in, I would say it's sort of in between uh Dan Carlin and like uh, Mike Duncan or something, it's it's pop history, but it's well researched and it's about different civilizations in decline and and it uh describing what those conditions uh what conditions brought it about, and it's amazing, when you exclude the ones uh where it's an outside invasion that emerges and changes like a rapid condition exogenously like like the uh the Spanish invasions that you could argue that there were internal contradictions within the azach state, obviously there were, but the definitive uh disruption of that relationship came from outside, but then uh, but excluding those where you have civilizations that collapse from within like the fucking uh, like the... for example who started decline long before uh the Europeans got to uh latin america uh and or the the late bronze age uh or um greenland or the uh the kamiers the thing that they all have in common is that humans came together to adapt to their environment to create a system that allowed them to manage the the the dangers, the scarcity, that's the word, the scarcity of their social conditions, dictated by their geography, that is what starts the building of civilization, some people sitting around thinking of things to do, directing resources, doing ritual shit, other people putting their nose to the physical grindstone of uh of creating a fixed agricultural civilization. some working for for others, for others and then those people may be giving each other like some sort of uh payment to simulate an exchange that is like uh based on exploitation when really the exploitation is happening at the bottom uh and but the culture, this is the important part as in the refied structures that people navigate mentally is created by the top, the structure of this social order is created at the top, it might be be made out of like uh a social relationship uh a distribution of a people um and then like the actual infrastructure of okay we have surplus what do we do with it what do we build with it well let's build uh some fucking canals so that we can generate uh uh more uh stable supply of uh of food so that we can have a larger population so that we can compete with other populations of people and so that we can um we can we can maintain stability and the structures that are created by the people who are sitting around all day are dictated are are determined by that this relationship where some work for behalf of others at the rate that they want that they're dictating the terms and that will persist until a climate related. shift that is often but not always precipitated by the specifics that these civilizations have taken to change the relationship to the land and their relationship to like uh human habitation like hey we're going to sell here we're going to we're going to grow this here we're going to clear this land for more crops we're going to move this water here. like that uh, that is all those decisions are made by those who are benefiting by the labor of.... but they want to keep it that way, so that means that when the feedback loop changes, and those external changes to the the externalities put out into the into the ecology, the shifts that have been put on the, the the the randomness generator of like the natural world, all start pushing in the same direction and then that pushes back, and when that happens when you have a system. of dr when you have a bunch of droughts that overflow your water systems or that uh you have a diminishment of global temperatures that reduce uh your crop fecundity and and and you have uh you run out of arable land and the arable land you have uh begins to be exhausted of uh minerals by overplanting to sustain population growth that allows for the maintenance of your social structure and so when those externalities start but piling up, the system cannot recognize the cause of them because it is made up of dark matter, it's not built into the equation, they don't understand it, and so even though there are things they could do hypothetically to to address these crises and maintain homogeny, maintain a social order, maintain a social body, they fail because to change in a way that would be that would maintain the social order, like greatly like the social body that you're part of, would require those at the top to actually do some fucking work, it would have to change the distribution of labor within the system, oh we can't hyper exploit others so that we can have and and have more efficient agriculture so that we can have more surplus that can be eaten in the cities and eaten in the temples, well we all dance around and do bloods sacrifices and uh and look at our fucking calendar to figure out why this is happening when the answer is right in front of our face and if we had applied the genuine um like presence of mind that that uh exemplifies the best imagined tradition of empirical uh science and engagement if we had the eyes that we had had when we designed this system to confront the crisis now we could fucking... lick it, but it would undermine the social order, because changing those structures knocks down the whole fucking thing, and so over and over again the fall of civilization is a civilization finding itself confronted with a change in the expectation of the uh the climate, an expectation of how much water would come when, how much? fertility would exist in x amount of land, how much, how much calories you could get, you could you could guarantee from a certain area, because once you have a stable and sort of guaranteed house of calories, you can start distributing them, and you can start distributing them to build institutions of technology, of social technology, of of literal technology, scientific mind, scientific acuity and bring it to the question of civilization. like the the the thing that actually uh the mechanism that uh really does undergird alienated civilization, pre-socialist civilization is uh this is the consumption, is the earth? labor is not is not the value associated is not where value comes from because the fundamental idea that of the labor theory of value in my mind metaphysically is that because labor is unpleasant, the labor that is alienated and all labor under under uh regimes of control is alienated because you're not getting the benefit of it and you're not choosing to do it, you're not choosing to do it, someone else is making you do it, so it is alienated labor, that is pain that accumulates in the system is feedback that has to be addressed, that has to be suwed, that has to be transformed into something. and as long as culture is being made by people produce even because there is a relatively small number at the top able to whose culture is very uh contain, like pre-modern civilizations, they were what those guys were talking about and what they were making is much farther from the experience of the average person within that polity than is true in the modern world of mass uh literacy and mass media, like those guys were living in a different world in inside the castles and inside the temples, for one thing they could fucking read, they could read and write, which the vast majority of these people could not do. that meant that they could spend their time endlessly building a culture, and of course what the the temples are what's left, so we look back and we say, oh, that's the civilization, no, that was this thing on top of the social order, the real the real culture was going on at the base, but that real culture is gone, we can't see it, it's dissolved, all we have left is this, and now we all live in it, we live in the temple, because the temple is now the internet, the temple is the internet, and we all live in it, everybody who got to this x point where they are alienated, but but comfortable enough to put time into creating a identity that extends beyond themselves into a cyber real. where their actual subjectivity, their human sense of self is no longer extricable from this network, which is where we all are, once we took over, because technology allowed the smaller number, a much larger group to emerge out of the exploitation of one group by another, imperialism. "the spoils of imperialism were were measured out at at the top, not evenly, but over time, which created more leisure and more technology, more importantly, more time to spend in the cloud, which makes your reality part of the cloud in a way that previous people were fundamentally not, like this is a difference, this is where you go from a society that is that is by'. where we're only seeing half of it or or not even half by by uh only half by like relationship not half by numbers a minority that's what we get that's all we have ever had and that is what you have to have in a society that is pre-uh that is dominant based but pre-modern that is class based but pre-modern once you have a modern social uh media once you have mass media you have uh taken huge chunks of people who are being exploited and who get to live in the realm of the rulers, they get to live in the the cloud with the rich people, they get to live in the temple, they get to live in the temple of their minds while their bodies are doing actual labor, and that is, that's what's scary about the moment is that if we are now a point where this dark matter that is now pushing against our social order that is accumulated since we went to a global system, once we created a world system uh we created a closed economic system and all of our models are based on open ones, every model we have of how humans interact and engage with each other are premised with interactions having external alities not priced in, which means we're literally unable to see their contribution to this until it's too late, because you could argue it's too late, i think that to avoid a a breakup from within to avoid that crack, that fall of a civilization, but what that means is up to us, because civilizations can fall in different ways, there's no, there's nothing i would say that necessitates the fall of this civilization. miss, you don't have to, if you really think that that that the light of humanity is going to be extinguished in the next 100 years, you can really, you can do the saturn, the the backanalia, now how at some point it's going to get too sadistic and you're going to have to ask yourself what you actually care about, but you can live in that gray zone for a while, so That isn't to say that we aren't going to all die in 100 years or 200 years, it is simply to say that any, you cannot approach that question and answer it objectively, because these are things that frankly none of us are equipped to know, predicting the future is the hardest thing in the world, understanding the past is is impossible, predicting the future is equally impossible, it is absurd to do so, and it's it's one of the lowliest intel. amount of carbon that we're producing, amount of energy necessary, amount of energy consumption, all these questions, you can look at them all and get a pretty good map of of where we're going with nothing changes, and of course that's the big if if nothing changes or if not enough changes fast enough, but you're filling in the gaps in your own. you are not getting some perfect understanding and rendering of this, you are looking through a glass darkly and you're filling in the spaces with what you want to be true, even if you don't know you're doing it, this is the most important part, does not have to be conscious, in fact it isn't if it was conscious, you'd have to deal with it, you get to keep it under, and then it stains your reasoning like it does everyone's in a way that you cannot perceive, so everyone. is like convinced that that's the case, you have to, i think you should admit that the deciding factor in you believing that is not any extrapolation from data or rational response or considered thing, it is the the seductive freedom, the seductive indulgence that it suggests, buse you really could say like what i'm not really hurting anybody, yeah i'm hurting a little people. bit, you know, I'm I'm I'm consuming carbon outside of my uh, vastly outside of what I what I should as an individual, uh, I, I, I, subsist on the labor of other people and other countries and and uh, the manufacture uh and agricultural sectors to provide me with food, I even here domestically, I take advantage of people through delivery services and and servant apps, but all that violence is is sublimated and and I really am many ways not responsible for it, so why not just have fun, and it's like, yeah, you know what if you can convince yourself of that, do it, but at a certain point you're going to hit it where it doesn't work anymore, the hidonic treadmill uh eventually leaves you exhausted, you will be left exhausted, you will be left to husk. because the pleasures over time become familiar and therefore less pleasurable and also just the the the uh the sensuous uh energies the chemical and hormonal uh and your physical components of of of uh sensation forget even sensual sensuality in general not even sexuality sensuality in general sensual pleasures and those even include like the pleasures of uh the pleasures of like uh sapaparific indulgence are also those, like being lazy is that too, those all go, that the ability to to uh to feel sensuously is also adult physically and just through repetition, and you're still going to be in this condition where you're headed towards the the furnace, but also feeling guilty and power. guilty and uh miserable and then that they can't be masked anymore and once you get to that point you have to say what do I do and the problem with trying to coordinate action among people who are all experiencing this is that everybody is in a different point in that trajectory the dream the fantasy the mystical hope of like a a universal awakening comes from the idea of everybody getting to the same point at the... same time, the same point of this isn't working anymore at the same time. and so we're all floating through space trying to grab each other and form a human shane away from being casted into the sun basically we are reaching out and grabbing at each other and we're and we're being scattered through space by the momentum that we've had by our accumulated interactions, we're just bouncing off of one another through space, the only way we're going to fucking uh avoid getting eaten by the sun as if we all get our hands together and move in the same direction. and that by doing that we can change our our physical presentation, our material arrangement towards the relationship to it and and push us into a stable orbit, and that comes from people reaching a similar point of disillusionment with the life as they've known it and similar need to change directions to avoid catastrophe, avoid, avoid a crack-up that can no longer be smothered. now that's not going to happen naturally, that there would be too un improbable, that's just what it boils down to, these are all random, we're all random particles bouncing off each other, the odds that any of us are going to get into a point where we can. have a meaningful moment of of clarity is is randomized too, so it would be the ultimate lottery win, it would not never, it's just it would not happen, but people are still always bouncing off of each other, and they're always bouncing off of concepts and ideas and exper, and they're all having experiences and when they line up the light right way like on a codex or fucking uh combination lock, it pops something and then if that happens, you can change the direction that you're going, you know those little, those little, if somebody saw gravity with Kluny where he's going around on the chair and he's able to change his direction with the little uh oxygen spurts, that those little moments are those are spurts that allow us to reorient ourselves, but of course they're not constant, i mean you'd have to be sended plane for them to be constant. most of us are regular people, we have flashes, then we go back to being normal, and then we have to live in that normal space until we have another flash, but we can array ourselves in those moments between with the little spirts, and then increase the likelihood that we're going to bang into somebody else and maybe change their trajectory by making them have one of those moments and then you can start moving in a direction with others. and using just your bodily, the accordion like muscle tension to move you through space. so if you accept that your blackpilled convictions come from not your best rational mind, but your most, your worst, most indulgent mind, if you accept that. and then operate from the premise that therefore you are still an agent of history, you still have a responsibility to yourself and everybody else to move through space and time in harmony with it, because otherwise it will make you miserable, forget everybody else, this is the difference between puritinism and real spirituality, says no, the fact that you're not getting you're not enjoying it makes it better, which of course it's the whole perverted uh uh superego uh dictatorship of the modern liberal who is a descendant of the periodted mind, you do it because it feels good, you do it because it is good for you, it provides you to feel harmonious, which is the ultimate, the ultimate distillation of when we say what does it mean to feel good in any abstract sense, what does it mean to feel right? to feel home, to feel safe, secure, to feel validated, it is in harmony with the moment, and most of us never feel that because we're being ground through this thing without any awareness of where we're going or anything, and and the ability to uh, to not allow the feelings, the emot the the the physical feelings associated with our life to dominate and dictate are uh the mental world we live in. Well I was supposed to do book club requests today and I didn't really look at the chat so let's do it now if anyone has any ideas. speaking of books uh, it was announced today that i i signed a contract with zero books to do uh a book called behold a fail horse, which is going to be some transcripts and edited and and and polished of course uh of interviews with me, maybe an essay based on these last few that i feel like have been pretty uh, uh pretty helpful, I feel like I'm getting somewhere. It's never going to be finished, but at some point I'm gonna say good enough, that's for sure. Somebody said the black Jacobns by CLR James, and that is not a bad suggestion, I will take that into account, I'm not going to... necessarily say now, but that's the leader in the clubhouse. i just got done listening to uh, my friend Evereth's really good Napoleon podcast series on the Haisian War of independence and it is making me been thinking about Haiti a lot, so uh. Yeah, it's called age of Napoleon, let me let me uh plug that, one of the best history podcasts out there, uses Napoleon basically as a lens to look through the uh the the uh the the the phenomenon of like Europe's uh final uh mess. the birth into full modernity, like napoleon is basically the mid-wife of modern Europe, he pulls that baby out of the mother, gets the forceps in there, yanks through out, history on horseback just yanking that baby out of the out of the gap, so he's a very useful character to examine the whole process through, because that really is that that period from uh from the revolutionary war to uh probably There you've got uh, I would say, there's two, there's three crucial flashpoint conflicts that defined the that define the the uh, the trajectory of capitalism as it breaks free of containment, basically in Europe, because capitalism starts off as just the accumulation of a bunch of practices, ideas and technologies which had existed throughout human history, the Chinese famously had most of them, but even in Europe they'd existed in some form or another throughout its period and its existence and even back in the the Grechoman era. what happened specifically in uh in modern Europe though is that you had a the creation of a technologically uh advancing social order coming? into uh um uh coming to a point of crisis created by first the the uh the the black death and it's a combat its change of uh property relations, it's undermining of ruling class authority, like there is a long-term crisis of authority at the top of feudalism that emerges from the black death because there's so much more land because of all the fucking people who died, that the individual agricultural workers had a much better hand that they could play, they could withhold their labor at their own terms because they could always just live off the land, and the response to that is enclosure, the creation of uh a uh landless peasantry who would have to sell their labor to live, that's and that's where capitalism comes from, as a response to the crisis created by the uh, the crisis. created by um the black death and colonialism was part of the process of solving that, and at first it did, it southed the engine a little bit, it it it brought in currency into the system, which was very important, but I would say that uh, once you have that explosion and you have this the emergence of these forces, the unleashing of the bourgeois, basically that occurs at the beginning of uh of the of the 1400s, 1500s. It culminates in a in a the first big crisis, the first third continent wide crisis that rends it apart and that makes it have to break, it has to break up the foundations of the system that it accumulated to that point is the period from the 30 years war uh uh basically I would say from the beginning of the 80 years war in the Netherlands through the 30 years war including this the English civil war and ending with uh the glorious revolution of 1688. you have a political revolt of broadly the bourgeois over the landed aristocratic nightly class of Europe that had been the rulers of feudalism. that fight starts in the immediate aftermath of the of the black death, it accumulate, it it it culminates in this crisis and then the creation of the west phalian system of competing states that are internally coherent and uh have like and whose sovereignty is respected across borders sort of as assumption like if you are the the head of state by that definition you are the legitimate ruler of that area like the the your rulership and this is still how we understand sovereignty now in international law basically until the the the people who are in charge say different but uh at the time there were none like so within the system is whoever in charge is the legitimate government, so that means that this this breaks up the the dreams of universal monarchy or a religious basis for authority and rulership, which had broken up over the uh the reformation? nope, we're doing real politique, we're doing nations, we can't do religion, if we do religion, everyone's going to die, we learned that in the 30 years war, if we do religion, everyone is going to die. so we'll do it on nations, and nations started to compete with one another, and out of this competition, the system that best accommodated uh that competition was the one that most assiduously took the mechanisms of capitalism and use that to make their economic structure more efficient at extracting surplus, and that was the the constitutional monarchy of... of the uh of the hanivarians, it took a long fight, they had to kill a king, they had to have a fucking commonwealth, they had to have a bunch of civil wars, they had to fucking uh fight off a bunch of angry scottish guys, but they ended up with this dutch motherfucker who came over after a job interview and agreed to basically let the burgers run the show, because it it worked, it got them uh, it got them money, it got them control of resources. in the rest of the world, it got them uh rulership over the sea, over the seas, it got them an empire where the sun would never set, and then so Europe starts competing on that browns, the other states have to play catchup, now the main other state is France, France is doing catch up with Britain, that's why it's fighting with Britain in these wars and exchanging slugs, but losing all the way because it does not have this efficient structure, it's burgers have not been empowered, and so once the crisis is within it become to accumulated, it pops off in 1789 with a bourjois revolt there, and then that boujois revolt culminates in the figure of Napoleon as the English civil war culminated in the figure of Cromwell, who then marches across the fucking continent literally uprooting all of the uh, all of the... efficient systems, holy roman empire, you're done, dogdom of Venice, out of here, fucking the grand knights of Malta, you are, you have been creatively destroyed in the chumperterian sense, that was what the french civil, the french revolution, and then the napoleonic wars war, it was buse Europe was never, England after the hundred years war was always looking in other directions, it wasn't looking at Europe, it never really was, it was like: Okay, we we're not going to be a European power in that sense, but we're going to wield power elsewhere. France was still a European power, and so it brought the competition of the bourgeois state that had been... pretty much dominated by the Dutch and the English before that point who had been fighting each other until they had a fucking uh a leveraged buyout which is what happened the dutch basically uh oh the hannivarians came uh came later but William of Orange was a Dutchman literally the the the exhausted Dutch Republic being being bought out basically by uh by the British. so the French bring this bourgeois revolt to the European continent, and then through superior adaptation to the marketplace, they just carve up all these less efficient feudal remnants, and they replace them with with a modern, with modern people, modern conceptions of nationalism that is now not just a state project, but a middle class political project, my god, now you've got a whole new basis to undergird this thing. nationalism ethno nationalism, hell yeah, now you don't need, now this thing that's bigger and more unwieldly and has much more uh complicated social structure and and mechanisms of uh of of culture that have to be maintained and more and more people who have to be put to idle work, mind work, more and more minds are going to be idle and they have to have something to do, give them nationalism, build a state, now you've got a project. Well, capitalism is still grinding around behind these people, disrupting them, undermining their uh structure and exhausting their their uh ability to uh max to do profit in the closed system of their of their uh of their individual economies, and that conflict in in a in a political context of nationalism. There you got your third big explosion, 1914 to 1945, and so we're now in the aftermath of that, when when the national model was essentially broken and replaced. by international capitalism and institutions, cultural, uh, political and most importantly economic, replace national ones, international, international capital is truly born in that era, and now we are living in this totalized capitalism, but there's nothing left to convert, uh, to uh, transition that belief to, this is the crisis, this is why it's the final crisis. when uh, when the divine right of kings was extinguished over the course of the 17th century, it was not, that faith didn't just evaporate, it had to go somewhere, and it went to individual like uh religion, it went to confession, there of the reformation after all, the king shming, we need to be able to define ourselves by our religious tradition, well okay, that holds for a little bit, but then the 17th century shows up, uh-oh, that's not good, turns out, religion can't do it either, and over the course of the 7 to8 century, you have the emergence of this new liberal nationalism, this idea that we are all individuals, pursuing individual self-interest, but within a framework of identity, within a box within humanity, and then we fought that out until it became uh, no longer tenable after ' in the crisis of the early 20th century, because periodic crisis are are emblematic and definitive of capitalism, it continue, there will always be cyclical crisis of of increasing uh uh devastation because of increased uh extinguishment of the system and increased uh just literally population and cultural density. Now all that we have is ourselves, that's all we've had since the end of 45 is ourselves as individuals. and there's there's no way to fight back within that framework is the thing, that's that's where that's where we're kind of screwed, we have to build it ourselves, these other things are built in by the superstructure of capitalism, these things were inscribed in the culture that we all imbibed, the religious confessionalism, the liberal nationalism, they were all embedded within the thing. now though, there's nothing embedded because the social has disappeared, they were directly ruled in a way that we've never been before, in in a society that doesn't have the total technological control that ours does, and when i say technological, i mean just to the power of the money form, the fact that you can't not in most of the world live outside of the cash nexus, that is a genuine enslavement, that's why it's so funny when people say, i'm not going to live in the cuba and i'm not going to eat bugs, bitch you already live in the cube, you already eat bugs, because all other systems of life are closed off, you cannot live outside of them. I mean my god how are you what's the difference between like some nice clean roasted crickets and whatever fucking uh pig anus and uh Kruitsfelt Jackup brain slurry uh uh fucking uh fees rat poison uh uh barbichuit fucking uh antibiotic slurry that you eat if you go to a fucking taco bell one time, I and I'm not saying it's i eat the bugs cuuse I eat that shit, I'm not going to act like there's a line I won't let cross because the line doesn't exist, you will always accommodate it because you're comfortable, and that is the point of the follow civilization thing is that the civilization can never correct because it cannot. mind its own control, people within it are too wetted to it, because they cannot imagine living outside of it, they cannot imagine living with their hands, they cannot imagine living no longer within the systems of esteam and comfort and consumption that they have generated, oh shit, to get back to something that I've forgot a while ago, I got to stitch these together cuuse I think this makes sense, the the martial. revolution is just the situation where culture, where the steering wheel of humanity is hijacked fully by a self-conscious bourgeois, which then imposes itself on a public, on a national and international subject. because we are consumers, it is the consumer's choice that defines the market, and the thing is, that is a exact correct understanding of how the movement works in capitalism, because it moves towards need, it it moves towards power and need, the needs of those in power, or next to power who benefit from powers overwhelming and overflowing larges, which is what we have, a giant suction system of need, and so we build a culture. of the consumption and then we look at it and say culture is consumption and therefore we are consumption and that's only possible because of our alienated we are from ourselves as workers and how few of us do meaningful work within the fucking temple, which is why we are facing this new crisis that is as overwhelmingly obvious as when the sun started dimming on the mians or the fucking uh the little ice age kept the uh froze all the uh the waters between greenland and iceland or the fucking - or or 30-year or the like the fifth year of the drought hit uh anker what that's not a drawing of me that's Paul Jiamati thank you very much that's a famous papaparazi shot of him on the subway looking glum and giamatiesk so the but the mar revolution is part of that general process of economists describing the world as capitalism makes it and then reifying it as natural law, even though it is the contingent best interest of the capitalist class a given moment, which is in conflict with the best interest of the species and the planet, because of all these unpriced externalities that the ruling class is unaware of and can't see, their material interests cannot recognize it, because their material interest in the near term depend on it. so we find ourselves in a situation where people from the guys who say i won't eat the bugs to the people who say we're gonna we're gonna guillotine all the rich people uh to the people say, i need, i'm keeping my guns so that when they come for it, i can i can go down like a man and i can fight for my rights, that moment is pen passed for everyone in this bubble, like the guy with the gun, what he thinks that gun represents is the frontier mastery of theself that the early yomen American farmers had or imagine they had or at least had a much they imagined it too, but they actually had the ability to live off the land, they could live off the land, they could live outside of the market, they were free from the market. that gun is just the way to keep that state of affairs. we have people now who think that they're in that same position, and you think that that gun represents the is the guarantor of that position, who have been fully stripped from their ability to sustain themselves, who have been fully atomized and made them and and are... fully at the mercy of the market, they cannot live outside the market, the market uh sustains them, it's like getting booted out of the matrix without there be the zion to catch you, booted out of the matrix to die of exposure in a public park, that's what we have, and that is the that's what the extravagant public cruelty display of homelessness in this country is meant to convey. so that gun is a fucking trinket, that gun is a is a is a is a symbol not of rights that you're defending, but of rights you've lost, that's what that gun represents, because your right is to go on a shooting spray, your right is to get shot by to do suicide by cop, okay, but you're not going to do that, and by the time you do it, it'll be a... lost fucking cause and even your dream of being part of some wolverine z resistance will mean nothing, it will be a pathetic orgy of of pointless bloodshed, and you'll know it, that's the important part, you'll know it, you'll know that it's a farse, you won't go down smiling, you won't go to fucking uh, valhala to sup in the fucking uh, in the uh mead halls of the gods, you're going to be shitting yourself and crying. if you get up the balls to do it, which you won't, you will either acced to what they want you to do, or if you say no, or if you just can't hack with their new demands are, mentally, you get kicked out, you get up to go on the other side of the human line, you are no longer a person, you are homosaucer, at that... it doesn't fucking matter what you do with that gun, go nuts, you have no ability to threaten anyone that matters, sassi sau. All right, well I didn't talk too much about the book club, although I got to say uh Black Jacobs is leading in the club house because you guys know I'm all about alternative history, I'm trying to do some projects along those lines, and uh, I've been thinking a lot about Haiti as a result, Haiti, reconstruction, uh, the 1918, like the real, the real protein moments, the real the real lubricated joints. in the structure, um, but yeah, I want we won't say for next week, but uh, I'll think about it and announce if I want to do it, I'll see. i'll see you guys get my hands on a copy, unless i think of something else though, it's the leader in the club house.
