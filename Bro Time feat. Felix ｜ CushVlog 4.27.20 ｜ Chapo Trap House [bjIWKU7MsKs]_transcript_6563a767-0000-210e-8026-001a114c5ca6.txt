 Hi everybody, the hooting and the halloring just started, the 7 o'clock hooting haller, everybody putting them everyone else, everybody being thankful that the lights still work, everybody being thankful. that they can still order ground and that the g and the uh garbage is still getting taken out and that the internet hasn't stopped working. hi everybody, thank you guys, it's not as nice today as it was the other day, sadly it's been raining the last couple of days, but it's good enough to be outside. question already, wow uh, can I suggest a film for Chapo to watch, you mean like as a thing to talk about? Well, there's a couple that we have in store uh, and a couple ideas I've had, I think we should probably do one about uh southland tales at some point, we've talked about it a lot, and uh, might as well, and uh, I want to do an episode with Will about Richard. jewel soon cuuse i feel like that movie uh that movie was really good. apparently some stuff i said last night was part of orthodox suity thought, of course it is. i mean it's a cliche to say this and it's like it's it sounds like a a co-exist bumper sticker but like all all religious. start from a fundamental understanding of the same reality, they are just translated differently based on the cultural context in which they emerge, they're all groping towards the same thing, they're all grabbing the same elephant, and so it makes sense all the stuff refracts through every other secular and religious belief system, like i said like marx, marx was vibing on these same frequencies the same way that buddhists are and uh sufis and fucking whatever, what every even some prots do that, not that many of course, certainly very few in the United States, uh, because they think heaven is real, like it's a city, i got to say, i don't really know if you can like communicate realistically to somebody who is convinced in the way that i am convinced of what i think is real, that heaven is like a place, like there's a street, there's something with the 72 versions like really. that's your idea of eternity. you know what eternity is? it's like, yeah, it's basically like - south padre island. come on, shape up religions, let's get out of here, i addressed this, but why the CIA preferred abstract expression is because it did not have a political violence, because you look at a piece of abstract art and you're going to have an individual response to it, it's not going to refer to material circumstance that other peop can all that other people who see it can all agree to, it's totally individualized, the response to it is entirely individualized, and that's great, and you guys can argue about what it means and none of you will be right, and none of you will draw political implications from it, because you're making a totally subjective emotional reaction, social realists are that that is inextricably linked to uh the conditions that produce it and points towards those conditions, that's a common vocabulary. get a common set of problems that emerge from the the work, that people who all who see it, all who expose themselves to it, they can all have um, they're all going to have the same vocabulary in discussing it, it's not going to be an individualized uh point of view, and that is dangerous hypothetically, uh, I mean presumably a lot of those feelings will just get uh re um capitalated and and reabsorbed as they always are, but if there's too much excess, if there's too much that can't be uh absorbed, then you really have a problem. was not an abstract expressionist of course, cubism is not uh abstract expressionism, how will they under report death counts when bodies keep biling up? well, for one thing, they're already uh keeping but death counts down by not testing people who have died of it uh are suspected to have died of it, but before they were tested and by calling things like heart attacks and strokes and uh uh Yeah, they were opportunities, I'm sorry, I got, I don't want to get distracted, I'm trying to say something, uh, but there uh, and the people dying of like the number of people dying of COPDD and uh, and pneumonia are already shooting up and those aren't being counted as COVID deaths, so they're already undercounting to begin with, and it's not even at that point going to necessarily be a question of undercounting as a question of normalizing to the degree, and now you might say, well, you know, you could overwhelm the healthcare system, not if we re, not if we re, if we reorient like the expectation of care if you have it, it it'll be like, oh, you have it, there just isn't any place for you, or it's full, or it'll be treiaged by like wait time or or ability to pay, and if you can't get the car in time, that will be a... sad for you and for your family, but it will also be how things are now, the same way that thousands of people getting shot by guns, thousands and thousands and thousands of people being killed by cars, tens of thousands of people dying, hundreds of thousands of people dying for lack of healthcare, uh, people dying from surgical mistakes, people buying from every element of capitalist corner cutting and and uh and copper theft, copper wire theevery that has made. up uh uh the the the morbidity now, look at fucking opits, look at how many people are dying of opiat addiction, tens that what is 80,000 people a year or something like that, that's that's a stunningly high number compared to what it used to be even a few years ago, and it's just a sad bummer, it's a thing that happens, yeah you're normalizing the structural violence and you do that at every level, like if you accept that like this stuff is a mixture of natural circumstance and uh and structural inevitabilities and yes it's violence and obesity too, obesity too, like yeah we're going to give everybody uh uh we're going to replace real food with corn paste, we're going to put pesticides and everything that we have no idea what they do to people and when we find out what they do to people we're going to throw them away, we're going to fucking dump that information so you never even know, you got people have we have so much round up in our piss that we could like write our names in the grass and it would stick there uh because it would kill all the fucking uh uh blades and and it kills people, it like gives you cancer, but that's just the breaks and it's like there has to be a moment of absorbing and recapitulating and like rationalalizing the phenomenon as it emerges, which is happened with all the things I'm describing, um, which means that um, this is just going to be like a more open and more dramatic uh uh and probably more contested, i fucking hope more contested uh pro process uh and the degree to which that's uh going to be true or not is the degree to which they're going to get away with it is the degree to which we let them, i mean in broad sense like in in descriptive sense and not in not in a judgemental sense like if we let them it's not that word makes it seem like it's our fault but it's not because we don't have the tools and the question is whether we can build them and there's no certainty we will be able to we might be able to we might not uh, but it won't be our fault, but it will be because we didn't stop them in like the narrow deterministic sense, uh, but that's what they're going to try to do, now that might not happen, like one of the big reasons is they're going to open up again, states, states are saying that they're going to open up right now, what if I mean, people, people have to work, but people don't have to be consumers, they really don't, they don't have to go to Chiles, now a lot. you know these yolles who show up with the shotguns and the AR15s in front of the sate caples uh to shoot someone i don't even know uh you know that's interesting the guns at those are really more interesting than the guns at like the uh the rallies where they're trying to like because the guns at the the culture war rallies that have been before this and these guys are all copying the guns are there presumably to protect them from the antiifa right antifa antiifa uh but now when they were testing this uh these covid uh closings, there's no antifa, the antifa kids are all cucks, they're home, they're actually quarantining, so the only people there are the the the medical uh staff who once again aren't ordering people to do anything, they're just trying to protect, they're trying to save lives who are better being lost by the actual existence of the virus, and the police officers who are actually enforcing uh the laws, so once again what is the... law for, i mean, what is the gun for? what is the why do you have a gun? why do you have a gun? and if they thought i don't even know if they would answer because i think it's just cuuse i'm doing a protest. like like you would ask somebody at a protest why you're holding a sign, you know, i think that's it, it's like they're expressing, they're they're expressing their latent uh, their political power and their latent unspoken willingness to uh go beyond the ballot as it work, but of course it's for most of them a bluff, and yes, it's a pacifier, it's a binky, like you, they don't even know what they're what? what they're carrying it for because it's that deeply ingrained as a totem of strength that they don't actually possess. but yeah, and technology is going to be part of it. uh, they're going to track the track and tray stuff, that's like literally tracing people, and then because i mean realist. tically uh these guys are gonna, i mean if the technology exists and it looks like it probably does, if you can do like large-scale testing and tracing, which of course Trump uh resisted uh uh trump resisted um uh testing because he wanted to keep the numbers down because he he doesn't he has a child's understanding of everything which means you know like he he understands at one level axis level he understands that like you and i like uh Trump and and any other president or any other person would understand a large number of people with the the disease is bad to have we all understand that most people because that information is connected to a a foundation of presumptions that lead to it and have been worked through, know then that if the number high number of of people with this is bad then the way to prevent the number from going. is to intervene some way to stop the spread. Trump, he understands the the mirror idea that a high number is bad, but because he has not done any thinking to get there and couldn't if he wanted, I mean maybe if he really thought, if you really concentrated, he could get there, but it would take him weeks to get to even one like banall statement of of truth, that's how un unreflective his life is, that's how... un how un um how little work he has done into examining any of the structures of thought that uh he he operates under so he sees numbers bad and he thinks well that don't okay well if you test people they're going to come up with more numbers so don't test them and then the number won't go up and so they told people don't test and that is it's like it's that's the difference between an idiot responding to situation and somebody who has actually thought through what the situation. even though they can agree on uh like that that's why i'm so annoyed by the binary getting annoyed with the binary way we discuss rightness and wrongness about ideas because it leads us to argue on the wrong the wrong planes and the wrong terms like big number is bad is something that both trump and you know say uh uh j insley or you know somebody considered a confident response to this south korean president uh they all know big number bad so they're both right about that. It's just that there that Trump is wrong and how he got there, his presumptions are wrong, and so you and so you have to pick like the level where the wrongness is to uh to get at where the mistake has been made, like the original branching off into uh uh into uh just premises that will lead you inevitably to the wrong thing, but anyway um, I forgot what I was saying about that, but yeah Trump'. wants the number to go down uh and that's why it resisted testing, but now it's inevitable, you're going to need testing because that's the only way you could possibly reopen things and the best way you could reopen things to solve two problems, you got to solve two problems by reopening, and they're only solving one right now, and we'll see how much the effect there is that you can, you can say things are open and your businesses can open, and if you work at those businesses, you got to go to work because you had a $1200 stimulus check and nothing fuck all else. you probably lost your healthcare insurance, health insurance and you might get a deadly virus at any minute, uh, so you um, so you will go to work, but you can't make people go and patronize the businesses, you can't make people go to the restaurants, and go to the bars and go out, if they think the thing is real, and most people do, they're going to be worry about that, and even if they go out, it's going to be for less time, they're going to spend. less money, it's like you have to make them feel comfortable about getting out too, so I think what they're going to find is the only way that they can square the circle, like I've said, the real way to fix this is to war communism, the economy. and create direct provision and like essentially suspend capitalism and and uh and you could, you could do that, don't ask me how, and I guarantee you if I got enough people in a room we can figure it out, uh, since that's not going to happen because it would undermine capitalism and got to mind the markets, we have to get back and America's a consumer service industry economy, we can't, it's not like you can go, oh, if these were factories is the thing, um, if these are factories um then it would be no problem, like if we had an industrial economy uh, you can make them go back to the factories and then you're done, you're producing the thing and you can send it out and it'll be sold somewhere, but but then it still doesn't volve the service industry economy, when the service industry is such a huge, huge uh chunk of our economy, then the demand, any kind of significant demand shortfall will result in stain suppression and contraction and they don't have any intervention for that or they want one, so they have to prevent it, and if you have this deadly virus out there, and then you're finding out, oh yeah, by the way, uh, you can be like totally healthy and it just can suddenly start curdling your blood and then you get a fucking stroke at like 35, i mean if that keeps happening and there's no reason to believe it won't as the death b rises and the number of people who get it rise, people are going to want to fucking do that uh, i'm just saying if you work in the economy. don't have a service industry, you get rid of the fucking, you're not doing it anymore, you're getting rid of you're just it's it's it's supply chains replacing uh uh uh the market, jesus christ, um, so to fix both ends of that equation, to get the back at or work and to get people out of their houses to patronize the businesses, they're going to have to be they're going to have to like they're going to have to take the suppression like all these basically if you if you if you strip down to it and you ask them all those people protesting at those state capitals if you were to like make them break down their belief system on what this is and you got to exclude the ones who think that it's not a real virus because that's that's an incommenserability beyond your ability to breach but if they believe the virus is real and it is as deadly as it is presented so you got to start with those people and that is going to be a subsection but "if you got them down and they admitted that, then what they're basically arguing for is, this is slavery that we have to be kept in our homes, freedom would be if people who are sick had to stay in their homes and I got to go out, and that is a perfect capsule description of the American conception of freedom since the founding of the country, that is what liberty is, it's a ex x amount of work has to be done, x amount of surveillance must be maintained, x amount of discipline must be enforced, x amount of misery must be inflicted essentially to maintain this social structure. it is unfair to me a liberty is being being infringed, freedom is being undermined, the degree to which I must feel it, and then the reason for that is because there are people who deserve to feel it, and more than me. or in a binary sense, they do and I don't, and of course that's where slavery, the several colonial mindset of like the justification is the difference between me and you, that is what, and it's in my head, but it's what justifies the imposition of the social costts, the externalities, the external miseries created by building a social order, maintaining it on to you, and that is freedom, because I, because I'm here, don't deserve to have these things infringe, imposed on me. they do and that's where you know that's that's that's the basis for the fucking uh the xenophobia stuff and so the next like group that's going to enter into the pantheon of others who deserve to have this stuff happen to them will be people who are sick with corn with corvid corved uh bill corbit no the people who have it because if you can if you have robust testing which we could do we really with the fucking pedal to the metal, uh, then you could get a better map of where it is, and then and it when it did emerge, you could get it quickly and then button it up, and then if that went with tracing where those people are, and enforcing through full legal means quarantine on them, that would be uh, freedom to the people doing the protesting, that would be, that would be liberty uh, now people are talking about how... there's no antibodies blah blah blah whatever not talking about we don't know any about that stuff and honestly it wouldn't matter because this is all about uh corvet burnson this is all what uh what they have to do and like i say if even after then because of lack of antibodies, there's still a higher mortality, it will be incorporated, it has to be. i'm just talking about the general contours, and so even though the the imposition on the person, like here we got a thing where there's a light load on everybody, it's not that hard, there's a light load on anybody, i guess i'd say this, there's a light load on everyone who is under quarantine, there's a heavy, there's a light load and everyone under quarantine because we placed a heavier load on the people still have to work in essential industies, so we had like x amount of like general liberty, now we have less and it's been dis it's been displaced onto essential workers, but even that thin amount of liberty imposition on quarantine people with bullshit jobs uh, but but a a basement full of ar15s uh is too much because any basically, and so their solution would be take this small amount that I have to feel and place it onto this larger category of people suffering from COVID, and they will have their freedoms restricted even more than the fucking central workers uh uh had or certainly we all had collectively under quarantine, now you are tracked and traced and can be arrested, I guarantee you in a situation like... that the penalties would get stuffer, would get more severe because the need to main in order to maintain the system of individuals to stay home, because these aren't just people under quarantine and these are people who are positive uh, they will and they will dehumanize them, look at John Cornon saying like you know 50% of COVID deaths the're they had underlying conditions like obesity and heart disease and it's like dude that's all of your constituents and everyone and it's like they all know they all they don't think of it that way because they're not going to get it so like you you see that you're like what how would a fat person who lives in Texas and it's not like there are any and likes cornon, how's he going to read that? he doesn't read that and say your life is matters less because you were overweight? no, because that fucking loser had covid and i don't, and i won't get it, so yeah, like that's what American liberty has always meant, it has meant the extent to which i am free of the burdens required to perpetuate the the circumstances of my uh civilization. and that's why and that's where these it's like it it it is like i think that uh very little things are actually hypocritical uh i don't think hypocrisy is real honestly i feel like either uh one like hypocrisy of like uh of like believing in a thing and acting a different. way, I don't think that's hypocritical, because as I said, believing a thing doesn't mean anything, it's your acting out of the thing that you believe, which means that like for example, if you're a Christian fundamentalist who has an affair and checks off, that doesn't mean, that's none of that negates you being a Christian, and being a Christian doesn't negate you having chacked off or cheated, so like the hypocrisy, I don't, I don't think that the idea there, is that well, if you are this, you'll never do that, and I don't think that that's realistic, because the doing that is is everything, the thinking that is only afterwards, um, and it's incorporated either way, and in things like this, like these kind of ideas, like these ideological contradictions, like, oh, you, you got a gun, but you think black got police lives matter, it's like, that's not a hypocrisy, because their definition of liberty is such, that liberty is other people who deserve it, bearing a burden of... of of of policing and authoritarianism and exploitation that I because they have it coming in some fundamental way, they brought it about, and so and that's I mean you want to talk about protestantism being like a key piece of software or a key right, one of the most important lines of code that went into the the development of America uh is that that really one of the only ways to make sense of that is... if you believe that uh that you could know who deserves anything in this world, and of course it's like racism is an easy way to do it visually because it just carries a lot of shit with it, but before you even get to racism you get to uh fortune, you get to who's happy, who's successful, who is where they are, if God controls all, then those who are pleased, those who... sit in the positions of respect and and uh prosperity, why? why would God let them be there if he didn't want them there? if they were believers of course uh and it's like you can argue about how that's not really what was in calvinism and it wasn't but like you know there in Buddhism like how many forms of Buddhism have like gods and like them guys I mean it's it's all syncratic all religion is syncretic so so like whatever pure strain theory that Nerd Kelvin was talking about with predestination and stuff whatever the hell that is the the the the the... uh the American uh settler was not operating on anything that refined, they were operating on, you shall know him by his uh, his his shit basically, and so that means if you got COVID and I didn't, that was, I mean somebody made that happen, if you're black and I'm white, somebody choose to put the mark of Kane on you, or the mark of ham on you, uh, so if you're if you live in Guatemala and I live in the United States uh and you're the one that gets the death squads that my country pays for. I did not get a haircut. I might, I might shave my head. I don't know, might do it, might not. people want to know if Aoc sucks now, once again I feel like these are the terms that we should not think in, if somebody does something you don't like, like Aoc did a fucking pariscope with Warren today, and it's like, oh god, and the idea is like if you don't like that, and that is, it's like there's an amount you cannot like that that will like guarantee, okay, I have now brown out this person as bad, this person's in the bad bind, and that doesn't really help you in any. way because they're still around and you still have to deal with them, the question is always, uh, is Aoc useful, and that and that is an independent question of whether she's good or not, she might be a celebrity liberal, I think she probably is, but I can't know, we're all dividing chicken bones, we're all looking at entrails and trying to figure out if we know these people we never can, we can't even know ourselves, how the fuck are we going to know all these other people, ah this person's actually a celebrity craving liberal, this person's actually a... real true believer, you will never know, you will never know, you know them by their actions, their collamor, their collection of actions, and that shouldn't make you have an idea of what the what's inside of them, it should give you an idea of what to expect from them, and those are different things, because what to expect from them imposes the idea that it's going to be contextualized, that every given moment is going to have a context that will determine what the right thing to do is, that is different than saying uh uh bad, that means that no matter what's happening, there's no situation where this person should ever be engaged with, and that I think is, I mean, I'm not talking about it morally being wrong, I think that it's just the wrong way to think about things, I think it's a way that it's too brittle, it's too two-dimensional, I would say that I don't trust Aoc because of her past actions, I will continue to not trust her, but I will uh acknowledge her reality of existence and deal with it. and what that means doesn't mean uh uh thinking she's a girl boss or saying that she's never going to do anything wrong or that she's always going to do everything wrong right nothing it doesn't imply anything other than um then that i'm going to have a certain like expectation i'm going to uh consult when i'm like processing a given specific situation is felix in here felix is in the stream oh my god I didn't see the Felix was in here, there he is, he's crying, say hi, what, what up though, hey buddy, what's up buddy, how you doing, not bad, what's going on, I'm just doing uh, just wrapping, just wrapping with the squad. let me let me put in, let me get my earbuds so i can have better audio for this, i'm just uh, i'm done with all my tasks for today, i did them all, what the fuck did i put these, i own like three things and i fucking lose them all the time, oh yeah, i know, i know, they're probably in my code pocket, your jewel, how many times you losing your jewel, no no, i don't lose. i don't lose my vape anymore cuz it's like it's no one yeah it's too uh it's too specy yeah it well it's like bright orange like fucking look at this shit oh um, like half the time that jewel would be like stuck to your arm or something, well that that was the problem with the jewel and that's like one of the reasons I don't use it anymore, yeah, where the fuck did i put this, I like literally just fucking bought these, I like got them like dude, I went to, I went to Dwaine Reed because I needed new headphones and there, there was this woman in front of me in line who is like, fucking basically screaming at the cashier for not having a mask and he was like trying to be nice and he was like yeah uh i told them we need masks and they don't like have clean ones for me and she was like she was like you what i do you understand you that thing that people do a service employees were the like oh you understand i don't think you understand and i was like in a bad mood because i was resetting my sleep cycle like it was the only reason i was in it fucking cbs and or Dwaine read at 8 am and i just like flipped out, i was like uh, he already fucking answered you, like why are why are you fucking why are you like hectoring this poor guy? and she was like, uh, she's like, three of my friends have covid, and i just lied and i was like, yeah, mine too, you shouldn't act like that, i just fucking lied, but it's like someone's like, that's like the worst thing you can do is like just be awful to some fucking minimum wage guy. and be like, oh, it's buse my friends have covid, like fuck you, she deserved for me to lie to her, yeah, no, fuck that lady, yeah, people, people love, people love screaming at each other, like put bath on and uh, call the cops, everyone's getting a chance to uh, just get, yeah, no, they just like, okay, i found them, i found them, they were accent a coffee table, good place to put them, there we go, no, yeah, they like, i mean this is like no, i'm not like anti lockdown or anything, but it is like, i think like people are kind of right that it is alarming how quickly people could just use this to like turn on other people or like just rat like lock it into their pre-existing thing of screaming at service workers and normal people or whatever, yeah well before you got on, i was actually talking about this, i was talking about my my idea, my theory is that like if they develop the able to produce enough tests and get enough tracing going that they're going to just like are the next like people we hate are going to be people with COVID, yes we're going to get rid of the quarantine on everybody else and then people with it are going to get like you know gun to your head can't leave your house shit and then it's going to be yeah fuck them fuck you it's like yeah it's i mean for a while there i'm like stupidly optimistic about some things and for like just a week or two weeks, I was like, yeah, I mean like more people that I've that I haven't talked to in a while are contacting me and like people seem to be talking to their families more and that's nice and like maybe this will make like a lot of people less awful and insane, people are still doing that, but I didn't realize how quickly it would just become another awful thing, another thing that you slide pre-existing awful behaviors into, yeah, yeah, no, that's the thing, yeah, like changing situations don't really change people, you just apply your pre-existing shit. to the situation, yeah, yeah, yeah, we always, we assign like mystical qualities to both time and situation, as if there were no, there are no like overriding characteristics prior to that, we think that time is, time and both trauma are forces that work for us for however we want them, yeah, like, oh, we're uh, we're gna face this together. and it's all going to it's like the way the day everything changed it's like no no the day you were just the same asshole as before that's why that that like so like if i've identified like one message of the biden campaign it's like when America comes together it can accomplish anything and it's like i couldn't realize i didn't realize like quite why like that hit me on such like a fucking gross me on spiritual level and i think it was you remember that story from like a two weeks back about that like poor fucking woman who she just signed up to work at a grocery store she was young and she wanted to just like help people during covid and her she just died and her last paycheck was for like $9 like something just fucking insulting and i realized why it like it it it irritated me so much it was because it's like well people are coming together and like a lot of people a lot of people who are like in very precarious economic spots or whatever like they're they're like, yeah, no, I won't go out, I won't fucking do any of this, I will like risk homelessness, I will, or in the most extreme example like this one, like I will literally risk death and I will die, people during this and it's like no people are doing that, they just don't get shit for it, like it isn't incentivized or rewarded in the slightest without uh ppe, there's a guy like the asshole in philadelphia who bought the hanaman hospital and closed it to make it and it's like hey can we reopen it's yeah for a million bucks yeah you like you don't have to tell like fucking like working class people what like oh you have to come together like they are but he's literally literally just it's i figured out what he actually means he means that like his suburban voters could be friends with their Trump voting unkles again that's it yeah no that's it everybody shakes hands over the over their barbecue waves in each other uh yeah gets to stop fighting about trump after all yeah it's such a fucking unbelievable cynical but it's like i i think that's like if anything is going to like turn suburban people out it's that's what the actually care about, yeah, no, that's what they care about, and the thing is like people talk about things getting worse, making people more possible of organizing, it's like no, people just things are miserable, but the but the flip side is is yes, things are getting worse, but people are like by definition having to come closer together just to survive because of how much worse things are getting, and if anything good happens it's going to be because of that, yeah, yeah, absolutely, i like, yeah, i don't know what changes. yeah, i like i have no idea, yeah, well we're hoping, i'm i'm just hoping people like rediscover the value of uh, you know uh, non-market transactions, i guess, you know, how like with less money and less and less ability to do anything, and like you're going to depend more on people helping you in ways that aren't fucking uh putting your hand in each other's pockets, you're gna actually have to like great yeah and i do want to see like i don't want to just be pessimistic like i've seen a lot of that i've seen like i don't i've seen a lot of people like go out of their way including like people i've never known to really do that but it is i don't know it just it just it it sucks that like the main political message of this year will be like let's stop fighting over trump let's come on jack it sucks it fucking sucks god and now even like even the even the phony me to feminists have now realized they can't ignore the preponderance of evidence and so now they're like yeah i guess biden is a rapist but oh jeez that's yeah what what can i do? oh well that's just you like you've admitted that you think it sucks it fucking sucks oh god and now even like even the even the... only me to feminists have now realized they can't ignore the preponderance of evidence and so now they're like yeah i guess fighting is a rapist but oh jeez that's yeah what what can i do? oh well that's just you've like you've admitted that your entire like the thing you claim to be fighting for this whole time means nothing and now you're supposed to get people to actually engage with this process well that is i think that's like a silver lining of... the biden presidency and like if i was going to try to sell it to someone i'd say like that is going to be the end of that type of media because like seriously like no one reads it and like biden like what you the biden people don't have any fucking use for that like you're going to tell like biden's not going to talk about bodies and spaces he's never talk about bodies and spaces no yeah and it's like also the retreat of liberals from like any type of like cultural or political struggle because that all that's all. do it's just going to like give people at least like 10 million people the permission to stop giving a shit about any of this? no for to totally no i honestly could percy i mean forgetting the fucking i mean first you have the reality of of the virus but beyond that i could see just a gap in participation like we could we could go under 50% easily turnous easily and then like yeah when that like look when i see like ken vog post shit about like - i i mean that's the logical end point of all this that everything gets subsumed and go opted when i see team vogue be like y'all we're doing leninism today it's like yeah that's not going to that's it's they're going to go back to what they were like three like two years from now b in wins because it's like you can't keep this up there won't be a market for that anymore people will go back to just posting about fucking cw shows yeah yeah they'll bring back firefly finally that's all we'll talk about. Yep, yeah, I mean, I do think a Biden presidency would be hilarious, like I'm excited for it in that aspect, it's going to be really fucking funny, so funny, it'd be so funny. just and like what's what's what's hunter gonna do? oh my god, what if hunter smokes crack in the way has? that would be amazing. i would love that. i would absolutely love that. oh my god, he is, i mean like, yeah, he could he could sell crash the white house, like what about that? yes, yes, he's going to, oh man, that's gonna be hil, like that's also going to be weird, just never seeing the president. nope, nope. well he'll be like fucking diaclean behind the fucking uh uh curtain only only his like closest units and retainers will come near him yeah i mean and that is so when i when i thought about was going to lose and i got really into the idea of him and i got that idea for like the by the nobel i did think of him as this like awful person but tragic figure yeah but and now like then when it's like he he became clear to be the nominee, it was like how that doesn't work anymore, but i actually think it does now because like if he becomes president he will preside over the fall of the American empire more than Trump did, absolutely, he would be, he will be forget diacletian, he'll be fucking uh ronus augustus, yes, yes, that could really happen, and it would make sense, and like, yeah, like your version of him makes most sense as like the the grave digger of empire, yeah, it's like the... finally give him the job for seniority, like sorry, show's over, this guy tried to get this job and was such an asshole betrayed any good thing in him to get this, and he finally got it at a point when his brain didn't work anymore, and like that's that's a fucking perfect, like twilight zone ironic ending, it's perfect, it's absolutely perfect, it's exactly how it's exactly how these? these things go, yep, g, movies are gonna be good again though, i think uh, i probably not, the toss up, because i feel like there's both, like the trump obviously has this massive economic crisis, but if people blame it on China, it won't matter, you know, yeah, yeah, like the rule of history has always been true, the economy is bad, the president loses and that is the fact, but no president has ever had something that they could totally. externalize the blame onto like the great depression, the fucking crash and there was no way that explanation of it that kept you out of it as like the uh the party now he can say china did it and if enough people believe him then he somehow search the fact that he's presiding over the sex yeah and it's it's like it's one of those rules that i don't think you have to follows super closely because it's like, well Nate Silver loves these, he's like, a candidate who's won in South Carolina by x margin, has never lost the president, and it's like those, your sample size for that is like just the 20th century really, exactly, election, and so like yeah, the what you yeah, what you just said about how like every previous example, there are no externalities they can blame it on, and also like... um, yeah, it's it's not really comparable in scale, but there was, there was like a bit of downturn in 197 or 1987 and 1988, and George W. Bush still fucking won, yeah, but um, yeah, I mean, I do, I think it's a tous too, I i could see the ways in which Biden loses very clearly, it's a little bit harder to see how he would win, but just... my non scientific evaluation of it where it's like it's the most funny and like sort of tragic and shitty outcome in some ways outcome and that has generally been the truest outcome so far yeah i think it's a good it's a better rubric than anything else because the sample size is about the same yeah yeah oh i was just thinking uh so i uh the biden shift. what was i can say oh god damn it's something that biden uh ah never mind fuck it was good never mind my brain stopped my brain is not doing uh but the yeah it's uh the sample size is so fucking small that you might as well just say the funniest thing should happen which would be winning funniest thing happened with like brakes it and trump those are both like oh what if they actually like won yeah and then holy shit happened. yeah, holy shit, it fucking happened, brexit was like brexit was awesome because like it was supposed to be a referendum in david cameron like yeah, fine, whatever, yeah, like fucking do your stupid vote. it's like oh we bloody passport passport and that country is awesome because they are just like going down the fucking tubes and the they just love it they love it they're so happy to finally die with boris like thank god let me die it's it is like the bor like he love boris in that it's suck like their country sucks and it's like like he's a big sticky oath like hates it's all all poor people and they're like, oh that adorable rogue, it's because they have been bred to worship the most disgusting amongst them, like that's what did to them, like that is in their blood, yes, yes, and i think i mean we're we're kind of, i mean we kind, i think that's where where liberals are at now, like yeah, i don't think that they they're yet in a position to openly love biden, but i think in like a generation or even like... years, like they're they're working themselves up to it, the worship of the Obama family is like he's always been very erk some to me for those reasons, but oh, just remember uh, Boris Johnson, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Joe Biden running for president, oh right, the way he could win uh is if the sub'. have really turned on Trump the way so far have appeared to, because between the primary and 2018, the suburbs did a real hard swing, and if that is this, if that's sustained, then it doesn't matter that the that I do believe that you will see a drop in uh in a voter turnout, but it will be made up for for the democrats by a big swing in the in the suburbs, but Oh, I can't hear you, I can't hear him. Okay, oh, sorry, my my, no, I was saying, I could definitely I could definitely see that, like that's that's a great example of how it could, how it could happen, and like all their messaging and all their models seem to be geared towards that, yeah, because like, they at the end of the day they do dislike that Trump is rude, they do not like the stuff fans like, like they are, they'. find it embarrassing, they watch liberal media, they are, they are NFNL, Jimmy Fallen, they are in the stow of cucktom so much that they do find him uh embarrassing as president, and then that makes them not trust him, and that makes them think that he's doing a bad job, it makes it more likely to believe that he's dumb and that he did something. it's it is like the bor like he love boris in that country and the it's no yeah yeah and like people the the praise of biden from concert like you know like Jennifer. conservatives, i mean i don't even know what the fuck to, i mean she is no, Boris Johnson, joe biden, donald trump, joe biden running for president, oh right, the way he could win uh is if the suburbs have really turned on Trump the way, so far have appear to, because between the primary and 2018, the suburbs did a real hard swing and if that is this, if that's sustained, then it doesn't matter that the that I do believe that you will see a drop in a voter turnout, but it will be made up for for the democrats by a big swing in the in the suburbs, but oh I can't hear you, I can't hear, okay, oh sorry, no, I was saying, I could definitely, I could definitely see. like that's that's a great example of how it could how it could happen and like all their messaging and all their models seem to be geared towards that yeah because like the... at the end of the day they do dislike that Trump is rude, they do not like the stuff his footing fans like, like they are, they find it embarrassing, they watch liberal media, they are, they are NSNL, Jimmy Fallen, they are in the stow of cucktom so much that they do find him uh embarrassing as president, and then that makes them not trust him, and that makes them think that he's doing a bad job, it makes them more likely to believe that he's dumb and that he did something out of incompetence. and so they are like this guy and and like Biden is obviously senile but he is not he's still a he's still a politician in a way they recognize as politicians, and now they realized after four years that they actually do care about that, no, like, oh, like, deeper than I thought, I actually care about this, no, yeah, yeah, and like people, the the praise of Biden from concert, like you, like Jennifer. conservatives, i mean i don't even know what the fuck to, i mean she is a conservative, but i don't even know what you would just call that belief, he is so liberal monarchist, but uh, it is like there's this mass, whenever joe biden does something that's like it's basically a form where he like wishes condolences or something, they're like, what if we had a president like this, and it's like, oh, that's what all this is about, yeah, literally what this is about, i mean talk about like when you know. yeah, when i hate to relate to relate to this to games, but metal gear solidfy the phantom being, oh yes, it's about a group of people who experienced a incredibly convuted pot that they believe was engineered to betray them, and they go so insane with the desire for revenge that they mere the actions of their opposing group, but they just due to like cultural shivels and uh, you know, arbitrary reasons that people use, like no, it's good when we do it. like in Joe Buden, it's amazing how much he mirrors Donald Trump, way more than he like, family self-dealing and crookedness, like sex crimes now, uh, just pompous, like not that smart, trips over his own words, senile and like a huge history of rais mating in the 70s and it's like, no, yeah, literally, yeah, none of.... none of this mattered, none of the stuff that they try to hit Trump and the left with, let's be honest, in 2017 with, they never believed in it, they just cared about the the few signifiers where they could tell themselves they're not doing uh trump shit, but it is like all things is joe biden, even the victory is a tragedy, yeah like one of the reasons this feels like the end of things coming is because like this does feel like he could be the last president whoever it is is that uh Trump and Biden, one of the ways, one of the many ways that they are very, very similar is that they both perfectly embody the the the content and history coming up to now of the political parties, yes, Trump is the history of the modern republican party, you trace the straight line from from uh goldwater to to Nixon uh to Reagan, you threat it through George W. Bush, uh, you hook in for some Schwarzenegger, you add some Sarah Palin and boom, you are at Trump, like the like the movement, like the creation of like this white uh suburban base that is totally mediated and creates like a bike like a spectacle culture around itself that that turns into you know by uh fox news and limbaw and turns into a pure moment of you know agreement which has to be embodied by a literal performer and famous person, meanwhile Biden is the the he emerges in the moment that the democratic party starts turning away from the the new deal uh in in the 70s, he emerges as like the embodiment of the neoliberal term, so he is the entire last 40 years of Democratic party as neoliberalism has been has sapped everything of energy and vitality and slowly desiccated and turned into this flailing, weaezing, decrepit old man, and he comes from a perfect place, delaware, a land without really any characteristics or anything distinct, literally just it's a tax haven, it's America. switzerland, he comes from the perfect, and i i said this in the show we did today, but uh, it bears repeating, you all those like awful breathless articles in 2016 by by liberal media that were like uh, trump is the mirror of America, he's he's vein and race, and it's like so is Biden, of course he is, he's a guy who sucks at everything, has only made bad choices, uh, probably. yeah, probably a fucking sex creep, and he just gets the job because he showed up the most times and the right people liked him. in that fucking party is like it's their turn except for the upstart obama who is sort of like the mirror Trump just in that he was the guy manipulated the media enough to like skip the line but now he's been totally processed into that thing now like Obama's not as much of that establishment as any of them uh and they're all like just carbon copies of each other they're just different like skin like uh they've been reskinned like Obama has like the capernick skin that like pisses off white suburbanites and then Biden has like this fake patty Irish skin that like makes them kind of like him more, yes, that's it, and I always think, I think it's very telling, like I was thinking about how warren liberals talk about Obama, and they're like, he will, he inspired me to get into politics, but I just, I wish he, I wish he, you know, he was stronger, and it's like, no, he's stronger than anyone in that party, but the, it's not for his believes, it's for himself, yeah, he is, he is a cut'. fucker, but for himself, and they never, the warren people will never fucking get that, even though like warren fought that, like the the good things she did, we're fighting that administration, they still don't fucking get it, yeah, yeah, like, he's refusing to death, he's, he's like, no, if I'm president, that's like grabbing excalibur, I'll like live forever, because no one forgets the president, no, like as long as... he wins and dies in office, he will have achieved immortality, so that could be the last thing he thinks is his fucking brain shuts down. Obama, like yeah, it really sucks how well Obama is going to make out of because like if the empire collapses, people's memory will be like, that was the last great president, he will be the one that people like look back, fondly on, he'll be the cult figure, he'll be an icon, they'll be like cults around him, it's like - it will be very depressing, even though he's the guy's more responsible for it than anyone. yeah, the guy you saw all this company coming and was like, let's get Larry Summers on the case, like just a complete operator, a complete fucking selfish prick, and and no, yeah, he gets, I mean, this is probably more than he, he even ever dreamed of, that he gets to, he gets to be historical, that's what people think 200 years from now, the last great president, he could have saved the empire. yeah, god that sucks, oh so tragic, it really fucking sucks, god, Bernie will be like, you know, it'll be people, some people think of him like a debs figure, probably not, you know, they'll, but he'll never get the things he did to fight Obama, that kept Obama from executing his worst acts of austerity and cynicism, that won't be. recorded, they'll just be like, he got a lot of energy in the party, yeah, oh fuck, pooky ideas, yeah, but yeah, but we love remember like like debs or like uptinclair, for governor of California 1934 on basically like a plan to abolish capitalism to fix the uh great depression, yep, uh, I'm going, I'm going to record a solo on it this week, oh, that sounds good, reading a book on it, and that'... that election is just uncanly like that ours, and i think people will remember sandre similarly is like a goof ball, a good know what he was up against, no, yeah, that's it's unfortunate, yeah, i mean, none of the, no one, i mean, this is a weird time to think about because i don't think anyone's really going to remember anything from this time, i feel like we're this is a period, it's probably the most well-recorded. 15-year stretch of history ever, and yet, no, everything, no one will remember really anyone from this time, they'll remember very little art, uh, I'm almost, my uh, my my hour is almost up so I got to get off, but I got to quickly say this, uh, imagine how much will be forgotten, because we haven't written anything down, everything is on servers, what if the servers go down, yes, that's a good point, this will be, even though it's the most recorded time in history, when the people are trying to figure out... what happened in retrospect, there will be huge huge gaps because it will all have been destroyed. yes, yeah, i do want to say someone in chat said what is this based on who can predict the future? obviously no one, yeah, i'm just saying if things continue on this trend line, that's what i feel will happen, but i, you know, no way of knowing, we have no way of knowing, and i'm a very big philip k dick guy, and philip k dick uh, his thing about the future was, it is actually. futile to predicted because the things that will there's so much, there's you won't even understand what the factors are going to be, no, it's it's sort of futil to predict the future, we do it. anyway cuz it's fun even though yeah, entertainment, but it's certainly like we we sray when we start thinking that it has any kind of real power, no yeah, basically that it should form actions, like we should not be acting anything will happen, we have to act like in the moment, we can't like assume Trump is going to lose or biden is going to lose or anything, yes, you got to operate for much earlier assumptions than that, because you can't know, that yeah, no, um, i mean the... I if if I could make if I was uh head of the department of education, the two things I would make every child read, the golden man, which is the best short story ever written, and ecclesiasties, golden man being about how you you cannot understand the idea.
