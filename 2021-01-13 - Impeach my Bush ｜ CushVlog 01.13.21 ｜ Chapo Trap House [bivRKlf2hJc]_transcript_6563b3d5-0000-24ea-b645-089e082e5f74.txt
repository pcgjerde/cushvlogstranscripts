 fucking on my titties like you want me, calling me all the time, the teeches and peaches, fuck the pain away, fuck the pain away. did they do it, did they impeach him, did they do the impeachment? did they hold him accountable? that's what really matters, i watch some of it, i watched the speeches, one real uggos in congress, some of the ugliest people i've ever seen in my life, couple of cuties, but by and large. Beasts, hideous, just freaks uh, also just the stupidest fucking dollars, just absolute both sides, mouth a gape, losers, just dumb asses, like half of those guys look like panicky, they sounded like panicky uh auctioners, or like they were they were, they recited their speech in front of the mirror for 50 for an hour beforehand, and like we're practicing all their stupid hand gestures, pathetic, the losers, folks, the losers, but beyond that, one thing I did get is that accountability must be uh, must be attained, we have to have accountability, the president must be held accountable, but of course the grim comedy of that is that the job description of the president is that they are not accountable, if people who reach that level of power, that level of... criminality, which go together, are accountable to the system, then why would anybody who makes up its sinuws uh, take the job? and they need these people, they need the faces, so the president can't be held held accountable, very notion is absurd, the very notion, it's it's like holding a, it's like holding a hurricane accountable. can't do it, the title is a peach's reference, yes, remember those, remember her, from the bush arrow, but apparently whatever they vote, and I guess they're probably going to do party lones, like four republicans voting for, so it's going to pass and then it will be taken up, I think in the senate by McConnell, like an hour before the inaugural, so they might on, I'm wondering, they probably won't. do it at that point like they're wait, they're essentially waiting like for the thing to uh calm down. one thing i will say that i feel like i'm being vindicated on for everyone says uh you don't know what you're talking about, you've been wrong about everything, is that they've already decided that there's going to be 20,000 troops in uh dc for the inaugural, they're betted out, they're bunked up in the fucking capital right now, so they're they're going to be polite but firm, you had your little tantrum. Now how do you feel? bad, still? Well, at this point it's tough shift, tough shit, we really cannot afford to deindulging you anymore, sorry, but of course that doesn't mean the end of stocastic violence, it will only be the beginning, and at every level, as I have said and will say, it will be encouraged by the state security apparatus, and what fighting fascism will mean will be backing the Biden administration as they extend the war on terror domestically. That's it, that's all that will have, like this impeachment thing, you can argue all day about why it's necessary, but who is this convincing, if it's about isolating the trumpist uh rump from regular Americans who care about the country, shouldn't there be something for them to care about, and it's kind of amazing seeing people who have sort of laid in the cut, when asked to do stuff about... uh progressive actual you know policy ideas deciding that now is the time for symbolic action and that this is symbolically important, i mean i think symbolic stuff is jack off all over the place, it's all jack off, oh it's going to let people know they're going to see who's going to see the same fucking web attle dipshits who are already all alied all on their own side, all have decided that uh posting is practice on both or decided that if they're on the queue and outside they're going to bum rush state capitals because they have the fucking uh the fear of God and the love of God in them that we none of us have even if it's delusional and it's based. on just watching too much tv, but it's it's a real motivator, nobody on the left, left, like that's even a thing has a motivation, democratic voters are by and large absolutely cowering and holding uh the hems of everybody, every democrat because they're terrified of being uh of the the republican mob being let loose on them, and so since there's no left, like symbolic actions don't mean anything, but it is interesting that people will say symbolic actions, where are you? your time on this stupid stuff with medicare for all and then say that this impeachment, this is a symbolism that matters. so the thing that might, i don't know, drain the swamp a little bit by giving people an idea that there is something else the government can do other than punish people, now that can go on the back burner uh, holding the president accountable and reminding people about the the fascist menace, that that needs to be a priority, it's uh, it's all very. it's kind of it's all going in a way that is very easy to see, i mean if you can see this turning into this anti-fascism now, this popular front that we're supposed to have with the democrats, if you can see that creating anything other than like patriot act to uh, you know, patriot act to electric boogal literally cuz it'll be about the boogal boys this time, but i don't know what to tell you. because there's no other forces at play, there's nobody in those rooms other than democrats, and whatever these specific desires of any members of that caucus are, they are overwhelmed by the structural incentives of the party itself, and the people who run it, and they kept talking about Liz Chany is the good republican, one of the most blood-thirstyns there are, the daughter of a dynasty of blood. I mean, caring about, I get why people want their feelings to be validated. because that's why they go online to get their feelings validated and they even get it in their head that like sticking up for the validity of the feelings of members of congress is somehow an important thing to do because it what it establishes the stakes, it establishes how dangerous the moment is, as if our anxieties do anything for us but paralyze us. give me a break, give me a break, break me off a piece. I know people were being mean to me on twitter but they're all losers, I pay them no mind, and I certainly am not accepting any uh any insults of my appearance because I know that I'm looking a fresh to death lately, I know it's all it's all coming together, and yes as many have noticed my skin is dewy soft, so enough of that bullshit. Let's get here, let's talk about what's really interesting, what we're all here for, the republic for which it stands baby, the biggest chunk we've read yet, second half of the second part, when the shit really hits the fan, when we get the great upheaval of 1885, we get the uh, we get hey market, we get homestead strike, uh, and we have what is in my mind, my favorite part of... the book so far, and I've enjoyed the book a great deal, uh, one of my favorite parts, my favorite parts so far has been a part where white uh, carries out a examination of the political economy of the western cattle uh, cattle drive, and that makes sense since White's area of specialization is actually western expansion, he's written books about uh the the the establishment of you markets and and political entities in the west. and a movie a book about the railroads, so this is his wheelhouse and so talking about the cattle, very very interesting, uh, and in fact let's start just talking, I want to read a little bit from uh uh, happens, am i back on, somebody call my phone, I guess you're supposed to stop it, but I don't know how, am i back? Oh my god, am I gone? I'm back. Okay, good. Sorry, somebody called my phone. Uh, so let's start talking about uh, the stuff that's in the the first chapter we read, dying for progress, which is all boils down to an a statistic that White points out, which is that throughout the 19th century, a time of America's rapid expansion, it's economic, it's a... eastern Europe, native-born Americans over the course of 19th century got shorter, lived less uh and lived uh and had shorter life expectancies and got frailer and got weaker, they literally got less healthy, they could they weren't thriving, because industrial democracy, the industrial uh, industrial capitalism was literally squeezing the life out of them, and filling them with adulterance and and uh gimcracks and and uh tainted meat and and rotten uh flour and and food is terrible in such small portions basically so the whole rest of the half that we read is sort of reckoning with it's it's about the country reckoning and with and the liberal elite reckoning with the fact that the small holder democracy that had supposedly triumphed after the civil war the the the land of freedom of contract. and individual liberty uh and free labor where where the scurge of slavery had been removed was not creating the prosperity, the broad prosperity it was supposed to, wasn't recreating Lincoln springfield, which uh white points out in the beginning of the book, is the model of like republican uh uh political economy, a small town surrounded by industrious farmers, uh, people, professionals, laborers, uh, 'yoon, none of them terribly poor, very few of them very rich, uh, many of them moving from one field to another, most of them ending up with a home and property, that was the idea, and then by the by the 1880s and 90s you had uh, a south where slavery had been reinstituted under another another name and the economy had completely stagnated, you had uh the eastern cities that were filled with uh, just stock piled with poor immigrants uh, you had everywhere that industrial capitalism was being consolidated, you in the railroads and in steel, you saw massive numbers of injuries and deaths and terrible working conditions for people of all ages and even those farmers who had been given the land, after with the homestead act and all that came after it were uh in many places struggling, especially in the west where unbenounced a lot of people when they started moving uh people out there, oh no, once you get past the hundreth meridian, uh, it basically dries up and there's no water, and the agriculture that we assumed was going to be the basis of this economy is not really possible, and so you end up with this uh economy of you, ponzi, railroad ponzi schemes propping up real estate speculations that usually ended up with people going broke because you can't fucking grow out there, so one way or another it. not going the way it's supposed to, and we talked about how the liberals kind of made their transformation, we're in the process of making their kunian transition from from uh mid-century lasai pharanostrums to a more interventionist model, and i want to actually go to the very end of the last chapter of part two uh, and read a little bit here to uh bring us back to where we were last time talking about. the sort of cri the the the ideological crisis at the heart of like the liberal elite who became the administrators of the administrate the administrators of the bureaucratic state in the 20th century and also the people who made up its media class, its intellectual class and its political class and who had instituted after the civil war a a easy peace on the south with the promise of prosperity for all smoothing over um all social conflicts, well when you know it, the opposite happened, everybody's shrinking, forgot they're fucking shrinking, oh my god, that's not great, so uh, I just want to read this little bit about at the end about how the economists who had gone from being you, classical Ricardo, Adam Smithians, uh, to involving to absorbing like German ideas and then finally the the marginal revolution uh of um that would end up shaping the response of the bureaucratic state to to democracy uh academics here we go most academic social sciences held back as labor and vanguard anti-monopolis pressed forward in the 1890s urging on cooperatives and state-based solutions to the long economic and social crisis. the academics by and large were not willing to join the assault, but neither were they willing to accept a set of liberal doctrines and social arrangements that they had spent their careers in overthrowing. instead they fashioned a new position which emphasized consumption over production, corporations and large scale production over competition and bureaucratic expertise over democratic control. It was a position that some of the older liberals whom antimonopolis at opposed could also embrace. It jetissend Lazair, reduced the scope of individualism and abandoned small government, but it left private property, capitalism, natural rights and elite rule within a restricted democratic framework intact. So that is a perfect little capsule description of liberalism as we have understood it since the progressive era, which was that class of people coming to term. with the failures of uh contract freedom to generate the country that they wanted it to, but the basic premise was because these were people in the property or near property classes who were around the financed capital who were not were invested in the maintenance of capitalism, the assumption is all that all those marxist notions, all those socialist ideas that oh the real root of this is a class conflict that we cannot resolve democratically the difference but between someone who wants to work as little for as much money as possible and someone who wants them to work for as long for as little money as possible, that that is a conflict that can only be decided by force, and in a capitalist system, no matter what we take about democracy, that force is monopolized by capital, and they didn't want to change that, but they did want to keep it, if not more humane, more stable, because this is the aftermath of as we talk about the 1885 of people which saw the largest out up um almost like spontaneous eruption of strikes across the country uh caused by uh the the knights of labor basically getting in over their head because as happened with all of the big labor eruptions in America and most other places honestly they were out of the hands of the formal organizations that they came from the tightes of labor did not want a full-scale confrontation with the state at that point they were they were still very uh they were still new. and they were still unsure of themselves and they were still very cowed by capital and but they were in the middle of this extended economic depression which all of the employers were using as an excuse to, even if they weren't suffering uh their profit suffering to reduce wages and control over work, and so how do we how do we deal with this? well, we get rid of some of this laws i fair bullshit, we regulate the trusts, we distribute some of the the... the uh prophets publicly, but we keep the structure intact, and that has been the model for liberalism ever since, and in the section we read, there are two great examples of how liberal reformist instincts operate in this context where there are people who are embedded in capitalist relations, find self-conscious uh, identification with capital over labor, but also have uh this the sort of sophisticated social uh self-conception that comes with a culturation and civilization uh being refined meant having some sort of or more importantly than being refined that's for the gentleman being um being useful being someone who could contribute to the public debate someone who could be uh administer a state apparatus uh or work with a reform organization, I mean what what what what they prided up more than ever and always have is their own virtue and they sought to affirm their virtue by solving problems that were caused by the system they supported, which meant that their solutions would always exacerbate the problem, and two great. talks about here are Indian policy and prohibition, temperance as it was called back. and he talks about how the allotment system, which was the single like most brutal assault on traditional native American folkways that was ever done out within the confines of like the administrator state and the legal process as opposed to just you genocide, was a reform move, yes of course it was allowed to happen and encouraged because it meant land would be allocated to hungry white settlers, but for the people who pushed it, they saw a future where native Americans, Indians would be physically extinguished from North America if they kept their ways. Carlyle, the founder of the Carlyle Indian school famously said kill the Indians, save the man. and for those guys as cynical as it might have been and as as I said it was only allowed to become a uh a policy because it helped uh it it helped the interest of those who wanted to uh exploit and native native lands, it did point to a real conflict, which was the native way of life was incompatible with turning America into the rationalized checker board of uh private property that we were going about doing, and so the solution for a good-hearted Christian Indian reformer is, well make them have farms, make them settle down, make them farm and be like us, and then they can live as citizens and we don't have to worry about them getting wounded need anytime they decide to start dancing. and in the narrow parameters where the choices, extinguishment versus assimilation, assimilation is the more refined, is the more civilized response, even though it is in its own way genocidal, but that's because it could not, and and its inaction destroyed many native American communities, that is the end result of reform within a system, the reformers are not part of a broader uh press against capital but are within it trying to direct it, it will only compound all the contradictions that are that are they're responding to, and prohibition, temperance is a similar thing, these middle class uh victorian evangelicals were horrified by the drunken uh rabel of the cities who the Irish, Germans and Catholics or the... Irish catholics, Irish germans who would just get shit faced all day when they weren't working 20 hours a week or 20 hours or 12 hours a day, and instead of recognizing that the rise of saloons and the rise of drinking was a direct response to being hyper exploited, which was an untouchable assumption, that to to to work to change that would be to violate sacred concepts of free enterprise and private contract. No, you just uh pass laws so that they can't drink. Irish germans like Tom Hagan. Uh, and there's a example that White gives of the uh the reformers who are able to win temperance in um, Iowa, but then with a with a coalition of you, the more uh, the more refined catholic elements and the middle-class protestants, but then immediately. as soon as soon as uh it was interacted enacted lost their coalition's control because the the immig the immigrants didn't they wanted to drink and the response from those middle class reformers was to say actually you know what the problem isn't alcohol it's the fucking catholics it's these fucking immigrants they're not they're not acting like we said they should well they can't act the way they should should you act the way you are because you were cradled in the bosom of the Lincolnite uh freeholder America, you got in, you were there, they can't act like you, but then instead of recognizing that, because recognizing that we recognize the inherent contradictions within the system that you're supporting, you have to find a solution that only exacerbates the problem, and the thing that hampered all levels of reform everywhere, anti-monopoly. uh soft money, temperance, all of which had virtue within them, even the temperance movement was a genuine attempt to reduce things like domestic violence, at every level, they were undermined by uh the fact that there were there was some segment of the population that was uh opposed for one reason or another to that reform, and that would cause the reformers, committed as they were to the system as such, to... to condemn them as demographically and divide within, and that has been, that's been the story of America more than anything is that our our polyglot nature has meant that at every crucial moment of conflict, there has been more that breaks up the labor half, the labor side of of the equation, then brings them together. and now and what is all this for? what is all this to defend? what are all these reform uh pretzels? what is Andrew carnegy going oh we're going to buy we're going to give everybody libraries and they can go read and not and not be sorry we shot the hell out of all of uh your your family members and are making them work 12 hours a day but here go read a fucking book uh what um what is this system producing culturally it's producing mass entertainment and mass amusements that are horrifying the middle classes, but are the only thing available to poor people, I mean they literally want these people to have middle class tastes when they are don't have the money of the middle class, they think that middle class means something. other than at that point, other than fucking income in a social relationship, they think that it's it's a state of mind that they need to impart, and if you can't take it then you need to be kicked out of the country, basically um, so it creates a culture that they hate, even though it's being generated by the logic of capitalism that they endorse, uh, it's creating alcoholism, it's making people smaller and more sickly, and what is it making? economically, and I want to talk about, I want to read a little bit and talk a bit about what I was saying, my favorite part of the book so far, White's description of the political economy of the cattle drive, I'm going to read a a section here that will be relatively long, but I think it's perfect, because it describes so the description of the economy of of cattle investments. in the old west uh and the cattle drives from Texas into into to the to the rail hubs um is essentially the same model that you find at every juncture of uh finance capital and the physical economy in America or any kind of economy in American history. Let me see if I can find it here, so let me just start by saying uh, the whole reason that the cattle drive happened, all those spheres going up through to Aboline was because Texas Longhorn cattle carried a tick that made them uh dangerous to be around other types of animal because they had a uh a fever that from the tick. that they mostly became immune to as as uh caves, but which if the tick got to a different cow that hadn't had that would make the the cow sick, perhaps kill it, so longhorns could not be brought to local rail hubs and shipped with other cattle, like domestic breeds that people brought to Texas, they couldn't uh take them to local railheads because they were not allowed with the other cows, so they would have to go basically around. to isolated uh railheads that we're sitting there doing nothing because one of the marks of the railroad the railroad investment of the post of a warrera is that a lot of it went towards building railroads that never saw much action and never got much uh traffic because they were all speculative white points out the railroads went first in most of the west it was not people showed up uh as uh settlers of oh here's the railroad the railroad went first railroad and the army went first and then people followed, now in a lot of places they didn't fall, they didn't, not many, not very many of them followed because oh we can't actually grow anything here, so you had a lot of just fucking oh rail uh heads just sitting empty, and so that's a place you could take a shit ton of diseased longhorns to take to the the east, and so they drove these fuckers uh up into the uh, into Kansas and and even into the Dacotas. uh and the thing that funded them, this was like the people who were, this was the single most sort of rationalized, financialized and and industrial elements of the western economy, which is what makes it so ironic that the cowboy mythos goes around it, cowboys were not sadbusters, cowboys were not independent uh uh settlers out on the planes huddling in their cabin. against Indian attack, they were employees, they were workers, they were hired by big firms to poove those fucking cattle, so uh, and of course the irony of ironies is that they had to kill all the buffaloes to fill this area with these fucking cows, which many of them were uh miserable mistreated. did starved in places that the buffalos had drived for millennia uh because because they were domesticated and you could move them and you could ship them and you could turn it into profit, you don't have to go up to one buffalo shoot it and eat it for a year. Texas, I'm going to read this here, Texas cattle gave and this is page 595, if anyone wants to follow along. Texas cattle gave an initial boost of to beef consumption, beef from longhorns was tough. turism pretty much summed up by the title of General James S Brisbin's beef bananza or how to get rich on the planes great name for a book by the way in the late 1870s and the early 1880s cattle raising spread steadily north I have to say he should have just stuck with um he should just stuck with beef bananas you don't need the ore there beef bananas is so much fun uh Okay, by the 1880s, cattle companies and corporations created by eastern and British investors dominated the western ranges. Uh, and then he talks a little bit about how uh, Teddy Roosevelt went out east, or went out to the Dakota's to play Cowboy, and it was all made up. Uh, British and Scottish investors alone pumped $34 million worth of capital, declared book value into the Western Livestock industry in the United States during the last quarter of the 19th century. what attracted investors was an industry heavily subsidized by the federal government, a set of economic calculations too good to be true, and promises made by promoters that amounted to little more than a modern ponzi scheme. John clay was a scotsmaned much of his adult life in the cat and spent much of his adult life in the cattle business. it was, clay remembered a crew business at the beginning, and it remained saw until the end. the subsidies, as with the railroads were enormous. the federal government had opened up the public domain by evicting Indians, whom rosevelt despised and whoose. removal he saw is both inevitable and commendable uh the federal government provided Rosevelt and other cattlemen with free land and nature provided the grass and water that the cattle consumed. the federal government and states subsidized the railroads that promoted cattle raising and hold cattle the market. for all practical purposes, the producer in this industry was the product itself. for cows and sears got precious little help from humans in surviving on the great planes. their owners branded them, rathered them with when ready for shipping and sent them off to market. a fairly simple set of calculations made profits seem inevitable. Cattleman calculated the price of maintaining a steer at between 75 cents and $25 a year. When stockman reported they could sell a four year old Waioming Steer for between $25 and $45 with costs exclusive of capital and transportation being between three and $6 a steer, how could they lose? If corporate reports were to be believed, always a dangerous thing to do in the Gilded age. Invest and not, I'd say also now, hashtag elon musk, hashtag. how is that fucking company still around, hashtag, how do you not think that this is a gigantic bubble that is going to collapse on all of us? Tesla is one of the biggest, it's like enron on freaking crack folks, okay? anyway, investors were not losing. Anglo-American cattle corporations produced dividends of 15 to 30% between 1881 and 1883, the dividends, as it turned out, actually came from new investments and loans, not profit from cattle. the corporations actually had little idea how many head they own, because actual cattle are hard to find during roundups, so to estimate their herds, cattle companies created a book count. bookcount cattle existed only in the ledger, in an age that was perfecting actuarial tables and life insurance policies, there was nothing remarkable about making educated guesses based on the average survival and reproduction of large numbers of cattle, but men seeking investors do not make good actuaries. in the book counts, the west was a land of perpetual spring and toothless wolves, real cattle died, had accidents and failed the cave. book cattle, bookcount cattle reproduced a dependable annual rate, usually 70%. bookcount caves matured and begat more bookcount caves. Western cattle corporations borrowed on their bookcount cattle, which were immune to the vagaries of western life. As a shayan saloon keeper, told a group of disconsol cattleman drinking at his bar while a blizzard raged outside. Cheer up boys, whatever happens, the books won't freeze. Now of course that whole thing eventually collapsed, but it was uh, everybody was. out, you either lost, or if you knew the right people, you got bailed out, and that for that right there, that model, that is the model of the American economy since uh, essentially it's inception, but certainly since the civil war, and it's the same thing as the railroads, the railroads operated on the exact same way, the railroads thrived on continued investment and gave people, gave uh investors dividends to induce further investment, those dividends not coming from the profits from often unprofitable railroans that have been speculatively laid out, for free because the government just gave them fucking money and capital to do it, uh, but from more loans and investors. how much, how much, how much freight are you actually moving? how many, how many uh people are paying you to fucking travel on your rails or how how much uh weed is going on it? that doesn't matter. look at these returns. how many cattle are you actually moving to fucking abolied? it doesn't matter, we have them right here. and what and all of these have in common is that you have a... things that are common necessities like transportation infrastructure like agricultural production that are uh established through direct. government intervention, clearing the land, providing in a real sense the capital, and then private actors, whose proximity to the plate to the interaction to the transaction is luck in the sense that it is personal relationships, it's not fucking wisdom and vision and genius, are then able to essentially act as as as ticks. uh creating fake propaganda and uh and fraudulent book uh keeping to keep a flow of investor money in as long as they can, paying themselves as much as possible until the thing falls apart, that's the fucking cousing crisis, that's netflix, netflix's numbers, oh 70 million people watch the king's gambit, that's is just that's like the fucking cattle, that's exactly like oh i've got 500 head of cattle headed to abellen. look at this, look at these notes, look at the ledger, so so social forces produce uh industries and then are then and then the uh, the the product of them is is kept and privatized, because at the end of the day they don't trust us with it. and nor should they, and of course they say, the reason you can't trust people with it is because there are a bunch of uncultured swine who will spend it all on boos, some of them are, but the one thing that is definitely sure is that if there is uh worker control of their actual like the capital they work with as opposed to just uh a wage, the the super fluidity of the capitalist because very very quickly and very readily apparent and that is the last thing any of these people want and one of the signs that um the working class uprisings that you saw with 70s uh the 77 strikes with the hey market and the eight hour day movement and homestead were uh being met with enough brutality enough unified violence and enough resistance at the highest levels of both parties, because as much as you have this efflorescence of anti-monopolis and both parties and he talks about the budding populist party emerging out of Kansas and moving through the country and and challenging republicans and democrats in the north and south. um, by the late 1880s, the demands of labor symbol. by the American Federation of labor and Samuel Gompers, emerged as sort of an umbrella organization of of the emerging labor unions, moved away from demands for control of workplaces and towards wages, towards consumption. Okay, we cannot be owners of the means of production, because you will kill us if we try to do that, and we're too, we're too, um, we're not unified enough to fight you and win, but we can do is especially since it's good for the damn economy, is get more of the surplus in the... form of wages which we can then spend at our discretion, we can become consumers, and that's what they became, that's what they are now, that is why so much of the hair splitting about who counts as working class is incredibly tedioous and pointless, and honestly i think it's mostly about people uh just looking to sanctify themselves morally, like i think a lot of people who who go to college to learn about things like class oppression filter a lot of the stuff through a middle class morality and they here working class and they'... think good and they think anything else is, oh those are the bad exploiters, and so you have all these people insisting, i'm working class, like well, maybe, maybe in terms of your your relationship to means of production, but the reason that that was supposed to matter in the marxist conception is that people in those relationships generated social relationships with each other and generated class consciousness out of that, we are in a situation where we have 100, 330 million consumers, there's nobody has a class character. and so seeing people argue about it is very baffling unless you realize oh they're just trying to have someone validate that they're good people yeah i saw that hispanics and and uh young people believe in Q and on the most and of course they do because they have they have not invested in any of the bullshit that we tell ourselves about this country, what i mean by that is, i mean like that these institutions have like a a sacredness to the in themselves, like a lot of the q people they imagine that there is some america. some ideal America that they're representing, but the actual institutions of government and media uh to them are this disgusting corruption of that, and that is a reasonable thing to think, if you're just observing the world, you turn on the TV and there are all of the major tech companies and every awful giant corporation telling you that Donald Trump is a bad man and he has to be stopped and he's not American and stuff, oh and by the way, here's uh, you're not getting anything, uh, you're you are, you are. left to the devices of the market, good luck in the middle of a pandemic, there's nothing for you, but you're supposed to care about this stuff, and you're supposed to be concerned about America's democracy, as though it has ever done anything for you, as though it has ever done anything for you, i think q and on started with boomers, you saw that in the early stuff, but it's a different thing now, i don't think it's the same thing, i think that those first generation of of of popularizers were facebook grandmas, but once it became viral, once it became just a shortcut for the system is filled with criminal lizard pedophiles, which is a sensational narrative hook for any young person who's disengaged from politics, but is aware that the world they live in is fucked. and also that it's a good way to get paid, like that's the other thing is that the the the original like q and on uh conceptions and and like the original uh proofing and stuff i think was done by a bunch of housebound old people, but once it hit tik tok, once it hit social like uh young people media, it could be something that could be turned into a a hustle and all of us are looking for a hustle every one of us because that's the only escape route if you unless you have the money, unless you are part of unless you're sitting on some of that fucking uh horded cash from the mid-century bonanza if you are even the ch like not and i'm not saying working class like maybe not a a a boat ownership dealer but the bone ownership dealer's like second son the boat ownership dealer second son especially since that boat ownership probably doesn't make as much money as it used to and it's probably got a bunch of fucking uh leveraging you're you're not getting anything nobody is getting anything and no jobs have any kind of promise of stability or or or certainly stability at all, let alone the kind of creative um satisfaction that the knowledge economy was supposed to provide to labor, for people who went to school and got and got and and learned, there's nothing, there's there's fucking uh, there's gig economy uh jerbal work, unless you can monetize your own self somehow like i have. I am, I am in a perfect example, and like the the the Bernie thing was essentially a cusc phenomenon in that sense, and that provided a common vocabulary for alienated people online to talk with, and then to talk to each other, and then to promote each other, and q is the same thing. I'm not ammer, this is my first beer. Let's see if there's anything else I wanted to talk about from this section. Uh, I did like the detail where he points out that when Teddy Rosevel went out to Dakota after his wife and his mom died on the same day in his house uh. that he bought a gold mounted bowy knife from Tiffany and company. Trump, tr really was a Trump type in that he was a tough guy who people thought was a tough guy, but was actually a fancy lad, but the difference between the late 19th century and the early 21st is the difference between having to actually do something to think of yourself as a tough guy and just tell selling telling everybody that you're a tough guy that does the work. Wiscons nights are built differently. Oh, I wanted to uh quote this little ditty that uh, nativists in Massachusetts said, the Irish and the Dutch, they don't amount to much, for the mix have their whiskey and the Germans guzzle the beer, and all we Americans wish they had never come here. I have to say, not very catchy, pretty bad. It's a reason that those people did not really make any culture. The middle class protestant. beef with the the catholic urban immigrants was that they didn't have culture, but they were the only ones culture, that American middle brow was nothing. uh, oh yes, I wanted to bring up uh, good old Frederick Taylor, the founder of Taylorism and scientific management of of uh of uh work movements, who brought mechanism, mechanization to the actual act of performing work, human mechanization, uh, people probably know a little bit about taylor, but I think what's most important interesting about him is that he was a laborer, he was a fourman basically, and he essentially made his own job, he created the idea of being a um of being a um mechanical engineer out of nothing, he just bullshitted it, and that's how when we talk about the formation of you know the bureaucratic class that interposes itself between you know the purely exploited worker and the and the capitalist. uh, a lot of them are, you know, these men of letters like uh, like how that uh white talks about, but some of them are eager working-class drivers who uh, just hustle their way to bluffing people into thinking that they have a certain um, a certain expertise, and as long as that expertise can be profitably sold to capital, it will have value, and no matter how spotty and non-existent the scientific basis for any of his theories was, he was able like Edison and other people, he was able to sell himself to capitalists because he was telling them something they wanted to hear, and here was a guy who had to get, he got to go from the the factory floor to a nice office because essentially he he made his own job with bullshit, and that was a big part of building that middlestrata. Okay uh, they talk a little bit about the, I want to talk a little bit about the Knights of labor uh, so the Nights of Labor were like the first, they were the before the AFL, they were the first attempt to create an umbrella organization for workers that would be able to coordinate across geography and across industries and they were not modeled on labor unions really, they were modeled on um originally the Knights of labor were model on uh the fraternal orders, like the... Masons and the odd fellows that were blowing up in America to fill in the gap of that social connection that you know they didn't have here and then a lot of them had had in Europe and the sons of the Knights of labor were were a explicitly working class uh fraternal order that over time was able to do things like collect money for strike funds and coordinate action and and move against workers and assert workers uh prerogatives but it was this jerry rigged system uh and it was it's apugy and then fall came at the same time which is that it precipitated the great uh 1885 railroad strikes and then it was uh once those were broken it sort of was on a slow decline and eventually was supplanted by the afl good old Samuels Samuels we love to hear about Samuel Gompers, one of those names I remember writing down in my book in like ninth grade history, there's I thought about this a while ago that there are certain things that I just get stuck in my head from learning American history, never and because you know you mostly you don't learn what's going on or why, you just learn discrete events that you're supposed to memorize, it's the worst way to teach the subject, and it's the reason most people hate history, and I don't think anybody in power is unhappy with that turn of events. but i remember Samuel's zimmerman telegram uh the a x y z affair wilmot provizo absolutely the gadston purchase it's another one teapot dome teapot dome is so funny teapot dome is hilarious the 1920s were incredibly important period in American history, I mean it set the stage for a catastrophic economic collapse, and then the the reforging of a new political economy out of the wreckage of it, it had the prohibition, it had the rise of gangsters, all this stuff, the only thing you learn about from the political strata of that era is the some fucking asshole siphoning some oil out of a hole in the ground, that's it, which in like the the paniply of of corruption, one of a very low peer thing, i mean like, i hate talking about like Trump as as you, some horrible crook cuz they're all croocks, but trump's personal corruption, dwarfs anything like that, and yet teapot d because you got to gotta talk about something right and you can't talk about any of the actual stuff going on like the fact that the clan took over half the country and ran like the state of Indiana for example seward's folly is a good one seward's fally is a good one the cross of gold speech william jedenks brian but if you're anything like me and you went to public school when you learned history was just a collection of these things that you just had to remember, why any of them happened, what any, what connection any of them had to each other, it was all vague to nonexistent, sinners in the hands of an angry god, absolutely, oh you got to talk about trying edwards, if you have a milkshake and i have a milkshake, and i have a long straw, here it is, i go across the room into your milkshake, uh I drink your milkshake, still my favorite scene in movie history. I drink it up, I drink the blood of lamb from Vandy's tracked. All right, I'm going to see if there's anything else I want to talk about here, uh, Yeah, that's pretty much it, so for the next next Wednesday we're going to finish it, next wednesday we're going to read part three, which is the last part, we're going to go through presumably the pullman strike, the second cleveland administration, uh, and the fact that Cleveland let another economic collapse happened and did nothing, the democrat broke the flowman strike and then refused to provide any uh aid to suffering people. because at that point, it's baffling, it's amazing, and it reminds you, it's not baffling really, it's just it shows how over time the party system exists essentially to mask the confluence of interest at the top of both parties, and they were divided sectionally for a good chunk of America's history, after the civil war, the divide was regional, it was not ideologic. the parties had basically the same structure in many ways, regardless of the fact they had different demographics of support, at the base you had a variety of people, including, i would say a by this period in time, i would say the the base of both parties is composed of people who are in favor of anti-monopoly action, soft money to increase the the the currency supply and and increase and help the position of debters uh, but at the top were hard money men, maybe the only real difference, the only, the only actual issue difference between the two, besides of course uh, the administration of voting in the south was um, was tarif, was the fucking tarif was industrial policy uh, but in both cases the preference for one of the... other was not driven from the bottom up, it was driven by the interest of the top, which at that time were still divergent because of the regional differences, because all that finance capital and specifically, all of that industrial capital that needed the tariff to maintain, to be to protect it from foreign uh competition was in north. I find that I'm always learning new stuff, like I obviously I'm fairly familiar with this period of time, but rereading reading this book, a lot of things pop up like because people are always going to find interesting and and fun uh and insightful trucks of positions that you wouldn't otherwise know even if you have a general understanding, also you get great names, like one in this section there's a discussion of a uh corrupt Indian agent, which is of course uh a redundancy named: Valentine Maggillacutty, wonderful 19th century now, and what's not and that reminds me of one more, the last thing I want to say about this section and the book and that era reminding me of the Indian agent thing, is the fee for service model of public uh administration, the thing about the United States at the civil war is that it had theoretically a vast amount of... power over the continent, a huge amount of land that theoretically dominance over, but its administrative capacity to carry out that authority was limited by its uh undeveloped infrastructure. over such a large sized country, and part of that was technological, we we just didn't have the ability to really coordinate, and so what filled the gap was self-interest in the form of fee-based services, if you were a cop, if you were a judge, if you were a uh indian agent, if you were, if you had any role within the government as a uh, as a regulator or or official, you were not necessarily paid a salary, so much as you were paid um... fees for the people who you work for, which of course that goes against the idea of a public service right, because uh, it should be provided for free, but that would not have allowed for the motivation factor, that wouldn't have not gotten people to do the work, you got a bunch of uh, you've got a bunch of people fleeing the authorities for example into Indian country from Missouri, like in uh true grit, nobody's going to go and get them unless they know it's going to be worth their while, so you got. have bounties, and that extend, that logic extended throughout all of the administration for everything uh, and that plus the spoil system was the basis for like the wildly corrupt nature of public administration, uh, but the thing about the spoil system, and as I pointed this out last week, which we were told if we learn at all about it in history as this was a corrupt uh, non-democratic structure and that civil service reform eventually like... uh cleaned it up uh in reality there the um the spoil system uh allowed the the parties to assert some independence from capital because they had independent funding sources because the deal with the spoil system was say you're like a bartender or wardhealer or popular guy in the neighborhood you get a bunch of people to vote for the democrat or the republican you're awarded with like a sanitation job or marshall or something like that, you if you get a salary or fees, you give a percentage of it to the party, so it's personally corrupt, like you'd have to give money to the guy, the your patron, but also it built the party capacities, because and that was necessary, because the stupid constitution, by assuming that parties couldn't exist, ended up creating a vacuum for administration of elections that ended up having to be filled by the political parties and meant that political parties ended up being... a a load-bearing member of a a loadbearing element of a structure that was designed not to include them at all wild and what of the consequences of getting rid of fee for service and specifically getting rid of the the spoils kickback system is that the parties became even more dependent on large money donations from capital because who the hell else has the money to give a fucking political party. All right, so let's see the last part for next week, oh yes, and also he talks, like I said last week, Henry George Rain from mayor of New York against Teddy Roosevelt, uh, and he talks about that in this section, and it was a three-way race between a liberal Democrat is running uh with Tamini support, even though he was not a Tamini man, uh, Teddy Roosevelt running as a republican but as a uh sort of quasi populist republican, and Henry George running on a labor ticket, and the and the working-class Irish who were the taminony base, they they liked what they heard from George. and the way that Tamani was able to win that election was by replacing the votes they lost to George with middle and middle class Republican votes because because they recognized the threat where they saw it, and that's the thing about Tamani and the urban machines is that yes they were more democratic than the bureaucratic state that would come later certainly, but they were still. uh at the they were still structures that served capital and that got a better deal for their uh constituents, their clients than you know the raw market would have, but that when push came to shove would coordinate with capital to prevent a real challenge to emerge to its proogatives, so they impeached him, huh? John Moricy, yeah, I uh, I did a a doll up episode, I guess not doll up episode about John Moricy, fight. build a butcher, it's pretty fun, third party win, yeah, that's a good question, i don't know, i mean honestly might not even be a party, we might be beyond that by the time it gets organized, but uh, depending on the whatever, i don't know, i don't know man, but it's it's at some point presumably there would be a party expression of of challenge to this this dead conflict between neoliberal. inclusive capitalism and white nationalist this petty bouge temper, because they will only reinforce each other, and that to me more than anything is why I have no obligation to to supply any kind of rhetorical support for a campaign to raise the alarm and to demand uh a a a defensive line supporting every hysterical argument about from democrats because none of it is going to go, you're saying, well we got to do it, we have to fend off the fascist threat, when will that ever happen, it'll never go away, the fucking republican base isn't going to change their mind, they're always going to be there, and the only response for the democrats will be hysterical clapping and punitive police state measures, because they sure shit have no interest in draaming the swamp by making life in this country any less miserable for anybody who lives in it, biden today says, we're not going to do a big uh, we're not going to do a big reconciliation stimulus, we're going to go through the regular channels and work with the republicans, and maybe in the end they won't do that, but it's the same scam, it's the exact same scam, these guys are a threat to democracy, these guys are existential enemies of the republic, also though, they are the ones who get to dictate domestic policy, and you will have to support that even as it makes everything worse, even as it creates more. Yahoos, more people willing to commit violence on behalf of their fucking orange god emperor, more people uh, violently alienated from society, willing to carry, I mean, it's not, people are worried about queue and on violence, and that's going to be a thing, sarcastic political violence is going to be just a feature of politics, but as I said, crime in general is up and going to keep going up, because this shit is falling apart, the social coherence is collapsing to the degree there ever was any buse it was all held together by plenty, it was all held together by... the promise of more, that's what kept people together, even though we never melded into an actual uh, national identity, and the answer to all these is going to, the only answer that liberalism can give is suppression, just like those, it's it's the exact same thing as those reformist evangelicals trying to break up the Indian reservations into allotments, it's like we're we're caught in this death spiral, global capital is un unleashed uh, the only place for profit is at the expensive labor, every job has to be uh proletarianized, every person has to be proletarianized if they don't have access to enough capital, and um, you can either learn to code uh, or beh, or just if you can't, then you just have to take it, you have to take it and remember that this is a good country, and there's a lot of shows on Netflix you can watch, and that's only 10 bucks a month, that those are your choices. and if you don't like it, the answer is going to be the fucking stick, and there's going to be a lot of leftists, a lot of leftists, whatever that fucking means, we are going to be cheering along the entire time, because we have to stand strong together, even though it will be the policy of this fucking party, these democrats in power that will make everything that these people are terrified of worse. I will never be held accountable, how dare you even suggest, how dare you even suggest that I will be held accountable, I mean these people are, how is it like the thing I was supposed to have been councelled for what i said that the fucking capital is not some sacred institution, it's a goddamn uh, it's a it's baffamet uh ritual alter place, um, that's bad because it like lets them off the hook for the riot, how how at this moment in time with these democratic institutions showing themselves every day to be frauds, showing us every day that yeah in a class society. democracy is impossible, there is no such thing as democracy in a class society, because one class has the fucking power, and they're going to exercise it, and your ability to to influence them, well... always be channeled and uh and reduced and dissipated and you might get, you might get a little more pie now, but eventually you will be put through the fucking shoots into the goddamn slaughter house, if that's what the ledger says to do, and in this moment we're supposed to be resanctiftifying this holo ritual with meaning that it does not deserve, who does that benefit? sure shit doesn't benefit anybody but the people in the political class who are trying to keep this fucking shared going as long as they can, like the democrats think that they have the whip hand now at least in terms of public opinion, they think that those they think and this is the important thing, they have no way of knowing because they're caught in the fucking bubble just like everybody is, like they can make fun of que people for being delusional, but i'm sorry if you're a democrat, you're as delusional, you live as much in a filtered reality that does not tell you anything. thing about the average sentiment or um like will to act in any way of the mass of the American people, and so I watch that debate and everyone's saying america, the American people are horrified and they want, you hope that's true, how do you know though, you're just going to bluff it and hope that enough winging the alarm and waving the bloody shirt will discipline these people, but they're... the thing is uh, all they want to do, all they want to do that with, all they want to do with that whip hand, it's not push policies, it's not, oh here we got them on the ropes, we're actually going to institute medicare for all, no, it's we got him on the ropes, we're going to reaffirm uh the America's trust in our sacred democratic institutions and then launch like a uh domestic drone program combat combat terrorism. I think you're ignoring the fact that some lawers were explicitly targeted and probably would have been executed if the bob was more lucky. This isn't funny. I mean it's funny. I'm sorry, all of this is funny. 'if you don't think it's funny, then log, then you should not be on the internet, my god uh, but like was it terrifying for the people in it, yes, what's really weird to me is people who insist that like i haveen, i have i have we all have some sort of um duty to affirm like the lived experience and emotional response of members of congress, like their posters, like their other posters, there other like online friends of ours who are trying to validate, they're members of congress, they have more common with each other, they have more in common with Kevin Mcarthy and they do with us, the queue people as the new anti-masonic party, that's a good, that's not a bad comparison actually, because animasonic party was a similar impulse, it was people looking around at the at the at the bounty of of uh of the American of the virgin america finding uh broad blocks to the advancement that they thought that they would have in it and decided that it's it's that that couldn't be in this land of plenty that that couldn't be in America with its constitution and its and its founding heroes, it must be in this secret bunch of uh people hanging around and wearing aprons and who knows what in their secret societies, they even had like a uh their own um like Epsteen case the... own sort of whoa, or I guess Seth Rich would be a better, and that there was a murder, there was a famous murder of a former mason who was threatening to publish a book, exposing masonic secrets in Northern New York, which helped spark the anti-masonic party coming into being, and the animasonic party was part of that uh, drive towards, it was, it was a middle class movement, much like the know nothing's ended up being, in in the upper upper north of the country of the... It's uh of the northern tier uh, it started in upstate New York, but uh, I believe there were eventually anti-masonic congressmen elected in Maryland, uh, so like up through the through the Mid Atlantic region uh, but not the deep south uh, and it looked at horror at the Jacksonian democracy and the slave power that uh, that dictated it. but could not find any uh, could not put any faith in the wigs as an opposition to it, because they was filled with masons and queuenon is a similar thing, when you're just trying to make sense of this world and you're looking for bad guys. they're everywhere in both parties. now it takes a certain sort of American brain poisoning and uh essentially mental like suffocation to decide that Donald Trump is the person who's going to defeat them, but by the same token, why wouldn't it be? like the idea of a uh of of a lone hero stalking the halls of injustice is is an American archetype and it's built into the way we think of the presidency, like you can go, why do these people believe in Donald Trump, and of course he's donald fucking Trump, but he's also the president, and we have decided that the president, embodies something as opposed to just essentially being a vessel for interests far beyond his personal ones and that their their adherence to the job is predicated on the understanding that they will carry out those will, that will, and that their like self-actualization of will to power is more - matter of embodying the moment and embodying the interests and powers and uh constituencies of the moment, than of shaping anything, but that's certainly not how we think of them, like how could we put that much emotion behind it? how could we invest so much of our sense of ourselves as democratic participants in it if that's all the presidenty was. the presidency has to be some guy with a fucking anime sword who can cut through the gordian not of injustice. if he's not, why do we care so much? Oh shit, it's pretty late, damn i went, I went long. All right, uh, well, we'll see what happens next, won't we? Next week, for example, we'll have all this, and uh, also, by the way, 20,000 troops in the capital, so I, my prediction is still solid that it will be a orderly if tense transition of power uh, and then you're going to start seeing some people pop off and then you're going to start seeing the the fist of the state come to smack Whitey in the face and tell him, no, no, no, you thought it was one way, but it's the other way.
