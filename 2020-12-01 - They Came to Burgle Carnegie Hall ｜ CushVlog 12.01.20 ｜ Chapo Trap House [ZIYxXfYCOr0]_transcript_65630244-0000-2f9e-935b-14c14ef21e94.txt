 There we go, it's going, or is that, oh shit, it's hosting a song, oh it's not hosting asan, sorry guys, sorry for any of the teens an, any of the young zomer child soldiers who are enjoying hasan on our. speed, it's me, now Hasan's uh, Hasan's weird uncle, I guess, that's me, there will be no sound complaints today, I've got my thing on there, and I've made peace with everything else, finally getting chily out, and that's going to. be a storm this weekend, apparently, storms are coming, ah, oh, bodegas, boys, girls, gather around, let me tell you about bodegas, there's just magical places where you can go at any time of night to acquire goods. food stuffs, basic household necessities, i know, i know those of you who live anywhere near a 24-hour CDs might be a gog it is, but yeah it's true uh yes every this we were talking yesterday about how there's these cycles, these these these discourse cycles that reemerge, we got to drag the clap, another one just happened too, just the clas like I was talking about David Foster Wales, the classics in general now being dragged by a bunch of... Ya people, I always find that funny because it's called young adult, but none of the people involved in any of it, writing it, reading it or talking about it are young or adult, they are old babies, they're old children, they are like 30 plus emotionally stunted uh uh, emotion uh intellectually uh nomish kid, I mean they're just they're immature and why they read and write stuff for kids exclusively because they are emotionally intellectually children. i don't only know why that should be considered um elitist or hostel or anything, it just seems like a recognition of of of the dynamic to play there. anyway, so you got dragging the classics for being having not enough wizards in them, you got David Foster Wales being dude bro. Steely Dan and then of course another one popped up New York and it's in it's uh it's justus tilly like disdain for the rest of the country uh and I get it I get it on all sides. I certainly understand the hostility in york uh especially because honestly I think more than anything it stems from the fact that United States is a country where you are only worthwhile to the... that you are a success, right? and because of its position in global finance and media, New York is where successful people go, so if you're not there, how successful can you really be? I don't think that necessarily everyone thinks that, but I do think that it's a thing that motivates this sort of weird hostility, but of course the other thing is the genuine overcompensating parolism of New York, mostly by transplants who are trying to justify the fact that they're spending a zillion dollars to live like animals with basically no real difference in quality of life to any other major city other than it being worse and specifically during coronavirus, during covid, a time when any city, certainly New York is a ridiculous joke to be living in, because you're just cooped up for no reason, it has no benefits to it, but it still costs the same, it's chumpish, you're chump, and so you have to do things like decide. that the bodenga experience is some sort of spiritual thing. the one of my favorite moments in recent film was in the Harley Quinn movie, when there is a five-minute sequence of someone lovingly creating a bacon uh or um an egg sandwich at a bodenga, because Harley Quinn, she loves her sandwich at her favorite bodenga, and you watch that scene and oh, this is meant specifically for the very narrow trance of people who... watch this shit online or who like who will live within this bubble of media people who will talk about their who justify to themselves their ridiculously expensive existences so it's just just uh it's self-loathing reaching across the isle which is all like i've said that's all culture and politics same thing or it's it's uh competing it's resent it's mirroring resentments pure resentment on both sides new yorkers resenting that they live in a in a shit hole that's supposed to be the center of the world and everyone outside of it who doesn't live there resending that either they're not there at some level if they've really bought in. the notion of you know virtue is flowing from success or uh it's undeservingness as as the place that determines these things as as the as the defining reference point for success or glamor or money or anything power uh and so that's what you're always end up seeing with these things is one concentration of resentment verballs forest, like that person who did the viral tweet about what are you people, what do you people call it where you can get all these things at uh 1 in the morning uh, she lives in New York under a pandemic, it's a misery, but there's the badenga, which you yolles don't have, or if you do, it's not the same, that's just my resentment of people living somewhere else, and then then it hit the resentment of people who are sick of New York for one reason or another and the resent it's status uh one way or the other they think it's undeserved or they think it's deserved and then it's just a reflected self-loathing for not having attained it and then they get to fight each other over it, it's great, it's a lot of fun, we're all having fun, we're all having a lot of fun and that's the important thing uh so yes, it's nice to see that all the cycles are completing themselves, everything is continuing to go, but nothing is ever learned, nothing is ever changed, the cast of character shifts a little bit, but largely through just people washing out of the cycle, not really realize, not transcending it. Why do I call it a bodenga? That's because Felix who is very resentful New Yorker, not not, he is like got both cuuse he hates and resents New York like someone's not from there, but he also lives here, so he has both sets of resentments in one, which is tough, and so he hates Bodega culture more than anyone and and he makes fun of it by calling. Felix is a walking contradiction, it's true, partly true, partly fiction. everything is a paradox, ain't that the truth? everything is a bundle of contradictions that must be resolved. oh, i got a new one today, i got a poland spring, i thought i'd try this pomegranate lemonade. not bad, i'll probably stick with black cherry, but as a as a change of pace, not bad. No, I had, this is the this is from the fridge, it's nice to call, I'm not, I don't think we're going to do a series on around contra specifically, I mean we'll probably talk about it a lot when we talk about when we do uh episode two of the Bush episode uh or um episode two of the Bush series. because uh the same way that Nixon was the white the executive uh branch uh point man like the white house pointman for um the bay of pigs george HW Bush had the same role uh with her on contrandra him and Oliver north were the ones running it uh and so we'll talk a lot about his involvement in it in being a fucking mega kilo drug trafficker. while telling people that winners don't use drugs, while having the dea entrap a 17-year-old kid into selling them some crack outside of the white house so that he could hold it up in front of the camera. and then the kid gets 10 years, one of the most despicable little moments of the Bush administration, this motherfucker, this is not a joke, in order to ramp up the war on drugs and increase uh the carcerial state, he wanted to have a uh a speech where he laid out the case for more punitive uh approach to drugs, and what he wanted to do is he wanted to hold up some crack that had been purchased within sight of the white house or something to prove how pervasive the problem was, only problem was for. them white house that there was nobody who really sold there, there were not open air drug markets within side of the white house even then even in the high crime early late 80s, so what the DA did is they they they got a they got a uh in touch with a dealer uh in anacostia i think and they had him come to like the the uh the reflecting pool or something and then arrested him and then he did 10 years on that shit. and and Bush got to hold up that crack in front of the camera and throw more people like that kid in prison, well, moving that shit into the country to be sold in the first place, I mean it's it's founding, and his we'll talk a lot about his role in a rank contra, the bron contra more broadly, and although you know I think for the most part we're it's, I think we'll stick to broad strokes, I mean, but his specific involvement and the specifics of the drug operation I think are going to be very very uh well investigated so we will be talking about in the next bush episode I don't know when Bush Car to is going to come out my guess is that we'll record it sometime next month to release because it's doesn't have a it's not topical so I think we might we might do it early to bank for the holiday season, although who the fuck knows if there's even really going to be a holiday season this year, it does seem like everything is in this weird perpetual state even now of of stasis. I hate to show you guys my hairline there, I know it's pretty dramatic, I should put a uh, I put a trigger warning on, so uh, I wanted to say something about JD Vans, uh, and not, not him specifically, but sort of him as as an example of sort of... the the the new man that we've created in America, and not just a man or even exclusively a man, but in the sense that the Soviets were trying to build a new man, a new socialist man who who would transcend the the the restrictions of what we in bourgeois society uh convince ourselves as human nature, and this is like that is the that is the the metaphysical uh battle within or uh that is the metaphysical uh alchemy that communism seeks. to uh engage and I think that that they weren't wrong to imagine things that way, I mean they were wrong to think that they could happen within uh a anything other than a global context uh and I think the fact that when the Soviet Union collapsed it collapsed into uh rapine and and uh cliptocracy proves that they didn't create a new man uh but they did recognize that the new man needed to be built in order to live communally uh to be broke to to to find value uh in unalienated labor of not expecting the the the fruits of one's production to be the consumption of it directly, but rather the the uh enjoyment of a social existence that uh what allowed them to freely express their their uh creative drive, their animal spirits without having it stripped away and then regiven to them in in a reduced form in the form of of a way. and and a consumption uh uh and access to a consumption economy, well they didn't do that, but meanwhile it was happening in the free world and in Russia too, and and eventually all barriers being broken was the creation of a new capitalist man, even out of the the uh the clay of modern man, like... 19th century man which was already uh being uh warped and buckled by the the hyper speed of capitalist social change uh but what... the last 40 years specifically have done has created a new capitalist subject, a true homo economicus, the people that they made up in those textbooks, the people the com, the evil mirror image of the the imagined transformed human of communism, the the antichrist version, and that being is one who sees all relation relationships as transactional, who defines all things uh as to have a market value, and that's not, that's not something that is traditionally think away people have believed, because we live socially, we have lived socially, and that existence of social bonds by definition, means uh non marketized bonds. because you can't put a price on that shit, like there's a reason that you can't go to the pawn shop and get the sentimental value on your items, because it only means something to you, well that idea, that idea that there is a value, an emotional value, a bond to anything or anyone that can transcend the market, which has been you know part and parcel to social existence for the entirety of humankind, had we are now in the process of replacing with a fully transactional human being who has no connections to anything that cannot be quantified in if not in dollars in a crude calculus of uh advancements personal advancements uh versus personal uh demerit like what everyone we know and everything that is in the world world is to be used to our advantage or to be ignored to prevent disadvantage, and we build around that the words like love and hate and the economy and politics and good and bad, but but at base what had been a social relationship with a transcendent definition to the person it to a fully. changeable uh value and obviously it's not happening, it hasn't happened fully, we still have the remnant feeling that we should have uh that there is something other than our benefit or a dollar amount or to a person or an item, and we are getting there because our time is being abstracted away from us, first it happened geographically, but now thanks to the internet, first first television and now the internet, we are stripping from the days of our lives, the chance to even have an emotionally frated engagement with another person by replacing time with people with time with screens, broadly understood, and what that has created, along with, that's just the technological part of it, the broader part of it is creating a culture whereby precarity is so uh deeply felt and uh the safety net uh non-marketized social interactions are so few and far between. that we essentially can't afford to do anything other than assigned value to our relationships if we want to get ahead, so those things combined are creating a new man, it's creating a a a capitalist new man, and JD Vance is par exence, one of those, another one, and I want to, I want to draw this contrast to talk about how in many ways these two people who seem separate and seem very different and to come from different backgrounds or in, i think, and obviously, you know, i'm i'm speculating on a hypothesis here, and this will all like end up looking like character assassination, but you know, if i'm wrong, i'll apologize, uh, but i'm just talking about like looking from the outside at the contours of their careers and lives and writing, uh, is uh, giatolentino, i feel like they are both perfect exemplars of this new type a person, and like I said, this person, it's no one's fault that they turn into this, it's how you end up responding to a a life and a body that you did not choose. and we can only we can never really judge anybody, the decisions they make, so there's a only so much that you can blame anyone for anything, but I do feel like like gio tolentino and and Jay Vance were both Americans who came into a world where there was a value system and there is a yard stick for human happiness and they had an ability to navigate it, from a young age they knew they did, they went to school and they found out that unlike some of their other peers that they pay attention and give back what the teacher had given them, and they had an awareness that doing that would lead them towards what was broadly understood throughout the entire culture, including everything their parents ever told them, or the world around them told them would be the good, good. a a goodness that you have to have to build any greater goodness on top of. the first slab of the fucking maslow's hierarchy. and they uh went through the ideological sorting mechanism that constitutes applying through the to the applying your mind to the educational system that we have and came out of it. going to college and going there and experiencing the full measure of uh the rule book for success in life uh, which by that point they wouldn't have gotten there if they hadn't made this decision, far back along the way of moving along this trajectory, they decided that they needed, even if they didn't want to, they needed to treat everyone as fungable and every relationship is buble if they were going to succeed, and the difference between them, the the difference in the reason, the reason that one of them came out and became a uh journalist, a left-wing writer and memoarist, and the other uh became a republican hedge fund guy and like quasi political operative uh is that one of them grew up a of course not the only reason but like the structure that made all of these subsequent reasons happen in the first place is that she grew up in uh as the child of wealthy immigrants uh who were actual no joke human traffickers in that they were they operated a business that had philippine uh those who wanted to teach in the United States uh would help them in the process of gaining the paperwork to do so and then moving them through and it was uh a it was like a more high class politer version of the coyote system that gets uh immigrants across the or uh immigrants or immigrants or migrants sorry migrants across the Mexican border uh involved confiscation of passports and and treatment in in baracks like housing and accommodations and it afforded her very very very successful life, very wealthy, but she was also a a uh a female which rendered her subject to like a patriarchy as she discovered in her in her the political awakening that comes with acquiring an understanding through the the cultural through the educational uh uh mental structuring that tells you you know who's responsible. for all the bad things, well she's a female, and the other is she is non-white, she's she's Asian and the the child of immigrants, who are of course, besides uh, black Americans, sort of the most stigmatized minorities are racialized uh, racialized immigrants because of their tenuous status here in America, legal and social, and so... in making her career as a uh writer, she mind that childhood, those experiences to create a narrative whereby her parents were these eager strivers who had to negotiate the maras of American racism in order to succeed, and that gave her ideas about how racism, ethnic uh and uh hostility to immigration and this country or contributing to to uh human misery like the human misery she knows her parents were involved in although she never said that in her memoir uh and that turns her into a liberal democrat. now JD Vance is a white boy uh, a and a poor white boy that or at least poorer than uh than our stereotype of a of a of a white male childhood in this country, the lower half uh. and as he acclimatizes through the educational system and finds out what's going on, where the bad things are, he gets, he why uh, why things are the way they are, who's responsible for what? you know, forming the runaments of a political consciousness, he finds out that there is an explanation for why things are bad, and the bad guys are white guys like him, they are white guys by definition, they are either rich white guys responsible for economic oppression, or poor white guys responsible for racism. and racial oppression, well what good does that do you if you're a young striver looking to get ahead? you gna apologize for yourself all day, why would i want to do that? fuck that. instead, what he did is he mined his family background to show how his uh, how he was able to overcome like the tainted association, and in so doing explain to a audiences of uh educated, wealthy liberals and conservatives who are trying to understand their fellowss and much like their reiltino to try to understand the exotic uh immigrant experience, this exotic uh lower class white experience, jd gets to treat his family as marionets to prove a point to them about how their failings are personal and his success by definition is also personal, that he is virtuous, and but that that that argument, which personalizes blame, it doesn't have as easy a uh adherence to the liberal, the more sophisticated, fully articulated, liberal collegiate description of oppression in this country, uh, but an enough for him to uh, so that makes him a a a a republican, so and uh, and a bootstraps guy, but both of them are people whose fundamental uh, everything they say and have done in their careers has been driven by a fundamental uh transactional relationship with all around them, where you turn your family uh into justgrist. and the problem we have now is that everybody who emerges from these structures, everybody who, everybody who is able to get a voice to be able to be heard, because the thing about America is is that the the the most oppressed among us are silent, spievoch, we can ac answer the question, does the suboltern speak? i don't know, but the suboltern does not tweet, not in a way that enters what we consider the political consciousness, it's all filtered through uh spokes people and media figures uh who, many of whom are able to act as gatekeers between the two two halves, the the the college educated, politically engaged half and those overwhelmingly among the poorest of us uh who are not part of the... this conversation, I mean they're tweeting right, but they're tweeting about their own shit, they're not part of the political discussion, they're not part of the discourse, unless it's filtered, unless it's been like colladed and translated, because of the the failure for people to be able to imagine outside their own their own bubble. It means that there's a self-consciousness that permeates all attempts to engage and renders them uh impossible. And yeah, they've never been part of the conversation, but and really all we're seeing now is just how how stark that is, because we have this social media that's hypothetically supposed to connect all of us and yet it reproduces the same uh hierarchies of structures as as our society itself, because if you're really struggling in this country. uh, you just do not have the luxury, not going to say privilege buse that's bullshit, but the luxury of engaging with politics as a meaning. category of life, because why would you waste your time? because it doesn't do anything. your lived experience tells you it doesn't do anything. the thing that tells us that it does something is books and tweets and tv shows and our friends and family and our parents, not our lived experience, just just a a translation of that, a baffling of that, a a mystification of that that we engage socially. Oh man, somebody, I mean, apparently they they're not going to do it now, but because people got mad, but the very fact that they try to me, it's another piece of the of the mosaic that you could just title rip subtect. there's you can't, you cannot do satire of this moment, so people don't know this story, in LA, union center, union station is the big train station in downtown, and it is also right now one of the main covid testing centers that they have, and a lot of covid testing spinners have been overwhelmed lately, as you could imagine, because covid is as bad as it's ever been in this country and getting worse by the day, and the LA the city government issued a permit for a uh gender swapped tik toc cast remake of can't buy me love to film there and close it to the public and close it close the the COVID testing site so not only are you having a situation where you're allowing the shooting of this thing to happen, 170 people running around this enclosed building at the height of the pandemic, they are, they are critically reducing the city's infrastructure for COVID response in doing so. now that does that tell you everything you need to know about the death spiral that capitalism is in this country because of it's complete control of government, like obviously government is the and and uh government is inextricable. from capitalism, but it serves, the reason it's there is it does serve a function of alienating some of the uh decision making away from self-interested individual capitalists so that you can coordinate and reduce, you can eliminate because capitalism is inherently wasteful and destructive, and at least reduce the fucking waste so that in times of crisis, for example, you can coordinate response. uh in such a way that prevents collapse, that's why after uh the there was a panic and economic, there was a ball street panic in 1907 that nearly brought the entire United States government or the United entire United States economy to collapse. the thing that stopped it is that JP Morgan locked a bunch of the biggest bank owners in in his library until they agreed to a private bail out of the American economy, of the of of the in the form of bailing out these the stock market. and that was such that was such a close call and totally dependent on one guy essentially having the were with individually to alienate himself from the mere logic of of short-term profit that he could override that and everyone else. you can't guarantee that's going to happen every time. so they created the federal reserve to do that at that level, and uh, similarly, and and what we have now is a situation where i all the things that were built up since the federal reserve systems, specifically after the new deal, to steer the ship have been all torn away and stripped and sold for parts because the you got to get money somewhere, you got to replace that profit that keeps going down, because we're not doing anything anymore, we're we're circulating money around, us economy at this point is just purely about investing, it's about spinning water wheels for no reason, the reason that Uber... and all these other companies that have never made any money and in fact are so in the poll that even if they monopolized their respective markets, it would take decades to even come close to making up for the fucking profit that the money that's already been waste that's already been lost, the reason they're going to keep giving them money, it's not necessarily they don't recognize that it's it's it's good money after bad, it's that there's nowhere else to put it, there's nowhere else to invest money other than in uh like recreating 19th century uh uh and current Indian practices of personal like servant servitude, all of the Uber shit is just creating through the bilateral contractual technological relations. relationship of a contractor and and a contract e uh old feudal old feudal servant bonds, that's the techno feutilism we keep talking about, and part of that means is that the government is completely control, completely controlled, so that they can't even recognize any more than the capitalist can, the individual capitalist can that in the even just for their own good they need to fucking pull up the goddamn nose of the fucking... plaine, hey, yes, we got a day, we got uh, we got this shot for uh, she's all that genderswap tik tok show, we got it, congratulations, that's going to net your company, what i bett a good uh 10 grand in uh, netflix royalties or whatever the fuck, meanwhile you have exacerbated the spread of a disease that is destroying an undermining the very fucking economy that this entire city is based on the movie theaters as we know them have closed and Yes, we already have streaming, but there's going to be a bottleneck there as you transition from one to the other, and a lot of money is going to get shed. You want if there's any hope of keeping that industry af float it is in tamping down on COVID as much as possible, and yet the short-term interest of some assholes who wanted to shoot a guy taking his glasses off and revealing that he's actually hot the whole time, and then they do a choreograph dance dance move to fat boy slim at the train station that is supposed to call. back to the choriance dance number uh from the end of the original she's all that and you have you got that congratulations and in exchange for that the you have further doomed everything unless the only reason this makes sense is if the idea of intervening in any of the bad stuff is a fiction and that the thing that separates those on the inside on the outside is not that they're just chain to the problem so much as they are chain to the profit motive and also cognicent that because they are chained to the the fucking mast, there's no stopping any of this, there's no controlling covid, therefore there are no more movie theaters, oh well, might as well get this fucking shot in, and that is what's going on, perhaps, perhaps perhaps, perhaps, like the thing that throws all of our models of self-interest, even short-term self-interest into a tizzy is the question of how self-consciously blackpilled are our elites, how much have they looked into the fucking uh anus of satan, how many of them have gotten their own personal Ned Baity speech, where the reality of it is capitalism and barbarism or socialism and not barbarism, you "if you want to be on top of this system, it will collapse, if you want to not be in on top, and and see what's behind door number two, which in your heart you don't think is possible, because remember these people are fully ideologically uh uh conditioned, whereas they don't think that the alternative to capitalism exists, so it is this, it is this and barbarism, it is barbarism, so do you want to be? the chieften, do you want to be in the castle or do you want to be sucking fucking pigshit uh in in the fields? and they've made the choice, them and their kids are going to be on the top of the fucking stick, everybody else is going to have this shit of the stick, because if it's if all this really requires is for them to just remove one layer of self-conscious ideology, the layer of capitalism actually is for the good of humanity, capitalism actually makes everybody better. off uh every uh it's free shoes, it's the Milton Frieedman fairy tale stuff that they hood winked everybody else with and that only a few of them ever really believed, but I think even now, I i think at this point even they have have let the the scales fall and what they have seen is the reality of, oh okay, no, never mind, it doesn't make everybody anything, everything better for everybody, in the long run it actually makes things very bad for everybody, but a very few, but I'm one of them and I'm going to do whatever it takes. to stay there, and if I want to have some sort of ethical reason for this, well, what about my kids, what about my family, what about the people I love, don't I have a responsibility to them? If it's all the same, if we're going down anyway, shouldn't I try to save my family, shouldn't you pull your family out of a burning car before you burs anybody else out? Isn't that responsible moral thing to do? That's why the only thing that's going to break this up is is an eruption from without and and by a working class organs of power. to disrupt the existing ones, they can't be taken over from within because within everyone within them everyone within them, i think internalize a lot of this, it's getting chilly out, damn, shit, executive outcomes is coming back, the pinkertons are rolling in it, uh, yeah, no, we're we're gonna, it's new gilded age, we got to get the gun thugs back, balden felts, black white. water uh can to fill the crack as the stake collapses it'll fill the craps it'll fill the fill the gaps fucking pinkertons man Supposedly Alan Pinkerton thwarted an assassination attempt against John uh against Lincoln uh when he was headed towards his inaugural well what the fuck where the fuck were you on April 15th you dumb motherfucker people 14 fuck. Yeah, the pinkertons are apparently also in addition to getting staffed up as as security for especially urban areas, a lot of domestic unrest, they're also creating these executive uh catastrophe. contingency packages where high what networth individuals can essentially get a uh uh like a medical alert bracelet where if the the mob shows up to the comput to the front doors or something they will they will be able to crash them out with a team of operators and extract them to a prepared remote hardened location like a bunker type deal and in addition to that the craziest one. is that last year or the year before there was a uh I think a Honda or Toyota executive, Hondai, one of the big Japanese automotive companies, there's a uh the chief the CEO was uh under house arrest on a bunch of uh finance crime charges, I think like embezzling and stuff, I'm not sure uh, and he was, but he's also he was like a um, he's also a a Lebanese citizen and he hired some fucking... black water type guys to uh sneak him out of the country on a private plane uh and then get him to first istambul and then cut out to another private plane to lebanon where he couldn't be extradited they literally just they just said yeah no i'm above the law literally nisan yeah that was it so that's like the future is here you know there's nothing, there is nothing that you could imagine that is not already in pupil prefigurative form happening right in. now of course these there's a lot of them though, not all of them are terrible, some are good, prefigur, they could be prefigurative, all depends on which ones we water, which ones we allow to eat after midnight? carlos goson, that was it, so i guess he's just still chilling in lebanon right? that would have been funny if he gotten blown up in that uh ammonium uh explosion uh somebody ask if the whiskey rebellion was a proto working class rebellion not really because you got to remember these are all small holders now we're talking. on yoman, these subjects who were the hypothetical, like the hypothetical subject of this constitutional order that was coming into being were these guys, uh, but part of that was that they had this this notion of liberty of being ungoverned that was uh, that was only viable in the context of yoman farming, which in those parts of the country, west Massachusetts and New England, that's where that model was born, because that's where it was most viable, like the land was good enough to grow stuff on, but not good, but not that good. It was, it was, it was, it was good enough for you to grow crops for yourself and family and a surplus, but you couldn't have plantation agriculture, you couldn't have large scale capital intensive agriculture in that part of the of the continent, what you could have was a small farm that could produce a surplus, and which would allow for the exchange of surplus for finished goods and the and then perhaps uh uh for more purchase of more land that would allowed for an idea of a... self-sufficient uh uh subject who was would be essentially uh for whom a state would essentially be redundant because the market transactions would regulate every part of his economic life and social life, that's where the libertarian idea comes from, and like obviously the the way that the whiskey rebellion went, the vict the victory of federalism over it. it uh, it was a victory for the Hamiltonian administrative state that was going to take these freemen and and and uh lash them and and and discipline them with with the with taxation and then later with uh with borgages and and and leans and and things like that, but in the context of creating a a modern political subject. because the thing about capitalism is it's necessary, because you have to grind through these social forms, they're not going to uh, and and more importantly, it's not even a choice, it's inherent, when you when when when uh when the the colonies got connected to the dynamo of the British uh of British industry, which is going to start the crank of Wallinsteen's world system as it wens its way around the con the continents uh the the intensification of of of of trade intensifies the need for alienating and intervening mechanisms of bureaucracy both state and private and that means alienating uh liberty away towards a center and the thing that pulled away from that process in America was the emergence of this alternative economic model, this alternative production model in the south. That is where why you were able to you saw this early contradiction because that was the central contradiction of the colonial project or the American project post colonial so it had two models of capitalist production they were both capitalist obviously there is a significant difference between small holding farming as our agricultural of agricultural staples as the as the as the uh as the model uh - and when i say model, i mean the uh the model of resource end of this, the model in the cities is the same as it is everywhere, it's it's the it's the it's the maw that chews up all those things, it eats all the food and takes all of the the the uh all of the materials, two ways to fill get this maffet, you had the small holder model and then in the south you had the plantation over time the plant as as the ability to uh extract profit. due to uh the expansion of slavery and then of course uh technological innovations like contingent, i mean the main reason that the first the first ranks of founding fathers thought that slavery was something that they could just put off was because they thought it was going to go away naturally in the near term, because it wasn't really that profitable, it wasn't really like where it was, where it was then, where it was during the the colonial and and early modern period before we expanded, it really wasn't that profitable, the soil was already getting depleated in in in the tide water, uh, like George Washington, even though he was the biggest land owner in Virginia, he had to borrow 500 bucks to go to his own inaugural because he had a bad bunch of bad harvests uh, even though he had huge, slave plantation, uh, and the margins just weren't good enough, it was cotton, and then the ability to... to make cotton uh labor uh uh labor to reduce the labor intensiveness of cotton to a point where you you could make more money make money off it uh that made it uh a viable a long-term viable mode of production and that's what changed the politics of slavery over time and blew up the constitutional order so i would say that Whisky rebellion, I don't think it's protoworking class movement in that it has the form of popular over, it has the form of a popular resistance to app. the thing is is that the the axis of oppression then is not really the one that you see in a organized working class movement within a capitalist system, a fully integrated capitalist system where the yomanry, where the yoman conception of liberty is not an overriding thing, and honestly that's what one of the chief hindrances of the American Labor movement is the persistence of the Yoman conception of liberty, that has only been protest that has been uh uh that has persisted the way it has because of our dynamic of expansion that has governed our nation until very recently, like you can say oh the frontier closed in the 1890s, yes, but that's when we started our colonial wars and then very quickly uh we became the inheritors of a globning empire. it was all, i really think that the the myth died with irak. man, those fucking obelisks, one of the things that that they've really taken from us is any ability to have any wonder about anything, because no one could have seen that for a second and not immediately thought, oh this is viral marketing for some bullshit, and maybe it isn't, maybe it's not. Maybe there's nothing else that ever happens, it's like, hey, what was the deal with those oboluss that we never find out? It's too late then, and it's all going to be a slow, like there will never, there can be no collective intake of breath, because everything we see we inherently distrust, as we should. Yeah it's getting shilly oh god the clowns guys the clowns thank you for reminding me about the clowns that was probably the one thing that more than anything should have told you that in retrospect that Trump was should have was going to win not because he's orange just because that kind of thing happening people are people are viviving on a weird people are viving people are waiting for something. people are, they're tasting something in the air, something's getting weird, and honestly I wonder if the fact that Trump won stopped the clown thing, if it was just that clown, like him being president diffused the energy that was turning into and it was expressing itself in in weird clowns, and if Hillary had won, maybe the clown thing would have had become a like a real extended phenomenon involving body counts and and and uh cults and shit, or unless it was all viral marketing for it, unless it was viral marketing for it, because if it was and they were cool about it, we never would have known, they weren't going to say, hey, this is for it, because like if they're really smart, they don't, no, it's you program them deeply enough, you don't have to make the connection, they'll make it for themselves, Yeah, this applot of the movie joker, and I wonder if Trump being president didn't like divert, divert us from the joker timeline, at least temporarily, now with Biden getting back in here and and like the normal folk, the the adults in the room again, does that mean that jokerification is gonna start back up, are we gonna start seeing clowns again, clowns in uh m95 masks, we'll see after inauguration day, after v becomes president and doesn't get arrested by Michael Flyn after they wave the servers around uh that I think you might see jokerification and intensifying. I am going to become the joker. Damn right, damn right, you are, we all are, we're all going to be the joker, sooner or later. We're all getting jokerpied. but no, i feel like i i went through my jokerification phase and i came out the other end and hopefully we will come out of the other end collectively of our jokerification phase uh feeling feeling like we're we're we're changed evolved upward maybe fingers crossed. Oh god, koma, I, I, I still think the funniest thing would be, it's John in 2024, because it's so... so nothing more perfectly democratic about a guy wasting a fuck ton of money to lose a center a house race, the most money I think anybody had ever used to lose a house race, then taking another boat load of money, burning it, just burning it, flushing it down the toilet to lose twice the same senate race and then he gets the nomination as the president so that he can like end up spending $3 billion dollars to lose to John Taffer or Larry the cable guy, or Larry the cable guy and John Taffer strapped together like master blaster, that would be, that would be perfect, god I got to got this, I keep thinking that the 2024 Republican candid, if it's not Trump will be John Jr. and I know that everyone was like, and myself, I agree, he has none of... his father's raw charisma or talent of any kind, he's a perfectly null fail son, the ideal fail son, uh, but honestly, I think that takes, that doesn't take into account how much stupider and more pathetic things are going to be in 2024, how much lower is everyone's expectation going to be of anything, and how much will the toad-like anti-charisma of Donald Jr. uh, end up winning just by virtue. of having some some transient trans, some uh some transferred valor, some stolen uh vibe from his dad compared to the fucking other wet dish rags who run against him, so yeah we'll see, we'll see i have a feeling, i mean we'll see how we'll see how things are, maybe they won't be so stupid, maybe people will be less dumb, but hey awesof versus don Jr. i think could be an amazing election, let's all let's
