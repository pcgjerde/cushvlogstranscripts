Thank you to Nickdonons for that uh, I told him I wanted, I had that had something like um, you know, a drum and fife feel with a spaghetti western element to it, and I think he totally, I think he completely nailed that, so thank as alway, thank you as always to nick Diamonds for the theme, all right, here we are, the hell. President's wrap up stream uh, I had a few questions prepared, some kind of general chat topics to begin with, and then uh, you know, maybe 20, 30 minutes we'll take some questions and do some overall thoughts on the show, so Matt, you ready for my first question, me, all right, so behind us we have the new fire from Johnton, his magnificent seven of US presidents, uh, I guess my main question about this is, at what point we're going to watch it. got to turn off the uh the sound um why what point did john f Kennedy get completely engulfed into conservative presidential cannon uh it's been a bit now uh and I think you saw people calling themselves like Kennedy Republicans so I think probably like during the Bush years and I think it it really does, and it really accelerated, I think after uh, 2008, because as shit started to go downhill dramatically, people start looking back and saying, where was the real uh breach, and a lot of republicans came to the same conclusion that like Oliver Stone and a lot of the liberal boomers had come to a while ago, which is the Kennedy assassination, and the fact that Kennedy was a cold. warrior who cut taxes uh and who obviously because you know this is the he was the president right before the culture wars exploded he didn't really have any record on culture war stuff so you were able to sort of uh imagine him as the as uh like the just the way that stone saw him is like our our last legitimate sovereign uh and now with que and on he's literally become a magical figure and his son is basically I mean they have they have recreated Sunni Islam or Shia Islam now and uh and JFK Jr. is their uh accluded it's pretty amazing are those guys still hanging out? they were last time i checked uh, it's a pretty amazing dedication to it, you don't see that much uh true believer shit uh in us politics and for that alone you have to hand it to those guys, oh you got to hand it to them, they've forged a a real like a theological conception of politics that uh has transcended sort of the powerlessness of of of being like the rest of us just hastage to the spectacle because you know the... participating in magical rights and shit to to bring back jafe K's kid who's going to lead us to the promised land. All right, so my real question on this is, if you were assembling your team of presidential operators to do some kind of mission, who would be your magnificent seven? Let me just say by the way, that this one, the one that uh, the one that Mcnaughton has put together, I would not have these guys, I would not give them the green light to do a fucking raid on a a puppy mill, this is a... terrible collection of operators, I wouldn't give any of these guys guns, Thomas Jefferson, weedy Nerd, never picked up a gun in anger in his life, Ronald Reagan literally senile his entire presidency, uh, okay, Washington I'll give you obviously, yes uh, but like Trump has not driven a car, go in his entire life, absolutely, Abe Lincoln, okay, another one, I'll give you Rangey former wrestler, uh, and backwards experience, tr was like... chad when he was uh you know in the ruff riders but by the time he was president he was basically shaped like a barrel uh and then JFK famously racked with illnesses and diseases uh needing doctor feel good injections every day to stay alive uh adison's disease uh bad back all kinds of shit so this is a this is a trash group if i'm do if i'm getting my operator presidents together uh i'm fixing the base and one thing that he here uh McNawton does not know his us military combat doctrine because with any group of uh soldiers this big or or uh a squad sized group like he's got here where the fuck is the heavy gunner heavy gunner is is a required uh somebody with like a squad automatic weapon or something somebody to lay down suppressive fire with something belt fed and FDR is basically a technical. so just strap a fucking gattling gun to him and you you have a perfect firebase that you can then move around, so start with FDR is technical, I would keep, I would keep nick, I would keep linking, because Lincoln was relatively young for a president, uh, relatively fit, uh, then I got to go Grant, uh, who was a skilled horseman uh, and athlete his entire life. uh and who uh famously was ticketed for speeding in a carriage in DC when he was president uh uh uh Gerald Ford the jock yes he's on my list as well he's he's your big dumb guy yeah you just give him like a shotgun set him out there uh I'll I'll keep Washington in there he he's he is he was another jap absolut Jock uh, no Andrew Jackson, because once again by the time he was president, he was being hollowed out by Dropsy. See, Jackson is on my list for his wild card status, you got to have a guy, you got to have a uh, an absolute wild man on the team, you know, that is true, and uh, you also need uh, somebody who might uh, go crazy and kill your guys too, Telly Savales in uh, dirty, dirty dancing, dirty dozen style. and that's where Nixon comes in for me, oh yeah, I was thinking about that, all right, I've got Washington the leader, uh, Teddy, Special Ops, uh, FDR, heavy gunner, I think that works, uh, but you know, also get a little bit of uh brains and you can even slot them in in a kind of gentleman spy roll if you need that, uh, Lincoln, the heart, the conscience, he's your your Brooklyn on the on the team, the the kid, uh, LBJ, interrogations. uh, you get you get him alone in a room and he's gonna, he's going to get inside your head, he's going to make you uh, you know, give, give up your own mother within 20 minutes, uh, jackson, as I said, the wild card, and of course uh, Ford, president football, dumb muscle, uh, frontlines, that's my, that's my uh magnificent seven, that's that's all solid, just don't put two senial boxes of suit on your team, that's all I can say, um, all right, so... that's that's the mcnotton uh photo that that's the uh presidential magnificent seven um pulk i see somebody saying in the chat as i said in our final episode someone i'm i'm also fascinated with their chat status he might be the jackson that can do it you know the jackson who's still uh still hickerry yeah yeah although once again his last he died almost immediately after he left office from the poop water yeah well i mean you give them water filtration system you know and then you've cured his still suit yeah exactly you you give pulk a still suit you've cured his major weakness yeah all right moving on to my next topic of discussion this is something i pulled from the uh the acid marxism subredit uh shout out to those guys uh the the simple plantive question, is the candidate who appears like they could lay the best pipe desind to win every election? and i think there are many ways you can uh phrase this question, the way i always uh thought of it in my mind is the um the president who looks most who looks like they would be most comfortable eating a mcdonald's cheeseburger? yeah, i mean it's all part of the same general nexus, which is the coolest, yes exactly, the coolest canon. wins, and and I think that's generally true, I think they there are certain, the ways, the times that it's not true it is more that it's just been a race to the bottom of nertery, like the time where you're going to have a tough time uh calling it is like HW versus Deucachus, right? well see there you give it to HW just on hype. Ducacus was like 5-5 or 56 something and and uh George Hw I believe is 62 one of her college president so. Yeah, that's not a cat, like height is 90% of coolness anyway, I mean sorry, short kings, I'm sorry, you guys are, you guys are trying to push a bolder up a hill socially, we all know this, so that one, yes, uh, HW for the height, and also i don't know if he was any good at fucking, but he certainly did it a lot, uh, when he was at Skull and Bones, he was nicknamed mammen, and Mamen was the nickname reserved for the horniest member of that uh, that uh, crew, season, whatever the fuck you call them of of... um, how about then, how would you resolve like Ford versus Carter? another, another two uh, a relatively swaggless election, that's very swagless and you could say, poi Ford's got uh, you know, Ford's got the football thing, what Carter had that made him a little more swaggy, uh, one, he told playboy that he had lust in his heart, which which I mean if he's horny, presumably that's more than you can say for Ford, that is about the... famous way that you could say that you're horny, especially in like the mid-70s, you know, it's true, uh, but I would say that what Carter gets Carter over the line there is that he had all of the cool young hollywood people on his side, he had like uh, you know, your warren baties and your and also like willy Nelsons and you had like uh the postwater gate like the that is really when like the first time you have like a countercultural mainstream yeah right uh yeah uh and they were behind Carter, so he got that, he got the wind there, but yeah, personally, a total fucking dort, uh, they were, and they were both, you know, of similar generations and you know both world war I guys, but you know, while even in in their expression of their generation, I mean like Ford, Ford's World War II experience was like teaching Marines football and Carter was like learning how to operate nuclear submarines, no, it was all, was all classroom. little futurist though, you know, yeah, no, they were both nerd leaners, um, it's actually interesting, there's we have no world war 2 combat veterans, there were no world war 2 combat veterans uh, who became present, because uh, Kennedy was a boat a boat guy who got his boat cut in half, uh, Nixon uh, hung around in a rear Echelon base playing cards at a little hamburger stand he built called nicks where he won the... money to buy his first suit to run for congress with uh, i mean the level of strive for Nixon is just off the charts, you have to, and of course LBJ hilariously just went on a recon mission as a sitting congressman and then strong armed them army into giving him a fucking uh award for like withstanding enemy fire that did not happen that uh also uh very strive uh very much like that as well yeah and uh yeah and then of course Reagan fucking did uh uh he made uh movies for the army uh he was like it was a captain in a military unit that was based in in Hollywood uh and then of course yeah Ford and Carter a couple of fucking point exters and then George HW fighter uh bomber pilot uh who almost got eaten you know which is pretty intense but but the only uh World War II uh combat veteran I believe is even ran was Bob Dowl who got his arm shock to shit at Monte Casino. There's actually a pretty hilarious in retrospect story that kind of helps explain why he became such a bitter freak of him. uh taking a train home to Kansas uh after the war in a full cast with like his arm out you know like a luni tones cast yes exactly like a cartoon and he's in the he's like they can't there's no seat for him so he's like in the in the uh lounge and people would be put it they put his their cigarettes out and his cast they put it out in the in the in the in his uh the corner of his of his arm uh is still alive, amazing, yeah, outlived uh, norm, hilariously, uh, all right, so I'm trying to remember the last combat veteran president at all, um, somebody points out in the chat, uh, truman, truman was a artillery in during world war one, so that's probably it, uh, yes, yeah, and I mean, I don't think I don't think. Eisenhower ever fought, he was always a perfect age to ever have avoided an actual uh, military conflict, so I think it was, yeah, I think it's Trueman being an artilleryman in the in the western front, um, well that so, okay, so those are my two uh, fun dumb stuff, uh, I would say to just finish answering that question, uh, whoever you could say objectively has the most swag or is the coolest, I think that that's going to be get you like 80% there, I think you can bet like, like, it's so... four out of five on um on on who's the coolest even the the the trump biden the thing is thaters think that Trump is way cooler than he is and he's an off-putting weirdo to everybody else exactly and the thing is when you're running against Hillary Clinton it doesn't matter buse she's even more offputting yeah but the thing about Biden is is that he might be I mean he's obviously an avatar of everything wrong with politics in the last 40 years uh he is genuinely senile and unfit for the office, but he's also he's got a minimal swag that Trump could never approximate, like the other day when he was uh at the uh the Ford factory and he fucking floored that EV, that that like electric hummer, they never let Trump actually drive any of the trucks they put in the front yard of the white house, yes yeah he's got uh Biden has the bare minimum normy swag, he wears the aviators, he can still look decent in like a short sleeved. shirt at age 79 or whatever he he is and when you got uh going just mile a minute like winding like a uh like a like norma desmond at a debate and then you have bidon going you shut up man that's cooler yeah he has the even just like the certain steadied calmness has that that minimum coolness that that gets you there so but we'll we'll see but then it comes and goes bause if Trump comes back he's going to be coming back as like the ci told you so guy, he's going to have four years off, and presumably Trump, I mean, and presumably at that point Biden will be like uh, commander Pique on Star Trek and communicating with like a beeping box, we'll be facing harris, in which case the swag like, the swag gap is catastrophic, yes, the thing I'm imagining though is like say Trump doesn't get the nomination for some reason, the his hand explodes, whatever, and like it ends up being somebody like Jos Josh Hallway or uh or Tom Cotton versus Harris, you might see the first zero swag election, yes, as as Felix has been saying in his 3000 uh vote election uh prediction uh somebody says uh love that Biden loser hero, the love the Biden Loser energy, yes every time I think about Biden now, I think about the song deacon blues by steely Dan uh, he the the perfect anthem for the loser hero, It's amazing how he's absorbed just he's he's there now with like what a in the 30s uh uh approval and is he whining about it is he doing the Trump thing he's just absorbing it's like this is what i was born to do yes all right well this is actually a good segway now into the uh first serious uh more serious question that i had uh for this stream which is is uh we kind of purposely cut off the uh narrative part of our series at Biden's inauguration um we felt we were a little too early in it to give it the kind of historical consideration that we were trying to do with the rest of the series uh but you know now we're you know one year out from the election um we have at least a few events and a few indications of um you know uh the leadership style or even what is possible from a president in the Biden administrations. so uh, I know this is pretty broad, but uh, Matt, do you have any uh thoughts on the first, year or so of the Biden administration and how he is uh, fitting into the presidential narrative. first off I just want to say someone asked in the chat is Biden Yott Rock? Absolutely. Yes, he is. Yeah, just you can imagine him on a boat, plain of saxophone in the background. He's back in the high life again, folks, yes after 30 years of crawling for the white house, he's there even though he doesn't know it, which is of course part of the just amazing tragedy of his life. I think that his his presidency so far, largely uh along the lines that I imagined it going, which is... "he is here as our uh sinn eater and as our psychopomp leading us to the underworld, uh, he is the president of, he is the end of the line, he is the guy who is putting a cap on an experience, who's who is narrating uh our our drive towards extinguishment uh in an attempt to uh get us to terms with it as opposed to Trump who tried to rage against it, and that's why it's very likely that Trump will become president." again because nobody wants to hear uh that they're that they're being put to sleep uh and like even the Afghanistan uh drawdown which is such a relative I think a shock to a lot of people and which clearly went against the uh the high mind preference and the you know material interests of the military industrial political media pharmaceutical entertainment complex uh even that's in the same genre because out of Afghanistan eventually uh it was at that point merely a a money pump, it's just a way to transfer money from one zip code in northern Virginia to another, but it's strategic purpose had been exhausted and with the need to redirect towards China more uh important than ever uh as someone was going to have to cut bait there. was Biden because he could do it, he could take it as they said about the dark knight, he could deal with everyone calling him a coward and a loser and a fuck up and a betray of America for three weeks, for three weeks, no other president could have handled that, obama literally was given the option and blinked at the prospect, so did Trump, he wanted to pull out uh in I believe March of 20 or February, March 2020, they told him, this is going to happen, and he was too afraid of looking like a loser. Byan doesn't care, and he doesn't care about sheperding through, you know, dog shit, bare minimum, keep the lights on, infrastructure spending, through a broken system, doesn't care about the fact that his party is basically going to be legislated out of the ability to form a majority in the near future, uh, because he's he's the caretaker, he's here to to put it all uh to keep it on the rails uh until just the... ability of the entire center is exhausted and that's going to be the the that's all that he can be, which is why the republic democrats are so fucked because that's that only works if you are the last president you know that only looks works if you are actually like transitioning over to a new political reality of course we can't do that we're stuck like when you look at long running horror movie series and like it's like episode or blank six the final chapter and then there are like four more movies after that, right? it's like this narrative ends with him, but it can't because we're stuck, because we're paralyzed, because we have been depositicized to the degree that we can't respond to changing conditions with anything other than performance, spectacle and uh sort of almost erotic paralysis. so that means we're going to keep electing presidents even though, we have the guy now who do be like honestly he should be uh negotiating a leveraged buyout by the chinese, that that's what reasonably logically should be happening right now, the America is extinguished as a project, there's still some vitality and energy, and most importantly political subjectivity in China, I know that's funny to say, like LOL, oh there you know one party dictatorship, but the Chinese communist party is able to intervene in its uh economy, it is able to as a group of people, side of capitalism impos their will on like the engines of uh the economy in a way that nobody in the American is capable of doing and so that means that there's actually some uh viability and uh legitimacy in that uh regime that we don't have so he should be he should be signing the papers on our surrender uh and we should get go on the Missouri again. closing time other than an attempt to bring back the... Obama politics, which was predicated on hope, is predicated on a a vision of progress that can no longer be sustained, like we're in terminal crisis conditions, everyone's aware of it, like democrats are terrified of republicans and all the democrats are going to have in the form of Camala Harris or in the form of Mayor Pete, is a identity-based validation. argument that this system with new leadership that is more diverse and reflective of our demographics, will govern more uh effectively, more justly, but the legitimacy of the machine is so undermined that uh, i don't think even a lot of loyal democrats believe that it can be redeemed with anything other than confrontation that the democratic party is incapable of, so they really are uh absolutely fucked that really. seems to be the case doesn't it uh the just point after point being like what is what even is the project here as far as the uh democrats are concerned and even you know throughout the entire entirety of the 2020 election at least you had trump to organize the thing is in opposition to uh but immediately upon getting in power you're like uh okay so now where is the road map here and there isn't one uh so uh i mean you know in light of our conversations talking about how the breakdown of party systems is tends to be the moment that these new formations occur that give moments of opportunity uh, you know, the breakdown of our current party system, seems like it might be a moment of opportunity, but the way things are chicking out, it uh, it's certainly hard to get the hopes up for that, but you know, we are at this terminal crisis for both parties, like there and Trump's election was the result of the republican party essentially. down as a political machine, which is also happening to the democratic party, and really in both cases, the crisis in the one party is masked by the crisis in the other, right? like, you don't have this, a full asymmetry where both are breaking apart simultaneously, and and everyone recognizes that, instead, the failures of the one party, the crisis within the one party allows the other party some vision of how they can win, like so republicans have their idea of... of you know Jerry Mandering and culture war cancelling elections, yeah, the democrats have their idea of uh of uh intersectional representation as their raise on debt, like abandoning everything other than the idea that they will prevent white men from being in charge, uh, that's um, and both of those are uh, in a context. the parties are at the whim of whoever is funding uh the candidates and whoever is the media decides to pay attention to uh and so they can't impose any centralized will, all they could do is play the game of uh of shaping the media narrative and the republicans though have a more uh effective political project because everything is aligned in the same direction broadly uh the grassroots is aligned with their voting base which is aligned with their funder base right in the democrats you have a fundamental conflict between the the voters and would be voters for the democrats and then their core electorate and then even between that the core electorate and the funding baseers uh continuity so they they cannot function with the same efficiency that the republicans can. add to that they're built in advantage uh created by the constitutional system uh and the sorting mechanism of democrats moving to blue enclaves and therefore deluding their electoral power uh so they have that built in advantage uh and so they're going to be in a position where they might just be able to hold on to national power, but the thing is, all they can do is stoke culture war, all they can do is stoke resentment, they cannot address any of the material causes of all this anxiety and anger uh and uh and destabilizing social dysfunction, they can't address it, so it's only going to get worse, right? uh, and that is going to create a political uh resistance, a political uh, uh, face to opposition to this republican party, and I don't think at this point it can be the democrats, but that doesn't mean? but it can't persist, you know, yeah, yeah, so the hope is, the hope is that this crisis has to resolve in some new formation emerging, because of the insufficiency of the democrats to address the moment, but you know, the cost of that is going to be some horrifying shit, and uh, but and people say that's accelerationism, but it's really just a recognition of the reality that the democrats have seased to be anything but a road block towards uh uncontested republican control of the... federal government and most states? yeah, i don't know, it uh, i guess it kind of like reminds me of uh, you know the period in the 1920s uh where you had to have, i mean basically like a total collapse of the party for it to be reborn and you there needs to be like a a the total control eventually leads to delegitimization, i'm talking about the republicans here, if we're just imaging this uh, the continuation of this two party system. one could imagine that even with all of these uh institutional uh measures that they were putting in place is the Jerry Manders um you know the the voting blocks uh or the blocks to voter registration and the blocks of voting rights and stuff like that uh that it could lead to a near term like total domination for a period of I don't decade a decade more than a decade uh you know during which the current formulation of democrats will you know scream will yell about authoritarianism and fascism. which you may or may not be true to certain degrees, but at a certain point things then you might rig in total control of the country at such a level that at a certain point there's no one left to blame but you, and then there might be another vessel, another formulation of the Democratic party that operates und under different principles, say like say FDR taking control of the party in 1932, that allows a different kind of... different form of the democrats to ascend after the republican domination and all this is like based on a million contingencies and a totally fantasized reading of the future but you know it happened a hundred years ago um and so why not? i i agree completely. i think though that the conditions have changed in key respects that when that formulation emerges, which it will, it is not going to be a national political party, democrat or otherwise. i feel like we will by that point have reached. a a critical uh crisis in the system of federalism, and that if there is a resurgent, anti-republican, effective anti-republican political movement that is able to take power through elections, because we're assuming the continuation of the system, it's going to be at the state level, because we're seeing every, when every president gets in, we are seeing conflict between federal and state. authority uh where the other party is in power get worse and worse uh and if you see republican domination of the federal government, I don't think states like California and and New York uh are just going to go along with it because they won't have to uh, because they will be able to assert a lot of authority as states and yes like lead towards bringsmanship with the federal government, I think that. on the table no matter what assuming the continued slide of uh background economic conditions and accelerated social atomization caused by the terminal crisis of capitalism right which i is my underlying assumption that that goes along with that is the framework for all of my analysis of America's history is is that what's driving these conflicts is the the condition of the uh economic momentum where on the chart basically the economy is and we're we're a point now after the 70s and then specifically after 2008 when the uh the material basis for the American economy has become fully unmored uh from the actual uh like finance economy that we all live in like we are 2008 was was uh the end finally of the last bubble based on uh you know real uh material the real estate like it is now fully financialized right uh and it's been kept alive purely by massive liquidity pumped in at the top of the economy by the fed outside of government uh any kind of democrat real democratic uh oversight uh and and that means things can only really get worse, like we can have upswings in the economy, but in terms of people's more than even their conditions there. sense of their conditions, right? their sense of uh precariity can only get worse uh, and if that's the case, the pressure on this federal system, which is already uh loosening, is only going to get more intense? uh, well, with that grim reading of the future, you saw somebody in the chat saying like this all sounds like hope, i think when we were talking about you, a reformation of the party system, we're fucked uh, yeah, we the... i think the operative word in that is we. who are we? buse the idea is that a future a future collection of powers will be a different group of we, you know, so precisely, yeah, so we might be fucked in the short in the short run, we might be fucked in the long run, but in the future we will be part of a different we, is the idea, that's that is the thing that people forget most is that people in the past are in a fundamental way different than with than we are, and people in the future will be fundamentally different, the things that go into their life experience are going to be different, the way that they define words, yes, is going to be different, the way that they act from symbols is going to be different, the their value system is going to be different, and that means that we can predict what the what the contour is generally of our you, what, what declining conditions and and accelerating. mean for our social institutions as we understand them now, right? we can't know how people are going to respond to them in the future. well, most of all, i hope that the people of the future bring uh perfidity back. all right, let's uh, let's uh, go to the chat, uh, if anybody has any questions uh about the series about how we put it together, about uh presidents in general, about the future about the past, um, anything relating to the series, um, we would be happy to answer um and i'll keep my eyes in the chat um let's see let's see okay yes uh chest somebody says why skip chester arthur we spent a total of about uh 30 seconds less than a minute on chester a Arthur uh do you have any other chester a Arthur facts you'd like to do just to give him his his time uh chestry Arthur uh although I feel like we covered him more in the in the final. Yeah, we talked about him a little bit in the last episode, because we had missed him, yeah, so we kind of, he is actually uh, he, um, too short a shift, uh, in addition to be facial here, God, he was the uh, first president to have a uh, a birth certificate scandal, because he was born in Vermont, and he was accused for the most of his life of having actually. been born in Canada um and he is a collector of customs, yeah, now not, you just, anybody who got in there uh in the 19th century because somebody died, just not much going on, uh, hopefully a matz system uh, resolves itself, for a second, we were having a little connection problems earlier, if uh, the worst that will happen, he'll have to log back on, or log off and log back on, mad, if you can hear me, maybe you want to do that. uh, I will answer one real quick, why, why the name hell of presidents? uh, that name was actually uh suggested uh, most, oh, Matt's back, uh, I was just moving on to why name it held presence, uh, I just did want to talk about this, that name was actually suggested by Branson Reese when I asked him to do a drawing for the series of like a hall of presidents type thing, and he was like, well, you could just put hell in there, and I was like, you know what, that's good enough, because uh, Matt and I tried to fuck time up with a good name for the series from about January to June, uh, and nothing fucking stuck. yeah, it was brutal. what were some of the ones we had? uh, failed of the chief? yes, um, god, i can't even remember. it it was so sorry. if anybody has a better name for what the series should have been please please let me know. i like telepresidents when i heard it is like thank god. we don't have to think of one now. um, yeah, oh god, there was one that i was really set on and then somebody had somebody had already named it. um, uh, matt Christman's. presidents i think there already is a oh yeah we called that for a while uh i think there already is a uh dead presidents podcast hosted by like some school teacher i didn't want to like steal their um steal their their steal their valor no uh i i it ended up working out i mean my god our other show is called chapo trap house we're lucky we're not we're not hitting hittings with names it's not a strong suit yeah um let's see where else have all US elections been corrupt, we kind of we were going to go into this more in the elections episode, but you kind of had to do your entire history of the US in in one go, uh, yeah, talk more about how corrupt US elections have been over time? I mean it, it it raises, it makes you wonder how, what do you mean by corrupt, because like if you're talking about non-democratic, they all have been, you know, they've all failed crucial tests of access that would allow you to call them fair elections, uh, but if you want to talk about like intervening in the uh races like against the rule. uh, pretty much always, yeah, as soon as people started, regular people started voting in US presidential elections, there were plenty of ways to ensure some sort of influence over the results, so for most of the 19th century, elections were not secret, there was no secret ballot, you did not drop your card into a uh a box the way the... you imagine it in old Cartoon, they were often public assemblies where you had to give your uh, verbally give your vote, and of course you know local uh political machines could game that system and and influence people that way, it was a way to guarantee that if you bribe somebody that they voted for you, and it was a way to intimidate people uh who might vote for somebody else, so uh that that persisted for most of the... the 19th century, in addition to you know all the jugging and and vote vote buying that happened in the cities uh, and then of course you have the mass disenfranchisement of black voters in the south beginning in the reconstruction era that basically invalidates every election until 1968 or 72 from even consideration of not being corrupt, because you know that is that was done extralegally well before it was modified in law, it was done through like violent suppression all through that era uh, because as we said, like these were legal voters according to the constitution, were prevented by local statute and local power from uh carrying out their election, and then you had things like the rotten brows in uh the real grand valley that uh Lindon Johnson used to assure his presence, his senatorial election in uh 1948, so in Texas, uh, it was understood that there were certain countries that were completely up for sale in any election. local uh judges uh were essentially able to uh, if you paid them enough, collect a a guaranteed number of votes, because the people who lived there in these countries were mostly uh uh very poor working class uh mexicans with very little political representation, and they were bribed and caralled. into voting on Mas uh and the keydu winning an election wasn't even buying uh the votes, it was making sure that uh you announce them at the right moment, so in 1944, Linda Johnson runs for president for for senate in Texas for the first time, challenging uh Papy O'Daniel who is a real guy uh and a real governor and senator from Texas uh passed the biscuits Papio Danielle. uh, and both had bought votes in rural Counties, and towards the end of the primary night, LBJ has a relatively comfortable lead and he tells his operatives to release their counts and so that gave O'Daniel time to have his countries announce the number of votes they needed, so every election was basically a game of chicken to see who would announce their their results first, uh, and in 48. he defeated uh Coke Stevenson uh he did it by wholesale vote buying in the Rial Grand Valley uh and just vote fabrication they were just putting numbers in randomly they were picking out roles of registered voters and just putting their names and and mass uh fraud like they were just all uh counterfitting signatures in mass and then they announced just enough it was under 50 votes that's why they called them landslide lining uh but of course the funny thing is was that in that election, which was decided basically because the state Texas democratic party chose to acknowledge Johnson's victory, the the right thing was done, because this was 1948, this is right after uh World War II, this is the beginning of the post war fight that had been put on a sort of highis during the course of the war between Democrats and Republicans for power and Coke Stevenson. Johnson's opponent was a old line southern small government reactionary, and of course he was also a democrat because Texas was a one-party state at that point, and Johnson. have been a good new dealer uh and the new deal uh veterans in the democratic party texas were like we want the new dealer in Washington not this fucking uh stets and wearing asshole uh so the these practices were common well into the middle of the 20th century famously JFK won with the aid of illegal ballots in Chicago although one thing people forget to point out is that you could wonder, well if there were all this vote buying and vote rigging in Chicago, they're they're getting all the dead people in in uh Clark County to vote for democrats, why didn't the republicans challenge that in the court? It's because in southern Illinois, which was republican held, they were also stealing votes and rigging ballots, and they didn't want that to be revealed by a challenge, so everybody at that point is still... able to significantly uh influence elections illegally. i would say, and then you know, post 72, the elections i think do get more transparent, and i think the elections do get less uh, crooked in a classic sense, because you have the advent of modern campaign financing, which means what's you don't need to rig anything? you don't need to get into the machines, you don't need to uh to get a bunch get. uh phone book and just start writing votes now, you're in charge of the process, yes thought the whole thing, you've bought it fully, and it certainly so why the hell do you need to rig anything? yeah, it certainly gets more like standardized uh, you know as the um primary and calcus system gets into place, but you know even then you know as we saw in Iowa last year, there's lots of room for party chicanery uh around you know actually the functioning of these cuuse it's again you're you are the party. running an election to select your own leader so you know it's since it's all within one structure there's always uh places for for manipulation what's amazing though is that I would say that right now uh in in relative terms we have the cleanest elections we've ever had like I said that's because they're all bought and paid for up front legally so they don't need to do criminal shift for the most part but I'd say we have the most transparent election system we've ever had and it is the least legitimate it has ever been in the public mind, like nobody really thinks that elections are fair anymore at all. everybody assumes the other side is cheating. now republicans it is now uh a a fundamental uh article of faith that defines being a Republican, and that is very worrying, it is going to give these guys in their own mind permission to do anything, because they think they've already live in a lawless world where elections don't aren't real, so it doesn't matter. uh, they will be... getting the right results, which is the correct political position, because the republican party is still a political project, which the democratic party isn't, so the republican party can actually seek power in individually, like people will be motivated to seek power, democrats largely are not motivated to seek power, because they're really there to just show up and to provide the system with legitimacy, as part of a ritualized politics, so the... is why that is the party that is decided that these elections are rigged, even though democrats can only ever get their shit together to keep the left out of primaries and is essentially incapable otherwise of doing anything that requires that level of sophistication and coordination, because they're going to act, so they they need to give themselves a a narrative justification for it, but even liberals, i think like broadly don't think the elections are uh fair, they really do think that. "Russia made Trump win, and of course left fully delegitimized uh the electoral system even if they participate in it, so you have complete uh disbelief in the like basic legitimacy of the electoral system, at a time when it's as transparent as it ever has been, which is what's worrying about it, because that means there can be no uh, remedy for it, it's like when people were pissed off about graft in the late 1800s, there were things that there could be done that would actually change the..." of graph there was you know like like getting rid of the uh bounty system and then the the uh fee system for civil servants and instituting uh a ameritocratic uh testing system for appointment that's actual stuff that actually moves the needle this is a fantasy concern which means it can never be remedied other than by the destroying of the system well i think then to actually remedy it or address uh address it that uh the democrats need to go um you know think two steps ahead and actually pass laws to make uh the elections less transparent uh go back to ward healers go back to uh you know the rough coopings and stuff like that uh to so that the elections then conform to the level of suspiciousness that everybody has in their heads that they actually are and then you can just start buying the votes again uh or stuffing ballots or whatever uh let's move on from this question uh to one just about uh making the series a little bit uh i saw a few uh questions a while ago uh do you have a favorite episode matt or what was your favorite one to work on uh i i specifically have an answer for this uh, but you know, um, I think it's i think it's for me, it's the uh, I think it's the, I can't remember the name of it, but it's the one about uh, the the 60's to the 80s, the invisible bridge, invisible bridge, yeah, I think that's my favorite one, uh, there i will say as we recorded this, we recorded them mostly in order, we recorded the first version of the first episode um on Biden's inauguration day uh last January, we weren't quite satisfied with it, so we went back in and did a second recording of that episode, um, and so we recorded them as I like finished writing the outlines and then brought them matt, we got one basically every three or four weeks uh up through the entire process, uh, but my favorite... once to record and put together uh and do um where I went out to LA in the middle of the summer and I saved up the progressive episode, the 20's episode, the the roring 20s episode and the um FDR episode, and we recorded them all in one day live together in person in Matt's house, and I think that those are a lot of fun, I think the 20s one is one that... i really enjoyed just because i think that that time is very you know uh it's lighter than the times that go around it uh and so it can be like it's this little fun bubble where everybody is buy charging things on credit and doing the Charleston yeah uh and i i find those those presidents uh goofy so um we that was like one nine-hour recording session and i uh uh uh thought that that was a fun day i also like that invisible bridge episode i generally towards the end i was getting a little. worried that the whole thing was going to come off the rails as we got towards uh more towards modern time, but I actually think that um not to pat ourselves on the back that I I was, I was kind of surprised by how well the last three or so episodes of the series um came off because there just becomes gets to be so much stuff there uh that you can go into that you know obviously the episode lengths got longer but um I i i ended up coming out of those feeling more confident than I thought I was going to be uh going. in yes and also of course like the little magician, oh yes, yes, because I do feel like uh, that one has a really good uh, kind of a unique structure where we're going back and forth on the uh the bios, uh duiling banjos on on Jackson versus van Buren, yes, yeah, the uh, the face and the brain, yeah, um, but they were all good, it's it's it was an interesting project because basically every episode. we were we had an outline going in where we had basically broken them up by chunks, we had a lot of ways that we were going to do it at first uh one of our first ideas was it was going to be just like 10 or so highlight presidents and we were going to pick all the uh loser weird ones to be the names of the episode you know the ideas like instead of Lincoln you do Johnson that's the episode instead of Jackson you do Vamburen instead of you know um whatever instead of Teddy Roosevelt you do uh taft and the idea is that we were trying to think of it as a um you know there there are the the presence are usually the highlights, the great the great men or whatever, but you got to look at how their terms and actions resolve to really see where the history goes and that's usually the uh the lesser men after or before them, um, but you know we we've eventually figured out our format to this um, yeah, i just couldn't figure out a way to uh contextualize things, because if you just talk about like the one guy, you got to talk about what happened before. were them and and how do you do that without like talking about that specific president? so we ended up just saying fuck it and doing all of them, but i think that considering it in that first way really helped us format it because when we were dividing them into chunks and obviously there are like different eras to this, i did think that it helped kind of thinking about like you're building to something each episode, it's like a string of guys who build to a climax and then a resolution in in the specific era, so that's to me um kind and and that way you're not just doing them chronologically, it's like these three guys then these three guys and that's why you know the first episode is just washington and then we run through like the first 30 years or so of of the presidents. um during the second one, because what you really want to get to is the breakdown of that first party system in John Quince adams and then you just do two guys at once because you want to see the rise of the democracy and then it's first falter with vampire and so stuff like that um all right uh let's let's see here's un interesting one matt a kind of counterfactual if you could make the other guy win in any election which which one? would be, that's a good one, that's good, and I actually hadn't thought of this, all right, let me think, so yeah, like flip, okay, all right, because we've done a lot, I mean, okay, go, I, honestly, just as like a way to test things, because there seem to be such a wide variety of of of uh contrafactuals and because that presidency ended up being like the folkrum of our entire lives as adults, got to. Bush Gore right? Oh yeah, I mean yeah, that's cuz you know does 911 happen. Uh, if it does, is the result the same? I mean, there's a lot of questions, getting to just getting to teleport into the universe uh, where Bushgore was resolved the other way for like 30 seconds and just doing the quick google for 911. Yeah, just somebody going to, let me see what happened man. Yeah, yeah. um, and also though, there's other ones uh, because you further go, you back, further back you go, the more things get loose, uh, William Jennings Brian over Mckinley in 96, uh, do you see like populism, like develop as the response to Robert Baren capitalism, instead of you, middle-class led progressivism, which is what we ended up getting under Roosevelt, uh, maybe a brian presidency uh changes the contour. of that uh that political reshaping? yeah uh and then you know possibly leads to 20 25 years later a democratic party that's maybe more amable to the uh European style like socialist parties you know yeah who knows i how how does how does it sharpen the basically the question for anything really coming between the civil war and and uh the early 30s is how what could be different that could have sharpened the conflict? between labor and capital once the crisis occurs in the late 20s, early 30s, see I saw it, that that's oh yeah, oh, oh, in the late 20s, early 30s, because you think yeah, that's that's the moment, yeah, so you're so like, if you have a populism as opposed to progressivism that's that just ends up being assimilated into this, this uh republican hegemoneny in the 20s, uh, maybe you get something uh more more radically based, less less grounded in the... class that is than what we got, so yeah, i'd say Brian over Mckinley and uh, also uh, and this was a close one, which sadly the Mckinley Brian election wasn't, so this one is tantalizing because it was a close one, uh, Henry Clay over, James K Polt in 18 44, uh, an election that came down to a few thousand votes in New York, uh, and I think we might. discuss this, but uh, yeah, ended up turning on a bunch of abolitions voting for the the liberty party in protest, instead of the wigs who were, if not anti-slavery, more resisted to slave uh, uh, interests than the democrats, uh, but they wanted to keep themselves pure, so yeah, the first, the Bernie Broes were the first spoilers, in a presidential election in that respect, because if you don't. have pulk i don't know if you have the mexican war. do you think you know? do you think Texas comes into the union under clay or at all? like or is it like is it just delayed or does texas country? these are significant questions that we don't know the answers uh because astoundingly when the wigs are finally given a popular mandate and actual control over government uh the guy dies. and is replaced by a dude who was not a wig in any sense, yes a guy who had no identification or buying with the wig program and was in fact the unalloyed sort of ind of the democratic party, he was mad, he was mad at jackson because jackson wasn't uh psychotically enough devoted to southern slave interests, that's why he didn't like Jackson, astounding that he was on the ticket, yes uh oh wait a minute, no that's yeah uh Yes, so I'm sorry, so we didn't get that, so we didn't get that that was the possibility, maybe he takes over for pulk uh and stops the slide towards uh regional conflict, who knows? I mean, he was the great compromiser, uh, but it is interesting, so in the world we did get, the closest thing we had to a clay presidency wasn't really that, it was uh, it was the harrison uh, van beeren election, right? in 1840, uh, because uh, he was offered the vice presidency, and he turned it down, uh, and that's what set the stage, so we never got like wig united governments, but I think it's interesting that the only time they had the chance is when democratic uh governance collapsed, and that has been the wig motto ever since, because I think you can kind of think see the modern democrats as sort of the close the analogy to the wigs of that era, right? like if we're in a pre-civil war era broadly speaking, and this were and the democrats and republicans are the wigs and democrats. all over again, then clearly the democrats are the wigs and the republicans are the democrats, right? uh, and they in this context, as in that era, they could only claim power when the the main the hegemonic party that uh, is uh, based in like the populist, the the center of like the white male population, basically, the white male electorate, the center, the party that gravitates towards that center of gravity, which was the democrats and is the republicans, is got a natural built in advantage at the at the electoral level, therefore is going to rule most of the time, it can only be defeated when it destroys itself, it it can never, there's there could be no, like there was during the new deal era coherent popular party that can win by promising things, because the wigs could only really promise, you know, internal improvements, which struck a lot of people as special interests, like you're just helping manufacturers, it's a bipartisan infrastructure bill, you know, yeah, yeah, like the the base of the wigs was in the west where everyone, no matter what they cared about slavery wanted more infrastructure to facilitate development, because that's what was going to make them all rich, because they were all fucking speculating on the land that only had value if the government gave it value through public investment. uh, I haven't checked the bipartisan infrastructure bill yet, uh, I don't know if there are any uh budget for canals in there, um, but I certainly hope that we get at least a few new miles of canal building uh, out of the uh fingers cross, yes, uh, maybe we can do one more, but uh, I don't want to go you know super long on this, um, maybe throw some... more questions in there, let me go to my list right here, because the last thing that I want to do on this stream uh, is uh, talk about what we're going to do next, uh, after this, yes, um, so if there are any last minute uh questions in here, throw them in, here's one that's incredibly silly, but I think is funny to imagine, like the contours of this, we have to set up a lot of like what ifs here, uh, but what if uh, Trump was president during Lincoln'. term, yeah, so I'm, I'm just imagining, I'm just imaging like um, somebody with his exact personality, it's it's so hard to to guess what this would mean, I guess what would happen is like you, you forget all the previous things, Trump has just won the election and it's 1860 and the uh, the southern states are are succeeding, it's just funny to imagine because he he would' consider those his people, but they're succeeding and that makes him look like a loser, so how would you uh, how would you go about navigating this up? well, you could argue that that was jackson's bind during the nullification crisis, jackson who is of course you know trump's idol because he is the the farsical version of Jackson's tragedy right, right? uh, he had his people get mad at uh, um, tariffs that were the product of the democratic process. that was represented the pretty much united interests of eastern capital, which is significant, so it could not be, it could not be uh ignore, uh, and they resisted, but Jackson from the position of the center and as being a nationalist and as identifying himself with a nation, was like, fuck you, I will, I will hang my own vice president from a goddamn lamp post, uh, and it was, that was, by the way, that was the incident. that led John Tyler to become an anti-jaxonian, because he wasn't assiduous enough to southern regional interests, and you imagine that makes me think in a similar. situation Trump would do the same thing, but like in 1860 when they're already succeeding, he's such a pussy, yes, that I think he just would have let him go, uh, and then hope they were nice to him, or maybe ask to be uh in charge of them, that's like here's the thing, bear out, the election of Lincoln is what led to the secession, I know, the question doesn't make any sense, it's just funny to imagine him dealing with a a uh a crisis of that magnitude, you know. he would not, he would not have held up to it, like what about cuban missile crisis, how about that? oh, that's now, that's put your fucking, put your mind around that one, i get, i think apocalypse situation, i i god, that's really tough, i i think he lets cuba have them and then just tries to talk it out in the press, let lets the soviet union uh set up, the thing is though is that he is such a bullshitter, yeah, and he is so erratic. that you can't assure, you can't assume that something he says doesn't like spook the Soviets. I know the Soviets would never launch a first strike, but I could see Trump doing trying to do something like tactical to scare them or something, and then triggering a full a full exchange, because remember, the options in front of Kennedy after the revelation of the uh missiles were. it were the the the boycott or I'm sorry the uh the fuck what do you call it the the blocade the blockade the blocade wasn't even on the agenda it was it was basically what kind of invasion do we want to do do we want to do a full invasion or just we just want to bomb them and it was Kennedy who sort of pushed against that and said what if we did this third option that they all thought was Munich that's what Le thought, he said, this is Munich, uh, the quarantine is also what they call it, uh, and I don't think you get those options in front of Trump, he he thinks embargo, I don't think that he gets to that level of abstraction to even have that thought, and since there's nobody in the room giving him that as an option, he's gonna bomb something, because he's not created, yes, you know, with this stuff, he does, he did for his entire presidency, what? was presented to him as an option right, and whenever he went against that, it was just out of personal ego-based peak having to do with him, not having to do with policy, policy, he was totally frozen, that guy basically uh punked him out into killing sulimani, he said uh, you're going to go down as a you're gonna get a bunch of people killed, people are going to think you're a loser if you don't kill solamani and so he's like, i'll show you, and so he pressed the button, if you got Curtis Lamai in the room telling oh my god see if you don't fucking uh at least invade with a ground force Cuba, you got Vietnam, at the least you got Vietnam five years early in the Caribbean, here which by the way, I also think you would have gotten if Nixon and one in 60, which was a very close possibility, um, imagining Leme as one of the Trump guys, I think the easy impulse to say would be that that Leme would just be running the show because he's a big tough general and and uh you know Trump would be like he's a big. guy, I like, he's a tough guy, I like him, but but I think Lime is too strong of a personality and would have been one of the guys who's in there for like nine months and then crossed Trump on some kind, well that's for sure, no, it's only a question of whether he would have been able to get him in the room, but eventually anybody who is alpha, he has to get rid of because he's insecure, um, all right, let's do one more quick uh, what if, this is not going to be probably not going to be quick quick, but we'll do one more what if and then we'll talk about the next project and then we're going to get out of here, um, which elected postus would have been the most interesting to see die or resign and have their vp takeover for the full term? ooh, well, i mean obviously right off the dome, henry wallets in in like if if uh, if FDR died a few seconds earlier, before you few years earlier uh before you get into this, I do have to thank uh big bargaining unit energy for pointing out that 9.5 billion uh for inland waterways uh and the bistructure inlandville, so canals folks, we're bringing them back, folks, we're bringing back the canals, i start referring to uh biden as a neo wig, yeah he's basically a new wig, wiggle wiggle, what uh, all right, so most, so yes, so uh, fdr dying in his third term, yeah, absolutely, uh, that's a fascinating one, um, we talked about this on shampoo, but uh, hw taking over for Reagan is fast. just because so much of Reagan's ability to assimilate people to the reality of you, a new economic order. and a new uh destruction of the uh entitlements of American citizenship was personality based and narrative-based and the sort of the un alloyed exoskeleton of George Hw Bush carrying that stuff out is maybe a little less amentable to people who knows yeah uh let me think of another one I can think of an interesting reversal of this is if Mckinley doesn't get plugged and uh and Teddy doesn't uh ascend at that. young age uh from that position because again he about like you again i was just going to say because again he was put put in the vice presidency to uh to derail his political career you know so um yeah you know it would probably just be more republican business as usual it's funny to imagine shany taking over for Bush after 911 yeah once again a thing where like a lizard face carrying out this thing instead of uh bluff-hearty uh dimwit that everybody feels like they can have a beer with. um, yeah, what it would have been more difficult to sell the uh, if Bush had died in 911, like if they if he had been in the wrong place and you know uh, they actually like struck the white house or something, um, you know, and Chany got in there, would he have been able to sell the Iraq war as as well as Bush could have, you know, a real, a real what is. and and the one that is uh the basis for, I believe is the basis for the alternative Nazis Win World War II chronology in Dicks and man in the high castle is if Josepi Zangara kills FDR in uh Miami instead of uh killing the mayor of Chicago Anton Stermat and because then the new deal would have been presided over by Cactus Jack Garner the... uh former speaker of the house from Texas who was a uh fully uh patched in leader of the Burban Democrats, he was one of the reactionary uh right-wingers within the Democratic coalition uh and he spent the entire his entire two turns screaming about the new deal and he uh only served that long because he assumed that he'd be able to run for the office himself and and be president in uh after two terms and it FDR broke tradition in part because they didn't want to give the thing over to this guy because he would have basically sabotaged the new deal consciously and unconsciously uh and there was nobody else who could really be trusted to hold up the banner for the the project itself against its vice president. so uh they had he had to run for a third term, but having garner respond to the new deal or respond to the great depression, uh, you could have a much deeper great depression, you could have a more politically fractious one, a more violent one in all ways, and then a completely different response to the emergence of world war ii, and that's why uh, for Dick it led to the nazi's winning, because we would just not be able to get shit together, yeah, well, I think that's enough um, president's questions uh, for now uh, I would just say because you know this will be the last time that Matt and I will be talking about the presidents for a while, although I'm sure it will come up in uh other things, uh, you know, thanks, thanks again for everybody who listen, thanks, thank you for listening, really, glad everyone liked it, I was very, very worried about it, I think it turned out pretty good, that's mostly though, I must say due to Chris, if it would have been up to me, it would have been the... complete disaster, well, I absolute, for sure, absolutely could not have done it without Matt, uh, yeah, I think we were both very nervous about uh getting this out there and if it would uh make sense or be legible or be entertaining or engaging to everyone, so everyone to listened and everybody said nice things about it to us uh, of all the projects that we've done shaver related, this is the one that we're hearing nice things uh from the fans that was the most uh encouraging because it it let us know that we were on the right track and that you know because we were still producing the series even after the beginning of it started coming out still recording episodes so um yes that was very encouraging towards the end and i you know i think it it gave us the uh the the boost and and the confidence to as i was saying earlier those those last few episodes the latter half of the 20th 21st century uh you know when it the whole thing was getting pretty unwield you know hearing that what we were doing was working for people you know i think helped us at least me keep going and and and pushing through and and like staying on track to get the show done. so thank you everybody for listening um and then we'll use that to segway into that we want to do another one of these uh obviously it will not be hell of presidents or... hell of anything because that pun is specific to us presidents, but it will be me and Matt doing some kind of limited series that uh covers a specific chunk of time in a discrete way, and i you'm hesitant to talk about things because i tend in the past to be like, the more I talk about something publicly, the less likely it'll be to happen, but I think having done this once and uh, saying this here now publicly is more of a promise uh to you guys than uh bragging about something that hasn't happened yet. so we want to confirm now that we want to do something sometime next year uh on the 30 years war. yes, the uh, the 30 years war and the the 17th century transition uh towards capitalism that sees, and the the real end of the story is is how do you get, the real point of the story is to explain precisely how you get basically from the black death to the glorious revolution, the uh the hannivarian uh takeover of the UK that leads to uh anglo-capitalism to run rough shot over the fucking planet yeah this we want to kind of pitch it as the story of uh the the exo the t100 of capitalism emerging from the uh the rotting dead corps of feudal Europe uh through century of violence uh this century of uh empires forming and falling uh and most important through through this century or this 30-year conflict of uh german guys waving hawwards at each other. it's very important and the the whole time this is happening you're seeing a cultural revolution emerge simultaneously in order to absorb this change. yes, like these new conditions are going to require a new uh spiritual cultural understanding to uh metabolize them and the the thing that's emerging at the same time separate from the capitalist development, but uh on a parallel track is the reformation, right? and the emergence of protestantism, and all that's gonna, so we're going to go together, and then you have a century of conflict that the center piece of which is this horrifying 30-year period when central Europe was completely desolated, a greater, the greatest trauma in German history, even according to Germans, greater. World War II in their own memory anyway because you know it's persisted longer. Yes uh and we get to talk about yeah so we get to talk about like the the political uh formulations of Central Europe at the time which is very fascinating and funny. I mean the the holy Roman empire as a historical concept is fucking hilarious. It is basically uh the political economic equivalent of one of those uh carnival callapies with like. five million pipes and like a bunch of there's like a drama attached to it and the whistle things like the thing i think you should leave that uh think you should leave the thing that fred willard plays like that is the that is what the holy roman empire was uh to the person who suggested peace of west fail believe me i've already thought about that for a name oh yeah no that's on the list for sure um so yeah it's definitely going to be it's going to be a little more difficult than this because as we said in the the final episode when we were doing the ranking is the thing about the presidents is you get 46 of these guys and it's a discrete number and you can kind of go through and you can chunk them out and and it's a manageable thing. i think the task here is going to be one of ordering things especially because as Matt says we're probably going to try to start um you know start with Martin Luther and and william of orange uh so we're really looking at like a 200 year span of things with a focus on the uh the the a real focus in on the conflict but we got to go back far and we got to go forward far um and it's like that's the climactic thing of it yeah because it's the it's it's the end of the 30 years war and the treaty of was failia that uh establish the incapacity of any one power to rule Europe and the and it establishes the nation state as like the competitive uh uh the competitive state structure that is going to dominate the continent and then set a and then set that conflict into motion uh and so you essentially get uh a a competition for resources specifically imperial resources uh that leads to the uh adaption in the boggy fuck hole of Europe on the British Isles and low countries of a new form of uh social relations that facilitates uh uh economic growth facilitates therefore military and state power right and then is able to force on the rest of the world on on good or bad terms depending on on the ruling classes that exist there, this new system uh, and then I will also get to reshare my uh photo um of actually visiting the room where the guys get depenestrated from uh that where the definition of Prague happened uh, we love it, we love to defend it straight, don't we folks, out uh windows, um, my favorite thing about that is that it wasn't the first one, yes, it's the more, it's the one everyone remembers, but they didn't do first, we'll talk about the first one too, because that's part of the the story of uh reformation, yeah, um, so yeah, that's the, that's the new project, it's going to be a while because we started like outlining hell of presidents in like july of 20 20, uh, so it took us a long time to get from outline to um, to starting to record, um, but we've now already done this once, i think we're feeling a little better about it, i mean i've got, i've got the reading right behind me, so yeah, we're moving straight into it, um, i don't know, q3, q4, uh, 202, that's a good estimate, yeah, yeah, um, and you know uh, keep, keep us honest, keep on uh messaging me periodically, hey when's uh, when's the 30 years war, we'll keep you uh, we'll keep you posted on progress, um, but yeah, so that's the that's series two of this, and that will uh, um, that will be on patreon, that will be a uh like we're doing with hinch points, which the new hinge points should have just dropped about 23 minutes ago, um, that one is going back to the civil war, new hinch points on um, you know the pretty well well-trad territory for matheads, the uh the the Johnson uh benjamin butler uh what we had to do it too important um so like hinch points uh the next series will be um on patreon i can also tease right now that um hell why not uh february 4th i believe is locked in for the next season of this is sus coming back on uh on patreon as well we're going to be putting these series up throughout the year um hopefully there'll be a few of these um so yeah uh good teeses all around uh anything else that you want to say matt uh not much uh thank you really for everybody. you enjoyed it, it was really cool, and uh, I'm, I'm looking forward to more uh nerdery, it's just, it's good to know that there are people who uh, care at all about this shit, which makes me feel like I've less like I wasted all of my life, uh, same, um, to to to get a little sappy for a second, uh, you know, I spent a long time in the content minds for uh places where nobody watched or listened to anything that I produced uh at the media companies I worked at so uh making things for people who actually uh like and listen to and enjoy it and get something out of it is uh you know it's been it's been the greatest uh honor and privilege of my life so uh thank you all listeners for this project and we'll be back soon uh with more cool shit uh and until then um i don't know uh listen to the show again i was going to try to come up with a president's pun but uh i i got nothing um yeah me either all right the presidents we love them folks uh we love um think about them never again uh instantly deleting all the knowledge of the presidents in my mind uh forever bye bye.
