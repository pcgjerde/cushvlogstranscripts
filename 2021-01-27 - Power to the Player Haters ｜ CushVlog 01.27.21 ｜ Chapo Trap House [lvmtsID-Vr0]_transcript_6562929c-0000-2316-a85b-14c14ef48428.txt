 particle man, particle man, doing the things a particle can, what's he like, it's not important for them, is he a dog or is he aspect, he gets water is he gets, was the water get him instead, nobody knows, trying man, triangle man, triangle man, triangle man, hates particle man, they have a f triangle wins, triangle man, universe man, universe man, size of the entire universe man, usually kind a smaller man, powerful man, universe man, i think there needs to be a rule about people talking about the gamestop deal, the whole reddit revolt, against wall street, if you can't explain the ending of trading places, you cannot talk about it, you cannot have an opinion and you sure shit cannot publicly express an opinion, and how dare you if you fucking try, now I will say about myself that I know a little bit about a lot of the things, more basically the skill of a conversationalist, the ability to to have a... about something, but not to really understand it or and provide insight about it, and then I know a decent amount about a few things, uh, and then there's a lot of stuff that I don't anything about, where I wouldn't even feel comfortable bullshitting, and the fucking stock market is one of them. I am a congenital peasant. Uh, the one thing though that I will say with confidence, definitively, is that this... will not lead to some sort of uh proletarization of finance, this will not bring down the overlords of wall street, uh, this is essentially somebody counting cards at the casino, and you can count cards at the casino for a while, but eventually if they find out that's what they're doing, they just kick you out, and there's nothing you can do about it, because it's a private preenterprise, and they can they can decide who gets to go in or not, and they say, get out of here, and so whatever is happening now, one, the vast majority. the money that's being made is being made by the demon class, not by reditors, that's what's facilitating all of this, that's where the money is really going, high frequency trading and the like, and two that if it does provide any like destabilizing element, that will be fixed, they will solve it, they've already put a 30-day ban at td price uh on trading some of these stocks, apparently water robinhood is down, they're going to just change the rule. because they're the house, some of these guys individually might lose some money here, but once the this uh leak in the system, leak in them the the ship is identified, they're going to patch that motherfucker, they're going to put some of their water seal on there, has anyone seen the commercial for uh this um, it's a super sealent that you could use to patch like you could make a boat out of it, they did that in a commercial and the guy who does the ad like the billy maze rip to a real one uh uh hype man is the most philadelphia accented man on earth and he just says the whole time is the water seal watch the flex seal that's it flex seal there water's never going to get in there we're never look at the water water is not getting in here or there cuz a flex seal they're going to slap that fucking flex seal on there and that water is not going anywhere because they are in charge this is the house that's the one thing i know that's a great i accent shut up wooder ice the the watching though every like every doomed business model, every like jurassic uh web 1.0 ass 20th century like buggy whip ass place that is just been like has a target on its back for the last 30 years and it's now a joke like gamestop and blockbuster build a bear workshop and not obviously you know new to the list but a very late and dramatic edition AMC theaters uh just watching them one by one get picked up, it really is like irony has taken, we have an irony based economy now, and some people, some regular folks are going to make money out of this for sure, some regular old reditors are really going to make their nugggies off of it, and if they do, god bless them a lot of them are going to end up losing money though, and it'll eventually be uh sorted. the the the bug will be found in the code and removed, flexial fixes the water. so I would say if anybody's making money cool, but for the love of God, walk away from, no one to walk away from the fucking table, you never count your money when you're sitting on the country, but like just hit the button, hit the button and get out of there when you still can't, buse there's no way anybody who is not who is not suffed at lord Epsteen's table if you know what I mean is going to get any of this real money. on a lone summer's even on a train bound for nowhere, i met up with a gambler, we are both too tired to speak, and waiting finished speaking, turn back toward the window, no that's the end, never mind, all right, so uh, i want to post, you can only talk about the gamestop thing. If you can explain the ending of trading places correctly. All right, I'm only saying this because I always kind of have felt like I kind of get the ending of trading places and I will now try to explain what I think happened at the end of trading places and you guys can tell but from that how far I am from being able to talk about this stuff like how about that as the rule um cuuse I'm sure somebody in here has enough experience with stock markets or... film itself to be able to explain to me if I'm right or wrong, and if I get a bunch of conflicting answers then I will uh assume I'm right and that you are all just either trolling me or bullshitting. So we know at the end of trading places uh Eddie Murphy and Dan accroid have intercepted the crop report that the uh that Clarence Beaks was going to give to the Duke Brothers which was going to say how Florida's orange crop had gone. Now if and by the... wait, let me just say this a parenthetical, as as a someone watches movies that are made in 2020, 20, 2020 and 2021 now, for a popular audience, the degree to which trading places which starty murphy and what was a big movie and was expected to have a mainstream audience, the degree to which it does not explain almost anything about how that stock shit stock shit works, it just assumes that you understand it is kind of amazing. like the central premise that the Duke Brothers can corner the frozen orange juice market as long as they know ahead of time that there will be a reduced number of oranges and therefore the price will go up because of a shortage like you have to know that and it's never really explained in the text and then the ending is completely unexplained I really wonder I mean I guess it just speaks to like the charisma of those two guys and how much people loved them at the time and you know of course Jamie Lee Curtis's Boobs that people. just like allowed that to just go over their head, whereas now everyone is so obsessed with understanding movies and our understanding of movies and our criticisms of movies basically come down to whether or not we think the plot makes sense having nothing to do with like the characters or the tone or the performances or if it's funny it doesn't make sense so everything has to be spelled out for you like you're a baby it's kind of astounding like i just i don't know what a young person whose weened on baby food movies does seeing trading places and as i said trading places is not a fucking like It's not a genius film, it's a John Landis uh uh 80s uh knuckle head fest all right so the duke the the first we have the reality there was no damage to the crops they're going to have a lot of oranges which means that if you knew that ahead of time you'll know that the price is likely to go down so they know that but they give to the dukes a fake report saying that the crop has been damaged significantly, which means that the price is going to go way up, so they send their boy to the uh commodities exchange in Chicago, I think because they take a train, I think the the commodities exchange is in Chicago, not New York, I think a lot of people assume that the end of that movie is in New York, I'm pretty sure it's in Chicago, right? Am I wrong, because the place they go in um, in ferrisbuler. they i mean they're in philadelphia originally you know like the duke brothers are in philadelphia and they take a train at the end of the movie to like that's when they get the money from uh colman they go on a train from chicago and they never sell you where to it they it's amazing and i think a lot of people assume it's to the stock exchange it's not it's to the commodities exchange in Chicago and Coleman tells them my life saving sir please don't lose it all and they don't explain what to what they want him to do with it they never say like a movie would now thanks Colman, we're going to take that and buy a bunch of orange juice futures now before the the the trading starts tomorrow. They don't say that, they don't tell you that they go into the thing with orange juice. futures that they already own them, and then when the dukes start buying to corner and other people see them buying to corner, they all bid the stock up or the the price up before the announcement, now of course they don't want that to happen, but a little bit of it is is necessary, like when you when you fix a fight, you're not going to get all of the odds, because the fact that you put a bunch of money on that side is going to get a few people to go with you and it's gonna It's gonna um inherently limited a little bit and like that's acceptable, but then what happens is when they find out what happened with the orange juice, oranges, oh no, there's tons of oranges, the prices that no one's gonna fucking buy uh oranges for this much, there's no way people are going to buy oranges for this site price because there's so many oranges, and that means everyone needed to sell, oh I forgot, well they were buying when it got to the top. uh dan acroid and Eddie Murphy sell all there, so they buy it, they buy, they sell off and get the cash from this huge sale of all of the all of the orange juice they bought the day before, and then after it crashes back down, they buy them back, and then the difference between that is all the money they made and how they get on the yacht and they get the lobsters and crack crab for dinner, and then the fact that the dukes were on the other side of all of that trading meant that they lost all that money. because they were doing it on margin and that means that it would it's all on the assumption that you're not going to have to pay it back until you do and then they're ruined. is that correct? it's 80's cinema, thank you, not 90s. i got it. what's so amazing is how much of that is not in the movie at all, like not only do you have to kind of understand commodities trading and the stock market? you have to understand the story through. doesn't tell them that they are buying them early, they don't say that they are holding them when the trading starts, just narratively it's astounding that they wouldn't add that, like that's extra stuff that i had to add to make it makes sense, and i'm hoping that that is correct, because remember these are futures, so what they're basically doing is they're betting on what people in the future will pay for frozen orange juice, and damaged crops in florida means they'll pay a lot for it, uh, bountiful crop in florida means they'll pay less for it. it's not bad writing, it's it's it trusts its audience because none of that stuff is dramatically necessary or funny, it's exposition, it's unnecessary exposition, if you can just do some job work as a fucking viewer and connect the dots yourself, instead of having them baby food formulas speed, feed into your fucking mouth. they've turned us all into Terry Shivos, just getting nutrient sludge of exposition and plot stuff fed into us, how many movies have you seen that came on the last fucking 10 years? I would like to see a chart of how often the phrase, as you know has been uttered in films over the years, and I have a feeling it's gone up recently, because that dialogue, when a character says to another, as you know, everything that comes after should not be in a movie, it's absurd, these people would not say this to each other, it's going to be totally... uh dramatically inert, this is not a conversation that people would happen, because they already know this, you have to show them through other means, there is no patience, there is no expectation that an audience will have the patience to do that, it's not their fault, they're not dumber, it's more than anything to do with attention spans and the way that we fucking interact with entertainment essentially as we're watching it, in a way that we didn't used to, we used to give things our full attention, not because we were more virtuous, but because there were less. fewer distractions, that's it, and so I say, how dare you to anyone who says that's bad writing, because if I'm right and you're telling me I got it right, that's all in the movie, I didn't have to go to wikipedia, I just took my understanding, alayen's understanding of uh commodities markets and and stocks and shit, and applied it to the text, and I assume the stuff that was there, but it wasn't there, and boom, it's there, all right, they do explain that, yeah, they explain how... the commodities thing works, but everything else about the end of it, you have to intuit, like the fact that they bought early and that they're selling it again, at or they're buying it at one, they bought, they're they're selling at the beginning stuff they already bought, and then they're buying it back at the end, so all right, cool, I understand the end of trading places, then i get to talk about it, but I will still limit myself. to what I have any confidence saying, which is one, I'm not going to do it because I guarantee you I would lose my goddamn shirt. I am a German peasant, through and through, I am a good time party German, not. for numbers, it's not what we were there for, the Germans, they had protoc, they had protocapitalism as early as uh, they had the they had protocapitalism in Europe before the Dutch or the English, around the same time as uh, the Italians and like the Italians they couldn't hold it together, buse they just like uh, they like having too much fun, they like partying, I'm sorry, uh, they're not shivering their ass off in the bogs and fens. and fucking mores and and living in literal lagoons, prussians are engineers, prussians are like Romans, like it's all about engineering, it's not really about uh, about like manipulating finance, which requires a degree of imagination that isn't really part and parcel of that mindset. yeah, prussians are artillery man, prussians, they're bridge builders. like the Romans, um, anyway, and no background in it, family, i i come from that um, the the people who came to the mid-west to farm and then eventually settled into moved into cities to get jobs and then thanks to the larges of the federal government through the new deal uh, and uh, we're able to get home equity uh for cheap, that that's and then like without. having to uh gain like a advanced degree or to hold capital and so not a lot of stocks trading any of that stuff pensions that's your number one source of like uh finance capital that you're going to have access to and of course the equity in your home so i don't fucking know anything about this stuff i'm not going to do it i'm not going to try to become a billionaire even though the idea like my god if i put if i just put a little bit of money i have a little bit. on that at the early stages, i would literally be a millionaire right now and i could become the joker, which is the only reason anyone should want to be a millionaire is to become the joker, and instead i'm not, but it's like no no, if i had done it, i would have done it in such a way that i would have fucked it up, i have i said this on last chapo, but i've done several parley bets where i try to do, i'm going hey, i don't like a bett a bunch of money, but i'd like to make a bunch of money and sports betting you can't you. you don't really have that kind of uh layout, you know, like if you bet uh, if you bet on like small differences, you kind of have to bett a lot to get any to make it worth your while, unless the odds are good, and then you know you need to know uh, and so that's where you put in your prognosticating, and every time I've done it, not only have I done a parley bet or every time I've done a parley football bet, which is where you bet like 10, 20 bucks or whatever on the outcome of three or more games or... stuff and uncut gens, those are parley bets, and like if any one of them doesn't work, the whole thing, the tickets uh uh validated, but if they all work, you get many more than the like if you bet them individually, like the the odds, and every time I've done it, not only have I failed it, I got every one wrong, meaning that if I had bet the opposite, if I had hedged my bets by betting my exact opposite, I would have made a bunch of money, I have no instinct for it, uh, I like playing poker, but I'm a bad poker. player because i worry about the money too much, it gets in my head, i i just have never been able, maybe i could apply my renewed zen, i haven't played uh sports, i haven't played uh, i haven't gambled in a while so and when i had and so i'm pretty rusty, i don't know, i like the idea of gambling, but i'm just too sweaty about it and i think i would be too sweaty about doing any of this stock shit, so i'm not going to do it as one thing i know, the other thing i know is it's going to end up fattening the the the the goats of the same goat sucking scumbags who are in charge of us and that uh if there is any government response it will be to make sure that the one thing that happens is regular people are not allowed to do this anymore because the whole point of this and the whole point of you know what literally the point of us uh fiscal policy since the civil war when we decided to establish a gold standard when we decided to say hey buse they'd opened the the the United States opened the genie uh or opened the the Pandora's box rub the lamp whatever you want to say whatever metaphor you want to use they opened Pandora's box of uh find of um of fiot currency during the civil war because it just wasn't enough species around specie around to fund an army and so the US for the first time published from a central not from like local banks from the central government published issued currency, they were called green banks and they were backed by the bayonet of the fucking grand army of the republic, that was it, which of course is always the case. with money, it all ends up poiling down to the confidence of the institution that is presiding over the transaction that uses it, that is, that is what backs all currency, everything else is a abstraction to mystify that relationship, because the more aware people are of that fact, the more dangerous democratic institutions are to existing power structures, and the people say MMT, it is MMT, but the problem with MMT is. that it is right, but beside the point, it's georgism for the 21st century, you will not convince people to socialism, you will not convince people not based on class interests, but based on truthness of a theory to change things, material interest is the only thing that will do it, it cannot be theoretical, so yeah, MMT is correct, I want to accept that it is a accurate description of how money works, that, I'm sorry, I don't know what else I'm supposed to do with this, tell everybody about it, yes, people are dying to talk about this shit, people are dying to have conversations about what really backs up the monetary supply, just like they're dying to have discussions about cancel culture and fucking uh, whether acab is um, insufficiently radical or whatever the fuck, whatever arguments we're all having on here, the ones that all the people who really matter to this equation are not having, you're going to start with this shit? having around good, but evangelizing it, which seems to be the point, seems to be to be just, it's it's the same sort of liberal uh socialism uh that Henry George invented, like i i've thought for a long time from my first really heard about it is MMT is the is the return of Georgism, only it's even it has even less popular support than that, cuz Georgism actually did have significant um uh appeal. electorally among the working class, the Henry George made an amazing showing as running as mayor of New York against uh Tamini and the republicans uh on a labor platform and people expousing Georgesm made inroads in the populist party uh and made up members of the nights of labor and I mean it was actually persuasive at the grassroots this is shit you talk about on Twitter this is meme politics even if it's true. so anyway, to get back to the point, so they had exposed the naked raw nerve, they've exposed the bone of money at the civil war, and they needed to to defeat the fucking rebellion, they needed to summon the yankey leviatin, even though they were all all the rulers anyway, it's not like they were completely opposed to the uh like liberal uh ident like um identity concept that the jeffersonians who ended up creating their mutant like calhoonite confederate uh society, it's not like they didn't share their liberalism, their essential liberalism, their idea of like property being liberty and lot property being inaliable by politics and that any politics that threatens the uh to make property aliable is by definition uh evil, they believed that that was and in the republic in the... that in the south that was an articulation that came from the jacksonian democrats, in the north it really was the wig party, before the civil war you could really say that even though the democrats were the naturally hegemonic party in power at any given time in congress, thanks to federalism by the civil war, you essentially the war you had uh uh what what essentially happened is that the conflict that immediately emerged between uh the federalists and the the Jeffersonian Republicans at the beginning of the foundation of the republic that we had a series of compromises that maintained a political consensus government that existed, but in at the level of political economy, what they basic, the way they resolved that problem, the way that the constitutional compromise resolved the problem was essentially to say through the mechanism of the states, you guys build your political economy along Jefferson lines and will build ours along Hamiltonian lines and by the end by the civil war you have a battle between the the uh the wigs by that point like the wig uh American idea that came from clay uh and was articulated finally and fully by Lincoln Lincoln who was a wig before he was a republican and idalized Henry Clay. The south was governed by people uh at the state level who had come from that Jefferson. small radical small government hostility to central banking and taxation power and expansion of federal money and the war happened because these things became unresolvable at the political level because political level, it was always a situation of kicking the can down the road until the material conflict between the two regimes became insurmontable, which is what western expansion did, it made those insurmontable and it made the political system no longer able to accommodate it, that in a nutshell is the civil war, what what made it happen? and uh, so what the uh northern wigs had to do was create this federal machine, and they didn't want. to do it, they did what they had to do to survive, but those guys believed in the centrality of property and it's uh it's equation to liberty, and that meant that they could not allow a situation where um that the mob, the demos could actually distribute resources to emerge, they had to keep control of the money, and so after a big of number of series of debates and arguments and splits between parties and within parties, there was a consensus to move to the gold standard, and grant started that movement, it took a number of years because they had to like, one of the big reasons that the period between the civil war and world war 1 is so economically stagnat is that for most of it you had this deflation, first they were literally taking money out of circulation to equalize with gold, and then they were just not ever putting in more liquidity whenever the economy would shiver to a halt, which happened all the fucking time uh and that's why that's why silver and and um liquidity like financial liquidity became the signal question of the moment and I would like to point out that if people want to understand why we're in a situation where Yahoos are breaking the capital and politics is a spectacle of of mind mindblowing insanity insane devotion to to cartoons to a figure like Donald Trump like think of this a game show host in inspires the sie and uh investment of the US capital, that happens in this country, and I know we can joke about it, but in American history, this is a a an insane thing that happened, this is a thing that even 10 years ago if you'd conceived of you wouldn't have been able to get your head around, if you really want to understand why that's happening, I would say take a look at a similar situation economically for Americans uh around the turn of this century uh when... we we're seeing the promise of American uh manifest destiny, small uh uh liberal republicanism, the the model that both Jefferson and Hamilton strove to, we're both moving towards in different with different methods because of different cultural conditions that were reinforcing and all that, it come a cropper, it had failed, it had failed the vast majority and there was this inser, there was a politics that embodied that... dissatisfaction and what was it its form? it was form was the candidacy of William Jennings Brian, the man who would not see us crucified upon a cross of gold, and his campaign was around the issue, basically the single issue of democratizing monetary flow in this country by giving by by essentially taking uh injecting liquidity at the bottom, that's what it boiled down to, and that is of course what democrat. control of the economy will produce, which is destabilizing for many reasons, and you can say it's bad too, because it like, it leads to waste and overproduction and overconsumption, and it's like, yes, if it's unmored to class struggle, if it's more to class struggle, it can actually be useful, and uh, and create genuine conflict like between uh, the democratic entity and the actual powers within a a social order, and and that... was the debate, we're in a similar situation now of our neoliberalized deal, our post, and in fact not even that, because we still think, we still imagine we're living in the fucking new deal era, we haven't even metabolized how much of that uh framework has been destroyed because we don't really remember it, but we still think in those terms, we still assume this level of uh of like socialization of of uh of wealth, distribution of wealth downward. and it's going away and we're seeing it fall apart in real time. what was the presidential debate about? what did the two parties argue about? was anyone saying anything? i mean, the for what was it? $2,00 checks, right? that's the closest thing. did any of them even talk about that during that campaign? did that motherfucker Trump who's supposed to be the fucking Jacob Coxy reborn, american populism on the march? tom, what would he do? he talked about how big shits were and how they couldn't go down the fucking toilet because that question 200 checks is already such a grotesque of democratic horizons on the question of the economy to go from we're going to go from having metal gold as our backing of currency to a bunch of silver to reverse the leverage relationship between debtors and creditors which was the driving force of populism was debt just like debt is the presiding fact of American life for most people. and what would we get, whether or not to get a check, and that wasn't even one of the things they actually talked about, in such a thing, when when politics is so restrained, but our lives are so bad, how are we not going to invest all of our energy in meaninglessness, in whether Trump is president, of course that's how our politics are going to be fucking organized at all levels, this is just an example. and of course there's social uh fractures that exist now that are recognized in politics in a way that they were buried by those politics, that's true, that's always the case, but it's our failures then that set us up for our failures now, it's just been one long slide, but anyway to try to get back to what i was originally trying to talk about, when they reasserted the gold standard. It was to make sure that control of uh where the money goes, investment is concentrated in these banking institutions that these people preside over, not in the hands of actual people, and that was the goal of post war monetary policy, to keep the money where it's going, cuz it was a giant continent that was just waiting to be invested in. to produce massive profits, yes, it was settler colonial expansion, genocidal expansion, of course, but to the people within it, it was not that, it was manifest destiny, and they were, they had the capacity within themselves to actually democratize, investment can't have it, and so in this current context, if this is like the the uh, that another one of those openings, one of those apertures, My god, maybe we could, maybe if it's maybe if the only thing we have is is market speculation, maybe if moving numbers around on a paper piece of paper is the only thing that generates fucking economic activity in this country, which it is, it's a totally financialized economy, it is all not speculation, it's it's a it's a minimal amount, it's a sluggish amount of real economy and trade on which has been stacked an infinite level of micro transactions and swaps and and counter swaps and not investing in the time it takes to get a thing from one place to another, not any of the actual production of it. if that's all we have, why, why, why can't everybody do that? why couldn't everybody be doing that, instead of it being funnel through Wall Street so that all of this money, all of the excess part, all of like the transactional element of it is instead of being concentrated there, distributed universally, not. equally, but closer to, and allowing people to invest in actual productive economy, maybe, around them, can't have it, can't have it, and so it's going to get the hook one way or the other, Yes, some, yes exactly, like the thing that generates economic activity right now is our collective consciousness, it is our memes, it is our culture, it is our anxieties, it's us, it is, we are just the brain in the jar, the body is the rest of the world working and toiling to bring us things, we're just supposed to think about them, we're supposed to interact with them synthetically, and interacting those thing with things, real things synthetically at the end of the fucking chain of uh of resource or of um, apply, that is the economy here, we are just the neurotic consciousness of the world economy, we exist to think about everything else that is being produced, to interact with it by buying and selling it, and talking about it, and spectaclizing it, and and turning it into social life, turning transaction into social life. and that's that's the actual state, that's what the American economy is, which means that it really could be democratized theoretically, but of course, how could it be done, it could only be insisted on from the bottom, but if it was insisted upon it would be, it would be uh resisted, and that resistance if it did not succeed would eventually become hostile and you would have class war. That's the thing that the MMTs and the Georgists and uh the the the cod Grampsians that think that you can march your way through institutions and then just flip them over, fail to get is that there will always be a point of maximum conflict, a point of genuine uh a point, a point in a conflict when a existential question emerges, if this conflict is... from the point of view of capital, there becomes a point where any further um, any further submission, because of course you will submit as much as possible, because coming to final conflict is no good, it's wasteful, but you'll only do it as much as you need to, and that changes depending on uh the the force of your opponent, like the new deal happened because capitalism had had to make a deal. It was not sustainable anymore in given how much popular organized opposition to it existed and so the new deal was it was set on the terms it was in advantage to the working class as you wanted to uh buy by the leverage the working class had in the situation when a new crisis emerged in the 70s that working class leverage had been completely hollowed out uh and it was like termite it was like they had a big seage engine just got eight by termites over 40 years. and those termites were prosperity, they demobilized the working class and turned their politics cultural, and so when it happened, it happened behind the scenes and there was nobody even there to press the point, and so we got this, if we get to another conflict point because things get worse and and that fat and happiness, that sedative of prosperity that we had been narconized with wears off, there will come another point of conflict, and within that you get a and within point where if capital gives up anything else it will ceas to have internal coherence and it will be vulnerable to actual threat and if that and that can't happen and so at that point real force is exerted and then the opponent the working class whatever you want to call it has to make the decision whether they can win that fight this is why i said if the german working which is all that we have, which is the brain stem of not just American, global capitalism, that they're going to democratize the system of that, it cannot be allowed, and no amount of convincing people about MMT will get you there, only class, organization and uh class mobilization and militancy will get you there, somebody's asking about Irish unification, i i i talked about it a while ago and said that while I think it's cool, I don't really think it's possible, but somebody dm me to say who's in Ireland and and and is following it closely and say this... thing could actually happen that it's not crazy to imagine a unified Ireland thanks to Brexit, which hey, what, wouldn't it be cool to have a big thing happen in the world that wasn't. just awful and depressing, wouldn't that be great, and especially if it's because the dup psychos were too psycho, and we're like, we can't just insist upon uh, like adhering um psychotically to the Great Britain, we have to outblimp the blimps in our devotion to some pig-headed national, economic nationalism that's totally you, lost its passed cell by date and then doubling down on it and then driving out all of the moderate uh reunionists just like in the exact same mirror way that our republican party is operating because the one place where uh reactionary politics are most similar to the United States is in Northern Ireland. The Irish unionist community there is the closest culturally uh politically. uh to ours of any right wing anywhere in the world, i would say, they are young earth creationist anti-abortion uh neoconfederate psychos, i saw when i was in Belfast, i went to uh the Shankel road, when i went to the chankel, i saw one of the huzonest states, they had a fucking james bukan and on the side of a building and of course all of the they had scotch irish generals of the confederacy, but of course what's what's sad is that our uh left politics could not be further from uh north northern irish left politics because we're all settlers, we're all olster scots, we're all presbiterian py blood drinking uh fucking psychos, none there's not a there's not an oppressed cropy to be found, even even the the most green son of Aaron to ever take a coffin ship from temporary to New York is a fucking uh is a Irish catholic, you are, you're a fucking hun, you're a goddamn orangemen, we're all orange men. Australia is pathetic because like the... clearly trying to be like us, they're like doing it on purpose, it's kind of self-conscious, but the dude the fucking the the northern irish uh or the the the fucking scotch irish psychopath snake handling maniacs, they're not doing it for anybody, they're not trying too hard, they're just trying, they're they're galvinized, they're not these fucking phony, like you're in Australia, what are you mad about? yeah, you're settlers, but like you banished your enemies to... fucking outer wastes and you get to just get shit faced and crush tinnies and flip flops 300 days a year until of course the place literally becomes uninhaverable in 20 years. no, no, no, no, the Canadian right wing, the American right wing are Australian right wing are cucked versions of America's right wing. honestly, America's right wing is a cucked version of the northern irish right wing. that's the real steel, the fucking - going to arrest the pope, i'm on fucking they were q and on before q and on, iann paisley tried to punch the pope at the European parliament, uh uh yeah did you guys ever that he had to be restrained of course it was like hold me back stuff but he actually like tried to do a citizen's arrest on the pope that is some marjerie taylor green shit John Paul for crimes against the people for didling all those kidsly please you John Paul the second under arrest yeah we're cucked versions of them man but no australian's Canada are cuck versions of us and uh the irish irish version of us is maybe the most cuck people on earth holy shit. can't hard to get more cucked than that, other than maybe like ukrainian nazis, holy shit, they literally almost destroyed your country, do any of those, of course they don't, they can't read, but uh, those ukrainian nazi should really take a look at uh, aust plan, which was Herman Guring's plan for Ukraine and eastern Europe after the war, which was to redirect agricultural uh output in such a way to essentially enslave. like 20% of the Ukrainian population and have the remaining number die of starvation, that was the nazi plan for your crane, you take the fucking holodormo, whatever degree to which that... was real and it was, there was mass death in Ukraine after Stalin took power, that's fact, what it was a combination of a bunch of factors def including bureaucratic incompetence uh uh and unnecessary violence, uh, national shovinism, all the evils of a colonial administration that was continued, even though there had been a change in government, because colonial administration is colonial administration, and Ukraine was a was a minority within the Russian empire, and then of course. so uh the main thing though was a genuine fucking famin which had cyclically hit that region throughout its generation until modern ecological technology changed that uh agricultural technology caught up and and changed that dynamic that was a and that was the main driver of it, but whatever degree the soviets were involved would have been a fucking drop in the bucket to what they were going to do to Ukraine if they won the war, they would have kept a few people to be basically like uh uh uh draft animals in little neocon feudal like village uh castle grounds, they were going to recreate medieval uh like the old, they were essentially trying to recreate the old teutonic knights domination of old Prussia, like that's what they were trying to recreate when when the when the when the uh when the teutonic Knights went from Jerusalem, got kicked out after the crusades had nowhere to go, didn't want to go home, had nowhere to go to... because they were all disinherited second sons, uh, they waged a holy war against the remaining uh, pagan population of eastern Prussia and Lithuania, and that crusade was very successful, and it led to the exerpation of the the of paganism, the replacement of it with catholicism, and they were the, it was essentially a confederation of like landed uh knights who had feudal estates where they had slave uh serfs and that would be what they were going to create in Ukraine, but it would have required way fewer hands than they wanted than uh, they way fewer hands and miles than it currently existed because they were going to intensify the surpluss and ship it all to Germany, and so the easiest way to deal with that is just to deprive them of. food, just take it from it, way more systematically than Stalin ever did, that was the plant, and it was, they didn't do it because they lost, and these fucking assholes are out there waving nazi flags, like I wish you guys had genocided me, cucked, but this is the thing, there is nothing to respect about about uh, any of these reactionary movements, there's no, the thing that people get caught up with a little bit, I think well-meaning people, honestly, you know ambiently racist white guys who might be persuaded to be more democratic or to be more egalitarian, but like are are just driven by their cultural context to you, respond to this kind of stuff. uh, the thing that is romantic about it, and that speaks to people in a way that the left shit doesn't, is that rootedness, is that feudal sense of a social reality that transcended the market, and that no politics which all. politics are, which is multinational, multiracial, egalitarian, can maintain those local rooted things, because things like race and class, race hierarchy, race, racial awareness, racial distinction, those things are part and parcel to those local regimes of control, and they are the things that people respond to through the echos of history, and they see the left and they see nothing there that can maintain those things and in fact. is that all remaining bonds be dissolved, but that's the degree to which i can sympathize with any right-winger comes to the right through that, through that reasoning, and some i will, i will refently say that that is an appeal that exists and i think that the question of who those people are and how to talk to them is one of the central ones that is dominated like the neurotic online left, because so many people who are online are these people, are these you know highly alienated, but a culture white man, those are the people who do have the time to sit on the internet are alienated enough to want to spend their time doing that, and so they are considered up for grabs. of course, the fact that they don't really stand in for any greater number of people and they stand in for people by and large are least connected to the productive economy which needs to organize before anybody else in order to really challenge capitalism, that they are essentially irrelevant, like we're talking fail sons, nets and people who have office clicky clack jobs or fake jobs and those people no matter. how much they feel real and feel like the sum total of like the political consciousness in this movie in this country, they are self-selected, and they are disconnected from the people who have made the conscious choice or... unconscious choice to realize politics is bullshit and they just need to live their lives, which is the majority of people who are closer to the bone who have less time to sit around and worry either behind the desk at work or behind the desk at home looking at a computer either way, they're online either way, they're whether they have a job or the unemployed, whether they in the PMC or the whatever, they're they're somewhere there, and of course this isn't all of them, plenty of these people have like real jobs, but their social milieu is going online to post about politics. but the problem with that reasoning, the flaw in it, the reason that I cannot countenance the right on any terms even its most romantically, pre-capitalist is that that doesn't exist anymore, man, that's gone, it's all like salazar's regime that was built on top of a literal like the wreckage of a failed modernism, like Portugal was one of those countries that tried to keep up with the capitalism and fucking like tripped and bell on their fucking face three steps out honestly cuz it's too nice, it's too nice in Portugal, why do you want to sit in account house fucking looking at coins all day like some dutchman who lives in a fucking bog, you're in lisbon for god sakes, drink some fucking madera, and so they tripped out of the gates, uh uh, smashed their fucking face in and we're basically living in the ruins of feudalism, oh yeah, you we can create some sort of integralis thing, even though of course it wasn't even true, the guy's article is bullshit, they had fucking concentrate. camps, they tortured and murdered communists all the time, they were insanely repressive, and they were raged colonial wars on a massive scale, which he also doesn't talk about, but anyway, now that's gone, man, there's nothing, you would be building from the rubble of American liberalism into your imagined like uh, embedded social organism that can like achieve homeostasis with its natural environment instead of being constant conflict with it, it does not exist, it's a bunch of boat owners and not just boat owners uh watchers, it's a bunch of, it is these deculturized, atomized consumers, fully stripped beings, who do not have any shared anything beyond their understanding of culture and identity through spectacal, and then wiring it through their personal desires, not through any alienated sense of spiritual connection to anyone outside of themselves, all of our ideas about religion and place and all these things that are going to that supposedly are going to hold us together against the storm of neoliberalism, they are on the they are all embedded in the uh the quick sand of atomized neoliberal subjectivity, no matter what these people think when when the when they these guys imagine these ideas, these rooting concepts, they imagine them being the thing that transcends selfishness, because what is the question of politics right now on the left and right, then how do we fill, how do, what we have essentially realized everywhere is that if we just let uh self-interest govern things through a network of you know facilitation of transaction, selfishness will drive us to destruction, because the all we will alienate ourselves from each other every day and the only thing that will be able to fill the space will be consumption and that... is incompatible with the fucking limited biome and it's it's just incompatible with with the second law of thermodynamics for fuck's sake and we have to put some fucking pressure on the gears we have to fucking tap on the brakes here collectively and there's a bunch of ways people say to do that uh kill half of the third world echofascism people want to say and then of course you have the liberal response how about let half of the third world die which will be less mean and require us to have a less course civic social order to facilitate that level of conscious violence. but another answer is have there be something other than the market to determine our social activity for the love of God, demarkatize some things, return to us our unalienated lives to some fucking degree, and the thing that does that in the imagine societies these guys have created in their heads, they're they're ideal. idealized feudalism, pre-modernism, pre-liberalism, pree jewification of world, precissification of the world, pre-soification of the world, the thing that gives, it is belief, it is belief in yes god, but God is an expression of a social life that gives one meaning and purpose beyond oneself indulgence, and that those ideas are invested with that, and that's what gives it as cohesion, it took generations and generations in the black death and a bunch of other shit. to dissolve that and replace it with selfishness and self-interest as the soul uh presiding uh source of um self-direction, i guess, the we can only be sincerely driven to self-interest, we cannot be sincerely driven to subverting, to sublimating our self-interest into others because we don't feel connected to one another, to put it bluntly. that connection has to be built, rebuilt, reforged, which can only be done by continuing to move through the fucking dialectic stages and contradictions of capitalism, and gain the technological uh uh sufficiency and concentration of capital resources to solve problems of resource scarcity and to distribute and to relieve pain, to relieve pain, to allow people to live and to find meaning outside of transaction and consumption, and that is the work of the left, and your most your most sincerely hearted neo-fed fascist, of course he's racist, but he's racist cuz like look, he'll talk you for 20, he'll he'll talk you into it in 24 hours away, he's not technically racist, and in his mind he doesn't think he is, and it doesn't matter if you're saying, but he is, he's lying, it doesn't matter, you, there's no judge to say because you're right, that means anything, he's still a force in the world you have to contend with, just saying it's not, no, no, you're fascist, you're racist, it doesn't work because they've worked it out for themselves why you're wrong, just like i've worked. out for myself when a fucking right winger says i'm wrong and i'm not going to change, and that's that means that you have to be challenge and not defeated on the level of arguing someone out of these beliefs, but in providing a context and a movement that can give people who would otherwise make that choice another fucking option. that is what it is, and so many people confused this idea of like, you need to go to the fucking queue and on people and give them a fucking pamflet about joining the DSA, no, if you're doing that, you're gone. It's about what is where are people being sucked and what is sucking them there, and one thing that's sucking people off in the direction of this uh reaction is the fact that they do have things in their social world that they do think that they that that means something more than the market, but they aren't, they're all ar, they're all just uh symbols, they they don't signif the emotional connection of a pre precapitalist subject, and so when people get to work, just like on the left, when people get to work, the sum total of their work, in the absence of meaning, and the absence of spirituality, in the in the absence of belief powering it is, is self-interest. look at the fucking people at Q and on now, look at how every one of these motherfuckers is the're getting arrested was either a federal agent himself or a fucking informant or they were there to fucking uh embezzle money from some fake go fund me they were running or they were doing a um... are doing some sort of social media scam, they're all picking each other's fucking pocket like Frank Sabadka said, that's all of us, we have to forge a new social consciousness, not before we do anything, but in order to defeat capitalism, which we all agree must be done, and beyond that there's a simple fact that you don't have the numbers, chumps, the working class is only weapon is numbers, and the fact that the thing doesn't work, for now, although the technology is being created to make this no longer true, that's the point of silicon valley, the material point, beyond people getting their beat wet beat wet and keeping the money flowing, silicon valley exists to make it so that in the near future they won't need us. That's it, and then politics can just be deleted from the program, politics as such, there is just corporate relations, you have an HR director instead of a uh representative in Congress, just they zero that fucking line out, if they can get that sufficient technology, now of course the race for that technology is a race we're both in, because if that is socialized, if those technologies are socialized, we could actually build the fucking thing, we can actually... the motherfucking thing, relieve the pain, relieve the source of the retreat to hostility and violence and othering, that powers these this politics primordially, and and makes it impossible to create class solidarity, and your racist shit, your white supremacy shit, it guarantees that you're only going to get white people, or at least white people and a nice chunk of like assimilated into whiteness people, that ain't. enough and the same way that any like ados and um and uh like hotep shit that's this the that is that is black reaction it's black reaction but we code. so black reaction is hard to see sometimes and and that and that whole thing is black reaction and it's the idea that we're going to protect our identity within this thing within this system, and once again, the people are actually mobilized are the people have some degree of capital within it, that's who is able to be online, those are the ones have capital to invest in in media ventures and political ventures, the ones who are able to asset some level of of uh ascension in the pecking order of capitalism, even though they are, held down generally by their racial category, you're going to get reparations but like how are you going to get reparations? why would what would you have? you don't have the numbers? you have, we all have to work together to fucking have anywhere near the the power to offset the advantage the capital has. okay, any of that makes sense? i hope so. Good, yeah, I felt this was a good one, felt like I got some useful stuff out of this. I do, I do hope we see uh Irish uh Irish unification. I will say one thing, if there is people worry like will the trouble start up again with like the dup and those guys pulling their guns, all the people really care are our mega people. uh and the guys with guns are all just selling fent, like all those loyalist gangs just are drug dealers now, they're fat, they're just too ticklike, they're they're not going to have the they'll be a little bit though, but they wouldn't do, they wouldn't do the whole thing, yeah marjerie taylor green is basically a dup uh member of parliament, she by the way it could very well be th if i don't know what's going to happen with Trump like he he seems like there's a very good chance that he might just up and and die uh, he just was that broken by this, but he could come back, can't say, but if he doesn't, she could fill that hole, I think even more than Bobert, especially since she has a much more like incendiary record, like all the shit's getting brought out about her, and the thing about it is the liberals are all thinking, oh, enough of this is going to come out, and then she's going to have to resign, I mean, I'm assuming that's what they think, cuz or or what, do they think they're going to get the house to kick her out? "if they think Nancy Pelosi is going to expell a member of congress for stuff she said, they are insane, but even if they did it, she would then be a marder and that is what you want to be, if you got to become famous on the right, becoming a marter is one of the best ways if you don't uh have your own tv show already, or she's going to go to jail or something, yeah, I'm sure, we need to hold her accountable, folks, yeah, we'll hold her accountable by making her uh, like the..." vp of my pillow guy. "there is no chance that we can unite with the barons, the barons are our enemy, there's they're more committed to maximalist capitalism, the their deepest commitments are to capitalism, their essential argument is if the whole thing breaks down and we have to go to like a hobsian state, i would rather build up from that and try to reassert like my my previous" privileges under the magnakarta than a seed to like my power slowly being attenuated by by a like the eventual assimilation into a global capital market they would rather fucking go down in the blaze of glory, the real hardcore of it, that's what they're fucking fighting for, the same way that their ancestors, the confederates did, they came to that point and they fucking they preferred, like none of them were going to get, none of them, none of the guys who uh, all of the guys at the top of the confederacy, all of the big land owners, I'm sure a lot of them were very leveraged and and indebted. needed to keep you know uh, they needed high conton prices and uh, in order to sustain their incomes, but a managed a managed end to slavery, a managed climb down from slavery, the kind that would have happened if the republicans had been allowed to govern, if the republicans had been allowed to govern, if Lincoln had been allowed to govern without the confederacy being created, and westward. uh territories were the the the extent of slave territory and was defined that would have caused a collapse of some sector of like the the cotton economy if it had eventually happened, but it would have been over time and those at the very top would have been able through uh increased markets, increased increased access to uh to credit instruments and bonds and all the all the goodies that come, all the investment grade goodies that come from a diversified economy, and they could have climbed down, but they wanted to keep it because it was more than just a system of government, because these things become fused with our essence, they are inextrickable, base and superstructure at the end of the day are the same thing, when we talk about them as different things, we're not talking about them as if they're occupy. different spaces, we're just talking about direction of action, it's like one big muscle fiber, where what direction is the is the impulse going, that's the only thing that base superstructure refers to, and so change happens when these moments of crisis come where compromise is no longer possible, and these fucking boat owners, these these barens, their threshold for compromise is lower than global capital because they hold tighter to the social element, they hold tighter tighter to the social dimension because they are more socially embedded, so they will never fucking give up their power, they will have to be defeated, they could be maybe utilized but only from a third angle, not because once if you allie ally with them, you guarantee that your base will be reduced, because everybody is operating in this cultural context, and it is unreasonable. to expect people of other racial categories to watch people ally with expressed people who express as part of their politics a hostility that is racial, that is that is xenophobic, that's unarguable, and people will be turned off by that, you will reduce your number, and I say it's not necessary, and in fact not only is it not necessary, it is wildly counterproductive. I will vote for Baron, he is the false Dimitri who will true prove to be the true air, one day he will emerge and set right that which was wrong, he will be our palties.
