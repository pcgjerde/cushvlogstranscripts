 some fucking nice weekend bullshit there we go 16 tons what do you get another day older and deeper and dead peter don't you call me cuz i can't go my soul to the company store some people say a man is made out of poor man's made out of muscle and blood muscle and blood and bone and steel and the right one won't get you then the left one well All right folks, how you doing? So I know that a lot of people have said after my post election stream when I laid out the case for the uh the incurable deadlock between two purely culturally effective political parties that cannot be resolved by any appeal to material conditions that that's black pill and that that's doom scrolling or whatever that means and especially since I just kind of ended with if something comes it'll come from below and I can't say what it is like god. damn that's a fucking um kick to the groonies, what? and while I still can't say how it'll happen or who will be participating in it because that's going to have to occur in the moment. I do think now, having thought about it a little bit that I have an idea a sense of what the general general shape of such a thing would be, so I could lay it out and given a description of how I think something might emerge the people could keep an eye out for uh and involve themselves with. uh, if it comes into their view personally, not something that imposed about from me or something that exists now, that's for sure, but like just structurally, just to give people a something to think about, well they're trying to tend their own garden without getting too doom doom scrolled or whatever the hell, so let's go to the election, let's start there, looks like biden has won, looks like the threat of the cump trump. literally did just turn out to him, be him asking someone else to do it, and everyone being like, now things are fine, uh, we'd rather keep, we wouldn't rather, we would not like to risk either our lives in the form of like his supposed shock troops, we're going to come and flood the zone and and initiate the day of the rope, or there are careers uh in the form of the people at the top of the uh political and judicial structure, and you might say, uh, well, you silly person, like they have no consequences, I don't think that's true, how it wasn't close enough for that to be the case, these it's like it's not a florida gour vush situation, there was no room for a a real grab that would have been normalizable, maybe like not something that the snake could digest, and so it all it away, so we're getting biten, and I know a lot of people are breathing a sy of relief, and some people are pointing to everybody who is breathing a sy of leaf and saying, aha, you cuck, you said all you could, you could say all you want about how you didn't like Biden and you weren't voting for him. but you are rooting for them, and that's the same thing, you're secretly just through your discussion, the way you framed them, you're brainwashing your audience to vote for Biden, you fucking cuck, I knew it, and as to that I say fairplay, because if the democrats are the don't be an asshole party and the republicans are the don't be a pussy party, I will admit at those cult, at that cultural level, I am a member of the don't be an asshole party, or otherwise known as a pussy, I fit the demographic, I went to fucking college, a middle class white kid, went to college at the right time. have the right combination of life experiences to connect to the college experience in a way that conditioned me towards having certain social views about cosmopolitanism and things like that and i know that those are uh you know um uh and i know that those are real issues with real policies related to them you know police funding and you're talking about racial justice or something like that you know immigration that those all connect to real things. with real consequences, but for me they are felt effectively, they are felt emotionally, they're not really part of my like material interests because I'm a white male, but I know it's not, it's an asshole to just let people get exploited and and races and done racism on, um, and fair enough, uh, I cop to that, I have those views, because that part of the conditioning I keep, I've kept, because It's not like the new theory is like those set of affects are uh uh like neoliberalism it's no they are the cultural uh uh like architecture. of the broad cosmopolitan uh point of view, which is contrasted with the parochial point of view that is uh manifested in the don't be a pussy republican party, those are the people who didn't go to college and absorb those things or went to college and rejected those things and i'm not one of them, so i am fucking rooting for biden, i'm sorry, i was cop to it, although i have to say though, i have absolutely no faith that this is going to be a... better outcome than Trump having one re-election. In fact, I think there's a very good chance it's a worse outcome. I mean, nothing to be done about it, there was never anything to be done about it by any of us be realistic, but I, I, I, when I look at the next four years, the way this vote happened, I really do see no reason to have any thought other than, um, the uh, divided government means that nothing of any consequences passed beyond like the... the the the very merest like minimal amount of uh of uh recovery money and and and such and that we will allow ourselves to go through a second Cleveland term response to a crisis where we just sort of allow it to continue without any kind of significant government intervention. the only big if we get any big legislation it will be something like a entitlement reform uh the the grand bargain that McConnell is waiting and salavating at the prospect of passing and which with a democratic house led by Nancy Pelosey. instead of a fucking crazy group full of tea party psychos uh under a bainer who wouldn't take a deal when it was given to them by Obama they might actually be able to get it uh culturally all the wars that we think are over are only going to get more intense and more annoying I mean I think that the the uh particular keening w of them will go down because Trump's not there to like keep the uh keep the liberals psychotically activated but just the general drift is going to ratchet towards more conflict and there's going to be more police. violence, there's going to be more demonstrations about police violence, there's going to be more political violence in general, the people are going to spectaclize and assimilate into their political view and it's going to harden things, mean and that means that those newly introduced republicans who showed up uh the ones who aren't just going to stop paying attention are going to become more convinced of their republicanness uh, but more importantly all of the people who came up to stop biden uh are in the mid-term going to stop paying attention, you'll see another red wave like in 2010 and then uh a... failure to recover it all from the uh collapse unlike the fake recovery we got under Obama that was then covered with Obama's personal charisma and like narrative power to shape shape our you know relationship to the government uh just Joe Biden's ricky skeleton uh presiding overall like a fucking Donce Maccab uh we he gets destroyed by whatever comes after Trump Donald Trump Jr. John Tafer my pillow guy maybe Tom Contonn or Josh Harley I mean it's gonna be a battle royale but whoever it is it's that and then you get locked in like a full suite of anti-democratic things that legitimately limit franchise and that uh allow for the full like securitization of life, the full privatization of life for the coming breakup you know into the technocantons and and the dissolution of central authority, which is the end gauge game of that faction of capitalism, it's political expression, and the Democratic party will be unable at every point to stop this because it's i've said, their drift cannot be reversed, they can only double down on what they have been doing, like you see it, oh uh, trump won because America is more racist than we thought, well we're just going to have to scream more about racism then, okay, that guarantees that all those people who started who voted for Trump in 2020, because they think that's a bunch of pussy bullshit talk, are going to double down on it, uh, and meanwhile, new, all those working class people you're hoping to bring into the into politics, they're going to see you reaching and howling and they're going to mostly tell you to shut the fuck up because they didn't go to finishing school and meanwhile the democratic party will just be the party of college educated professionals and the problem with them is that they don't stay in big parts of the country that are demographically rewarded with congressional representation and political influence places where that make up 270 electoral votes and that are where people are uh where senators where two senators can be elected by a couple hundred thousand people they leave those spots and they go concentrate in already dense urban areas and contribute to already lopsided political victories that mean that their influence over legislation is basically non-existent. those people in the middle, those are the people who are leftover, those are the older folks, those are the ones wh didn't go to college or came back from college and said it was a bunch of dumb bullshit and didn't go off to seek their fortune in the big city, and they will just be republicans and that means you will not even be able to get to 270 and it does matter how many votes you win by in the popular vote, you'll never get another fucking uh electoral code victory. he'll never be able to change uh get rid of the electoral college either, and the response will only be to double down on identity, because that's all that exists and all that exists for republicans too, it's a mirror image thing like they'... will be doubling down on identity, like all during the Trump administration, people have been complaining about how the democrats and leftist in general are talking about identity too much, so was Trump to a different group of people, and the issue is is that for the non-college educated uh, when you talk about those issues, it redounds to the benefit of the don't be a pussy party, because don't be a pussy is a more visceral and understandable reaction to this kind of stuff because you have not learned the undergurting ideas, and in fact a lot of these people say you should never have to tell anybody those because not their job to educate you, meaning that you're guaranteed to hear this shit, have it bounce off, if you even say yeah, these guys should shut the fuck up. so I mean, that is, that's a bad, that's a bad case, and it and it undermines hilariously the only case you could have made for biden, which was harm mitigation, right? you can't make an ideological case for voting for Biden that he's going to make anything better, uh, and you can't uh, and in his case you couldn't even have. made a harm reduction argument in my opinion, but of course the harm reduction argument was in the process, it was in the assumption of, well we're going to take all these voters in this crisis election and they're all going to vote for democrats and we're going to get a blue wave that gives us the senate, and yeah, we have the phillibuster, but hey, we'll be able to get rid of the Philipbuster, and I know we don't think it's going to happen, but it could, and just the prospect of that fills them with this idea that there's possibility, and they convinced themselves that that's what they're voting for when they vote for Biden, what they get is the result of this party present. fighting over these conditions, which is uh college educated people basically being guilted by the TV and and like their fellow college educated people into getting rid of the the the bad orange rude man, many of them if they're wealthy enough, sticking to voting republican down ticket because they're still class conscious along those lines and they know that their interests are in low taxes since that's basically what the government does, but low high taxes, what else does it do? that's kind of it because everything else has been pushed off the fucking table as a possibility as... as an intervention that the that the government can do into the market, and they're either going to be doubling down on that cultural shift or say, well Trump's Trump's gone, now I've normalized Trump, so nothing's going to shock me anymore, and I'll just wrote republican again, you'll have those uh, you know, younger ideologically committed democrats who are either, you know, class traders, liberal class traders who think they're on the side of the... of the downtrodden, even though the democratic party is a capitalist party as integral to the maintenance of capitalism and its exploitative system as the republicans are, but they don't think of it that way, they think they're the party of the downtrotten because they're the party of minority views and uh and uh you know uh uh uh the the uh yeah minority rights against the oppressive majority like that's that what left means it doesn't have anything to do with distribution because once again distribution is not on the... but those people will be concentrated in these fucking cities and that means they'll never be able to exercise power over the federal government, which means as as capitalism gets more savage and extractive and and social cohesion and social uh obedience are undermined, the techno surveillance machinery of of of of control will be instituted by the republican party essentially, the which means it probably be will be have like explicit racial character. to it, now say the democrats win though, like this is the real grim shit is that say you break out of that somehow without under, i don't think you could, but if you could break out of that somehow without changing the undermining, undergirding reality that the democrats are not a working party, they are a workers party, they're a capitalist party, if you could somehow get them to uh uh winning, get them to power in in an event of a crisis, all you're going to do is is is is uh is the cliche joke about uh you know rainbow uh painted nose coned predator drones, it will be the the violence will be maybe more less distributed by explicit racial categories, but it will be as oppressive and stratified along uh uh class, so like there's not even really a harm reduction case for Trump because That's the're all, it all ends badly, because say they somehow parlay a bad Trump response in the second term to COVID to like people just kind of shrugging their shoulders be like, things are so bad and these are the only options, I guess we'll give them a chat, and then they will just be presiding over catastrophe from the point of view of stabilizing capitalism at the expense of us, like Chuck Schhumer saying, people are killing themselves because we're evicting them, let's give cops the power to detain them if they show evidence that they want to self-harm, that will be the democratic response to... crisis, instead of you, build a wall and and and lock up these these uh, these immigrant children, it'll be like a little drone buzzing over your head that'll blow your brains out if you uh, if you frown too many times. but it will be the same essential machine for the same essential uh purpose pulling the last fucking marrow out of the bones of the system before it collapses now once again this is long long time frames but if we're talking about a political party and like the the the relationship between political power parties over time and presidential elections we're talking long time scales and we all know that the time scales gologically and echoologically are getting narrower so i'm not saying in anyone's life. time even let was listening to this, but in in in generations, this will be the trajectory either way, and as I said, that cannot be changed from within itself because of how it's structured, because uh, because there is no class politics that is going to be able to inject itself into the overall dynamic between democrats and republicans, because as I have said, uh, the we have now reached a point where the the end result of the democrats no longer being the party of material advancement for the working class or the downtrodden or whatever. for for for 40 years the democrats ran this country basically uninterrupted, even with Eisenhower and nixon in charge, the democrats ran this country because they went every two years out and said we're the party of a bigger paycheck, after the 70s they could never do that again, not in real sense, not with any kind of conviction. behind it, either in policies or in people's memory of their ability to to to deliver on those promises, so they've had to find something else to stand in for the party of the downtroden, and because their new constituency was college educated people have absorbed ideas about the character of alienation and oppression in this country that have nothing to do with class and everything to do with discrimination along identity access, that narrative is now the accepted idea of what it means to be a a part. of the of the little guy, it's to defend them against unjust uh uh uh unjust uh an unjust oppression that prevents one from fully participating in the market, like that's the real crime of racism and sexism and all other of the patriarchal boogiemen, is not any kind of violence against human dignity, so much as violence against the ability of a human to intergage in market relationship. the way it uh like everyone else does for one's for one's own personal pleasure seeking as the homoeconomics libertarian automaton that we're all supposed to be, and the reason the democrats I think are doomed in this dynamic no matter what is that over time as politics gets louder and louder to deal with the fact that things are going to get worse and worse, "there's not going to be a big influx of these college educated people into the electorate, they're already there, they're baked in. what's going to happen is you're going to have like what happened in 2020, which is a a investment by depoliticized socially reactionary working people, because they have not absorbed the the manner system that they got in college, and they're going to see the options we have, and they're going to become republicans, and that means that you will have this situation where the demographic advantage of the democrats along all." axesses, except racial, in the case of black people, but even along income is going to go away, big chunk of the people are just still not going to be voting at all, they will be deeper into despair, but those who do vote are going to vote with more anger, and it's going to be directed against the people who do want them to keep their voice down even though everything is terrible. i think a good example of the dynamic going forward is uh, does anyone know the name uh, what's their name, this woman who is elected in in a upset? uh in the congress this name lawren Bobbert, the one who owns shooters grill, the queuenon lady in Riffle Colorado, uh, her her story is interesting because uh, she has the story of someone who historically would be a democrat, she was born in Florida when she was 12, she moved to Denver, she said, that she had democratic parents and she they lived in poverty, her mom was on welfare, uh she went to worked at McDonald's and she was 15, she got a ged, she's like a fucking uh uh, she got uh pregnant in high school and dropped out, she she got her ged this year, like a real American like striver uh, and that background according to everything we've absorbed is supposed to make you you know a democrat. but the reason it isn't is cuuse she's white and so it's like well yeah but she's racist so therefore of course she's a republican but the problem is uh nobody is just racist for no reason that i know that's what we've been told that. 1619 project in tiny houses coats have told us that racism is this intrinsic thing to American life, it's a stain and I would say like race distinction is, but racism as in an operating principle that guides your behavior is not, I'm sorry, and I know you're going to say, yes, but at the sub-atomic level, it's there every moment, it's like, yes it is, but I also think that when it's at that level, its manifestation isn't really noticeable, isn't worth freaking out about, isn't a thing that you should be tearing your flesh over out about, I'm sorry, she's racist for some reasons, but look at her. life, you know, we're supposed to use mitigating circumstances when considering people who do bad things, like she had a shitty life, she blames people for it, why is she blaming black people instead of uh, if she's racist, i mean, maybe she isn't racist, i don't even know, one way, maybe she does just blame elites for why things are bad, but why does she think that it's democrats, why does she think republicans aren't elites? it's because the only thing she's ever known about this party is that it's about this set of uh of... displays of concern for other people and that you're supposed to not want anything for yourself, which is of course what upper middle class, polite liberals see politics as, but somebody whose life has been like bad, somebody who's struggled, somebody's been in poverty, they're not necessarily worried about how empathic they look to other people because they're trying to fucking survive, and liberals and democrats don't seem to care about them, so I know that sounds like oh he's justifying racism. got once again, i wouldn't vote for her, she shouldn't be in charge, but if we're talking about people in general, these things carry out over time, and if you take this bobert woman and you look at her background and you compare her to someone like Aoc and it's like, oh she's like Aoc, Aoc also struggled, Aoc also worked, she was a bartender, it's like, yeah, but she was also a congressional aid, and she went to fucking Boston college, majors in political science, this is a person who has received the eticat lessons that you're supposed to, and it's like: look, this bronx Latina, look, she's a good socialist, yeah, because she went to fucking college, and if the question is, is the future going to be sorting the party into the part into the party, sorting people as they come into politics while things are getting worse and worse, into the democrats and republicans to fight over it, and it's Aoc versus this bobert woman, considering how shitty everything is, there's a lot more people in this country who are going to be in her boberts position than in Aoc's. that are going to have the chance to go to college to get a four-year fucking degree in some uh in political science. so some people are like, why does he keep talking about college like this? the there's plenty of non-college educated people in the democratic party and there's tons of uh college educated republicans. of course there is. "the reason I'm talking about college is because when we're talking about the electorate in general, we're divided into these demographic groups and then try to analyze their voting behavior and we put those on top of one another and it gives us a sense of like what people are, the politically engaged people in this country anyway, what they are politically, what they view, how they view things and and and and and how like uh the experience of being an American is is is absorbed, and those are all things that people do feel about, those all are ways of people. will absorb uh um things like college education, things like race, age, uh, gender, those things uh, income all do, but the problem is is in America, because we've got thanks to our ability to spread broadly, or more broadly than historically has been the case, um, our lucer, after world war 2, we created this thing that's kind of not existed before, called the middle class, this lumpin small boujois in America, or at least it became lumpin, as we got super... organized and atomized thanks to media and and geographic sorting uh what was I talking about? yeah, so sormp and middle class, the one uh, they are the ones to vote generally, so like this is the electorate, it's one of the things that always made fascism, like the question about fascism sort of interesting because like... fascism emerged in the 20s and 30's as a way to counter working class political mobilization, and they did it by essentially mobilizing the lump and bourjois, the lump and lower classes in Germany and Italy. the thing is in America, there is no left-wing movement among the working class, the working class is politically inert, so it's all an intra middle class movement, like people say, oh all these young men are turning into proud boys, like well yeah, but it's they're not, they're not emerging into conflict with a working class class. sp conflict, it's just another, it's a show off with other college kids, it's other middle class strata kids, and the reason i think uh college is so important as the one demographic descriptor, not only because we're seeing. things pull towards college very dramatically over the last couple of elections, but because of all those markers we're talking about, college retainment, gender race uh, the only one of these that really gets even even income, even income I would say, the only one that's the only one, the one of these that gets closest to actually pegging tum towards class as it's lived in america is a college, because the thing about classed America is that even though our lives totally determined by our class, class is not a lived experience because we are not conscious of ourself, for the most part, some people are, but the vast majority or not, we do not walk around conscious of ourselves as members of a class, we are much more conscious of ourselves as those other things, man uh gender and and racial uh, but college having gone to college marks you as having gone through a essentially an ideological car wash and most importantly that because basically a ton of working class people's kids went out college after World War II and came out uh with professional jobs and and move from the working class to this uh to this middle class this lumpin lower bourgeois uh that means that a lot of people grew up in middle class homes means they went their parents went to college which means they absorbed college from their... parents and then they went to college and then they came out having gone through the ideological carwash and uh and that means that they are somewhere in this middle class like there are some who are going to jump way up and like the the rich of course send their kids to college but also they're demographically irrelevant but you know some people jump up in income from before they before what what they grew up from uh some people do rise from the working class. to go to college, they are the minority, but they do, and then some of them go off to be very wealthy, uh, some have significant uh collapse, in fact the whole generation of these millennials is all kind of nose dived, but they have nose dived back to sort of being in like a uh income or even working uh class relationship that is similar to people who didn't go to college, but having gone to college, and the reason that's important, is because the experience of going to college uh creates your conception of yourself as a political subject, either because you went yourself, your parents did instilled those things in you, and then you didn't go because you didn't like them, or your uh, or if you didn't go to college, you absorb culture, because everything that is made to be consumed uh in the media is made by and for. people to go who went to college because they are professional because uh art is a professional endeavor now and professional credentials are required for professional endeavors or were at least traditionally in in in our system now and that though and that so artists are overwhelmingly uh going to be people went to college and from the point of view of commerce people went to college since they make up this middle class these are the this is the group of... people who are most numerous and have the most money buse the poor there's a lot of them but they don't have any money and also how do you even talk to them since there's very few poor people who make art that is seen by the masses and the rich who yes they can be owning all these things and they can have their kids like you know become actors cuuse they're bored but you know bill gates can only see aquaman how many so many times by himself even if it doesn't cost him a lot of his fortune to go see the movie you need a lot of people watching movies you need a lot of people exposing themselves advertising, you need a lot of people watching these shows, so it's all pitched to the middle class, so they're absorbing all these morts too, but the experience of so everyone had who is politically active is what i'm saying, is is that way because of their exposure to the psychological regimen to the value system that is created by college, this is what Moldbug called the cathedral, and it's real, it's real, but the thing is is that it's assumed that this thing exists to make people democrat. and while it is true that that is the intention, i would think of the majority of the people make up the collegiate structure, that is not the full purpose, it it it creates political subjects, it creates people see themselves politically, and now the people within it want to create democrats, but because the experience of college is not, you know, it's not a factory, it's a bunch of individuals going into it, all of them with individual life experiences, individual makes democrats on purpose, it also by accident makes almost as many republicans, because they go to college where they have exerbed college in their media, have go, grow to detest those values and then decide to hold the other values, the asshole values, because what you learn in college is the don't be a pussy world view, which is cosmopolitan, which is uh worldly which assumes in equality of all individuals, the equality of rights of all people, and and the necessity to create some sort of social justice, like that is really it, and a lot of people absorb those views and think, yes, that's good, a lot of people, and and I think that broadly those are correct in abstract, the problem is is that they are not, as they are encountered in college. and in the culture produced by college, they are turned into this brittle list of uh personal virtues that are expressed through concern, not through actual policies that are going to help anybody, like that's the key part about this is that this this this soul washer that we built to send people through and have them come out uh valuing you know diversity and all these things uh is in a system where you're literally telling them at the same time that you're telling them that uh there's perpressed people in the world uh and that uh you know it's the duty to make things better for everybody, you're telling them that communism cannot work, that uh, that competition and uh is and uh is competition is like the the the essence of human experience that uh that the economy is a uh system produced to create like maximal value through uh people seeking their self-interest in the marketplace and on top of that uh but and so but in that system, in this system that is immutable, because remember we're not teaching you any marxism, like that's the big joke about right wingers is that there's a bunch of marxists in the academy, marx has been purged from the academy for decades, marx is not taught as a serious option, marx is taught as a historical curio and a dead end that didn't take into consideration such intersecting issues as patriarchy and racism and blah blah blah and that means that when you absorb this stuff you're not just absorbing equality, you're absorbing that the only problem that is caused by inequality is personal manners, is people being mean to one another, it's not systemic, reinscribement of the social uh exploitation, because that's not the thing, remember society is not a system for exploiting, the side the society is not the halvs sucking the fucking life force uh and species being out of the the the half nots exploiting those with only their labor to sell uh to by vampire like sucking their surplus, no, no, no, it's equal exchange of of of desires across the the equal marketplace uh and if there's if black people are or immigrants are disadvantage or women it's because people are mean and we're going to make them nice and that's not a viable answer and people you either ignore that fact because you're caught up in like the drama of either having experienced those oppressions and wanting to see them corrected or being if you haven't feeling guilty that they're being done on your behalf and one, either way, you have an emotional investment, if you don't have an emotional investment, like say you're a white male, you're more likely to go, uh, yeah, maybe the they're they're just less, maybe they're just not as good, like if this is all uh, if this is an open contest and they're behind, maybe it's because they're shitty, like if this is a race, it's like, oh, they they're being held back, but it's like, I'm not holding them back, I'm seeing them advance, like they're all over the place, and yet they're not cutting the mustard, there's no answer for that other than uh, no, it's because you're racist, that's why they're doing, it's, it's circular, it cannot, it cannot get towards actual justice uh, and so this machine creates these numbers of these well-intentioned liberals who think they're being nice people even though they're really doing is taking a bunch of excuses to be mean to other people and to hate other people, to displace their anxiety about being at the top of an economic rung or whatever, they want to punish them, and so they inscribe their hatred. upon you know knuckle dragging the theaderhalls men being trash and then they they decide to to you know hate them uh and then or you join the team of assals and be like it's these winy pussies and these fucking uh lazy minorities they're covering for. so the way this works. is that America has this weird middle class that's not distinct in its relationship to the means of production, it contains people the term professional manager. a class i prefer lumpen petit bourjois because it's a very specific American flavor of this where it is never gathered together into any self-conscious thing because class was being abolished when it was being created as a concept that was lived by suburbanization and mass culture and so no one has ever thought of themselves as a class the way that like the small bouchois maybe did in Germany and so uh they have to be turned into aware of of their uh place because the thing about these people in the middle class is that the broad middle class, the reason that it's such a weird category and it's such a liminal space is that they are not as the working class are purely exploited by the system, they're not as the ruling class are pure beneficiaries of the of the extractive system, they are both largely victims and perpetrators, they might have employees, people that they hire on like a freelance basis or even as direct employees, they might uh, they're members of professionals, they're managers of other employees. That's a big part of it is management, like you have people who you could fire, but someone could fire you. It is a liminal, it's a spot between, and this has always existed in every society, but in America, we've been able because of the post war boom and everything, we created this huge explode, explosion of these things and it created the need to create things like the bullshit jobs David Grayber talks about, because people had to have something to do, my god, we've got too much free time here, we got too much free time and we can't just have people sitting around, they're going to get ideas, so everybody has to get. becoming managers and and uh and and consultants and all this horror shit and then their kids live these lives where their parents are and them are the experience of plenty boom and bust you know lean years and fat years uh and and you know the good and the bad side of being in this middle spot in the capitalist pecking order uh but they're nonetheless they are the they are being exploited and therefore they suffer alienation as the working class do. and that working that alienation at some point turns into or can turn into depending on how you experience it can turn into something called class consciousness where you're like oh these are not discrete symptoms of displeasure in my life. these are all epiphenomenal to a single daily moment by moment attack on my spirit and soul which is that i have been denuded of my fucking species being. at like a basic level control over my time on earth by my by my un uh requested my necessary my my uh my my cursed like my i'm like i am as a serf was bound to the wage relationship and for many people that never occurs and in the 19th century like the the the working class as mark saw coming together and then it was ratified to see come together. later uh, the the collective experience of coming to a city, living in a in a district of workers and doing the same job with other people, just the the mere social exchange within that relationship produces a residence of experience between people a checking of notes that finds one answer, and then that is class consciousness. there is no mechanism to create that in American now, it was broken by the prosperity really of the post neural era, so the but so the people who are now were being born to the boomers and to the exers, they emerge into a world that has been denatured of any kind of real class consciousness, and they find themselves in this, for the most part these middle class people in this liminal spot between the two, uh, and so they might never put this in a a class context or more specifically in a political context, they might not ever think, oh, these things can be addressed by a uh political project. That's what now, if you grow up around middle class people, that's basically impossible, like as a kid you learn, these are political concerns, this is a political world, your parents have political views, so you know the things that are good, now it it this is probably all a bunch of cultural epiphenomenal bullshit, like you know uh abortion or or uh, if you're like the anti-abortion movement, you know like all these people in the 70s they're terrified of the fact that people that the that the working that the uh that the nuclear family was being pulled apart when it was being pulled apart by the fact that you couldn't have a fucking nuclear family anymore, you couldn't afford it, but we're going to put it on the blame of women wanting to be able to control the reproduction because they now have to engage in the wage relationship. forget that, it's going to be abortion, so like even though abortion is a real issue that has real consequences, the reason people are mad about it, the reason it's a political football is because they have a false conception of what it means, what they're really mad about is something driven by the economic system that under an idealized a person, especially if they are going to college, they think we're going to learn something about the world, and it's where they're given a form, because in college is when most people encounter for the first time concepts like communism, socialism, wage relationship, you know, economics, that kind of stuff, and that is where they are then able to emerge and go, oh, oh shit, damn, there's this whole thing about the economy and how that structure stuff, wow, now of course, college then informs you as soon as it informs you that yeah, you know, these things are real. and also you know the country you came from it had a lot of violence in it and it's had a lot of exploitation in its history and you know there's been a lot of pain and bloodshed and you feel very shocked about that and if you're white you might start feeling guilty about it, but then with the next breath you any any idea that there's like a new frontier for uh uh like uh changing that at a fundamental level is for close and you are left having to deal with those epinomenon if you want to feel like a good person uh because there's two ways you can learn about something like your class and what it means to be in a class relationship, through experience and through uh uh instruction, and middle class in America, until recently, now the ones who are out of college, although first to not experience that since the post war era, uh, those middle class people aren't experiencing it because while they are exploited, it's masked, their exploitation is masked by the fact that they're relatively well off and they put it on on to other things, so that it's almost impossible for middle class people to get a lived experience without the intervention of instruction on what it means to be in a class, poor people have, but the thing is is that while they have the lived experience of class exploitation, they don't in this world that we live in now have the ability to compare notes the way that working class people used to be able to to, and so that whole gets filled with you know whatever is in the culture around them, which ends up being stuff like you know alex. a lot of the time or or other you know entertainment products that sort of fill in the void of of that instruction that is not there if you did not participate in college so the people in college get this first experience of class consciousness and they process it in two ways depending on not their income or their family's income or anything not if they came from the working class not if they're in the middle class not if they're coming down from the mountain top of wealth and privilege to get an education for some. which a lot of them do because what else are you going to do with your time? uh, they can all have different reactions, it's not determined. uh, the individual response is going to be determined by your individual life experience, like i, for example, i think the fact that my spinal column just exploded when i was in high school, and i nearly died and i was in a wheelchair, it basically made it impossible for any reactionary, social argument to hold sway with me, because no argument that anyone has anything bad coming to them because of like where they were born, like what skin they were born into or what social position they were born into, well ever hold sway for me because i am more intimately aware than most people in my position of the fundamental and terrifying contingency of life on this fucking planet, the fact that nothing is earned, that everything is is is a random uh uh thunderbolt that we have to deal with, and that our ability to thrive in life is largely our ability to just avoid through. happen stance, the calamities that surround us. other people have different experiences, maybe you had really annoying hippy parents and you're and they're like really mean but also sanctimonious and it like turned you off on the entire thing, or you had like evangelical psychos and you've decided that conservativism is inherently bad, but you get to college and you learn all these cosmopolitan things, hey in case you didn't know, all the other people in the world they're all equal, they all deserve life on this planet, but many of them are struggling and that's bad and we should do something about it. Now if you didn't go to college, there's two ways you process that, if you have had likely, and like I said, didn't go to college doesn't necessarily mean poor, but it disproportionately means poor, uh, and specifically it means your parents probably didn't go to college, which means they probably make less money than the parents of the people who did go to college. If your parents didn't go to college. if your parents didn't go to college and you worked your way to college, like you took out loans or whatever, you very well could see all this stuff and be like, i made it, fuck you, and if you get out of college and are successful and you're like driven and that's how you got there, and that's how you made it, you are might have contempt for the people you know in those con conditions who didn't get out, like jay vance for example, or you know uh um uh like uh uh you know pull up your pants guy you know like made it, they didn't, you know, like poverty doesn't ennoble the character, like poor people, being poor sucks and it takes people have a hard time empathizing with others sometimes, and it makes it harder for, it makes people mean sometimes. not everybody, but it makes some mean people, and if you're poor and you're around mean poor people sometimes, you decide, fuck them, or and then maybe you decide, you see all this stuff, the democratic wrapping and you're like, fuck this, I'm republican, or you say, yeah, I, I, I feel a kinship with the with the suffering of these other people, once again, this comes down to the personal experiences you had that made you think that way, I'm broadly speaking a democrat, I might consider myself a left-winger, but I'm a democrat, and this is where I have to say. but these are binary categories, everybody uh went to college uh or votes votes consistently along a political axis or doesn't vote but because they're making a point about it is one of these or the other because they're very broad they reflect the broad binary dynamic of American politics they are democrats and republicans a lot of people say oh democrat that's like i don't like the democrats, i didn't bite for joe biden, i never told anybody to vote for joe biden, but broadly speaking i'm a democrat, but here's the fucking shot plot twist motherfucker, you are also a democrat, everyone listening to this, everyone watching this, i would wager is a democrat, even if you didn't go to college, you have absorbed left ideology to the point where you're on that side of the cultural divide, you have the same sort of visceral responses to these cultural signifiers. even if you know they are cultural signifiers. now if you go to now wealthier people who go to college, if for one reason or another they don't feel guilty about the fact that they're exploiting other people and that they are the the that they just suck and a lot of people do, they harden their hearts one way or the other or for one reason or another uh they say no fuck them, they should be that way and they're republicans uh, but people who are wealthy and don't, who do have like a a human connection, haven't like forsworn that human connection, haven't sid to justify themselves, they become democrats, but of course they become liberal democrats because they're never going to want to get rid of class uh hierarchy because it benefits them, they are much more likely to decide, you know what, class is always going to be there, but racial discrimination and all these uh inequalities, we could do something about those, just so happens they don't really do anything about me except. me except what i might have to pay higher taxes, at the end of the day rich people can always afford to pay more fucking taxes, and then you got the middle class where they experience life and their parents experience life both exploiting and exploiting or or not or their exploitation is not felt as class exploitation and they might come aware of the very idea that their class exploited in college and be like, whoa, how do they respond? that boils down to whether they decide to feel a a kinship with the working class even if they aren't technically part of it and even and or they are, or they decide to disdain the working class and adhere in their heart to capital for specific personal individual reasons, but the thing is you get these like these might be random, these might be a happenstance within an individual, but over large groups of people they sort into broad categories and broad broad world views that people hold and so you you shift these working class, these these these college educated middle class people into sort of in their hearts working class people, whether they are or aren't believe they're part of a project with other working class people to to get rid of all the racism and the bad stuff or maybe if they're more radical you know get rid of uh capitalism either through the democratic party or defeating it but maybe voting for it strategically sometimes and then you've got the uh the ones to decide yeah no my b my... had uh you know he worked his ass off to become an insurance salesman and yeah his boss rid him but you know he uh he wanted to get good work out of him and he got and then he took over the boss ship and i could be the boss someday and those become republicans and these things are pulling these two groups to identify along to access, and a lot of it is about gender, because gender is felt much more closely to one's lived experience than uh than classes, and it's the and it's actually structured by our relationship to that college education we got, and like the the language we learn in college is the education, is the is the manners of the professional sector, which is in like engagement terms in in social terms. one of the things you really learn in school is to act like that, that is, and so women are more likely to find that uh uh agreeable because they have been conditioned to be like that because of gender expectations, men are going to be less comfortable with it, so that helps split this out, this is more, this means that men are more like of all races are more likely to go through that process and come out as republicans, women are more likely to come out as democrats, and then you've got the men who identify as uh, you know, with that working class, with those oppressed people, they're more likely, they're going to be male feminist, they're going to be there still being, and then women who are like, feminism is stupid, are going to follow the men to the republican side, but the leading gender like split is in that direction, so in all cases, like it's going to have people of every group, but I'm talking the the poles, where the where the things demographically aggregate into parties that are going to then vote and determine the outcome of the fucking political system, and so uh, what this means is is that over time uh, these working class people who have not gone through that process of coming into like... full awareness of the of the virtue of this specific uh cultural uh uh etiquet are going to be brought into politics by the trauma of the moment, offered a choice between you know vigorous uh uh uh resistance of uh of formalized nicity uh and a series of elaborate social uh demands uh kabuki uh uh abnegations. that have no goal, that have no uh benefit, because that is the key point to all of this, this is the thing that's going to drive the democratic party into oblivion uh, is that all of this stuff, well self-evident, the virtue of which is self-evident to people who went to college and adhered to the democratic worldview, the people who said yes to all those things about inclusivity and yes all those things about privilege and yes to all those things about the need for diversity and voices being heard and all that uh it all makes sense to them and the way that it relates to human uh flourishing makes sense, but if you have not encountered it at all, let alone rejected it, you hadn't even had the chance, or which is a lot, this is a lot of chases, you would reject it through uh viewing it through the culture and the media and saying it's sanctimonious bullshit, because you have not been absorbed into it, when you see it, all you see is a demand to be quiet, all you see is a demand to be nice, all you see is a demand on you to behave a certain way for no benefit to you, the benefit of someone else. and why you're supposed to care about them, you could get there and you could even get to a point where hey, helping them helps me, if you go through like a whole political awakening, but Americans aren't doing that if they're being asked to fucking fill in a form every four years, they're going to see the thing in front of them and they're going to be respect respond to something that if they went to college and said fuck this uh or they didn't, they saw it the culture and said fuck this, are going to say fuck this. so the upshot of this to me is that any question about how to politically engage with this perpetual doomsday machine that we've created between the two parties, this dance of death, this tumble off richenbock falls between the two political parties, cannot be done through the democratic party, cannot be done through the through the device of the Democratic Party, because the Democratic Party is in my opinion fully and completely the party of pussies, it is the party of manners and politeness to anyone outside of the the the educational matrix responding just to its cultural uh uh expressions and its political expressions, it is just the party of keeping your voice down, and that means that anyone within it trying to reach people outside. of that bubble will be received the same way, even if they're socialist, even if they're they're saying medicare for all in full throat, because they're not, all that is going to be heard is that through the fucking filter of all the other bullshit that the democratic party actually in a day-to-day basis represents these people, which is unpleasant interactions with unpleasant liberals both online, in the real world and on television and then the fucking uh movies. if there will be a democratic expression of working class challenge to the coming neoliberal austerity hell, it will come in the form of a new party. not a break away from the democratic party, but a party that emerges from labor action, the actual coordination of people in their place of work where those people doing that work come to organization, the same way they did in the fucking 20s and 30s, the same way they did in the fucking 1870s when pinkertons were shooting them, and in so doing that, "they will, because they live in the United States and because even if you are not part of the college uh you know uh uh eticat lesson uh people even if you have not absorbed the values of going and voting because that's the important thing here is that uh is that you say like well what about uh uh what about all these demn to trump what about all these trump to dem uh white people are" republicans, didn't they say fuck the pussies? it's like, yes, they did. but the thing you're getting from college isn't just the content of the cosmopolitan worldview, it's the container, which is objective reality, which is norms and institutions, which is the constitution means something, and the presidency has meaning, and voting has a worth, that's why you do it, and that means that when Trump shows up and does his clown show for four years, even if you are not really that uh attached to the fucking uh democratic party, even if you are as a you know republican adhere. towards a policy of keeping your taxes low uh at all costs, you very well might decide, okay, this is too far, especially when the op other option is Joe Biden, that's why people are mad at the that the uh the democrats were doing what they did and hitting them pitching themselves to Suburban Republicans, I'm sorry, but it was their only play, because the democratic party, unless burnie had been the nominee, and even then I wonder would have been able to break through that, and so the only voters they could realistically get were. them now what they didn't anticipate is that a bunch of these working class people would now come into the electoral process and say fuck you pussies, that's what that's why they're own, but their general strategy was the only one they could have pursued, because this is not something that is chosen, this is something that is predicated by the algorithm of the party, and by it's now it's it's it's it's demographics, so those those uh Trump to uh Biden voters. you know they they never bought into all the fucking stuff about uh lived experience and and and uh reparations and shit like that, i mean that's why they voted down ticket republican, but they do think that Trump is a bad president and an erratic president and therefore should probably get out of there and get a nice quiet guy who's not going to get everybody riled up all the time. so anything in the democratic pile would pile, anything coming out of the democratic branding is going to be buying for those people, and they don't know it, that's the thing, the people who are even doing this, like the people on the left of the Democratic party who are imagining some Aoc led insurgency, they are not even aware. that their project is still born, because they think no, we'll reach out, we'll reach out to these people, it's like, yeah, you will, but they're just going to see some bullshit, they're going to see Aoc, they're going to hear, when you say medicare for all in free college, they're going to hear fucking Charlie Brown's mom, but then when you say intersectionality and uh, and kids in cages, they're going to roll their eyes, that's what's going to happen, because this is not being done in the Democratic Party. the people in the democratic party, the people vote in the democratic party, they are not operating on for uh, they are not operating as an expression of working class interest, they're working on what they perceive to be behalf of working class interests, they are, they are stooping to they are condescending inherently, because even if they are, they are struggling themselves, they're struggling in a context where they assume they're part of a middle class by virtue of their education, and then not connected culturally to those people, they just aren't, and that means that nothing within the the democratic party is I think realistically going to blow out and grow out and and increase the share of of those uh working class voters, it's going to get some of them, but I think the the the it will not change the uh drift, because this is all about big numbers and about drift over time, it's not going to change the trajectory. what might happen is that working people might realize that they can fucking organize their workplaces, the ones that still have workplaces, and then because they live in America and they know that this is a political country and they've realized oh shit voted. yeah, that's the next step, because they're not going to go to revolution, I'm sorry, nobody's going to skip this, if you're like, hey, maybe I can do politics and there's an option of voting and maybe doing things without having to get your head cracked open, most people are going to take it, so just yelling at them that it's not going to work and that you're being sheep dip into electoralism isn't going to work, because everyone's going to take the ballot over having to fucking shoot somebody or get shot, because they don't have any assumption it's going to work, they have not been conditioned as the people who believe in that, those vanguard partiists, they have not condition to believe that, they have not come around to the realization that electoralism is useless, they have to come to that realization, so they're going to try, sorry, and that means they're going to build a party and it's going to have people w like went to college in it, but not coming down from above as organizers, maybe a media figures might inspire, not me for christ sake, not nearly famous enough, but maybe somewhere down the line somebody in like will uh run some sort of third party insurgeent campaign that golvinizes people uh and and like a party will emergement spontaneous, from the working class, it will not be a spontaneous like anarchist organization, it will be structured as a lenonist party should be, i think, and it would come from the intersection between a working class and like an emergent party uh activist base organically. now i'm not saying that will happen, and i would infact still say it is highly unlikely that it even gets off the ground, let alone has any chance of successfully challenging for. I do think though that if there is going to be something that emerges from those grassroots I talked about the other day, that's the form it will take, it will have to be a new party, an explicit working class party that does not emerge from some split with the democrats and is not constituated at the top level by democratic operatives or democratic politicians, so is that still i guess? is that black pill? is that brown pill? i've at least expressed you know a possibility. um, but you know, a lot of people who hear third party, their assistance, their spinker wraps up and mine did too, like that's one of the big reasons i kind of rolled my eyes of people got mad at Bernie for not running third party. it's like, this system is designed for two parties, it's it cannot be broken. the constitution itself, necescitates it uh, and so i said, forget about it. but there is a historical precedent that might give some hope that things might be a little different and that would be hilariously enough the republican party. now the republican party emerged not from the uh breakup of the wigs and that's one thing that we're not going to have uh on our favor. i don't think the democrats are going to break up anytime soon. uh, but the wigs broke up because the wigs like the democrats for years were a party that was brought that was uh broadly uh national although there were far fewer wigs in the south than there were in the north but there were wigs in the south uh whereas the democrats were more uh numerous in both places because while they made up the the gentry and the uh labor and the white uh peasantry of the south they made up the urban working class of the north as well. uh whereas like the small holders were generally the small holding uh like craftsman uh in were split between the parties uh and and the uh wigs were largely the part party party of work the emergent middle class the emerging classes in the cities the people worked in the uh the new like protocapitalism uh and uh you know staffing things the the rude mechanics and and or not mechanics were were uh were actual laborers, but uh, mudsills, i guess they were called, like clerks, the kind of people that the southern aristocrats despised, that that was the wig party, the wigs and the democrats both had a policy for years of just ignoring the sectional question of slavery because they were didn't want it to lead to a fucking civil war uh and that was okay because it wasn't a salian issue to people and the... democratic party in the north was largely bereft of anti-slavery sentiment for a long time because for northern workers um and and northern farmers slavery was a material issue, it was they didn't really care one way or the other because it wasn't happening there or to them uh and since that was the case they really just wanted abolitions to shut up about it so that it didn't fucking lead to a war they didn't want to fight. Right, um, in the middle class, there was opposition to slavery uh, which made the wigs like a less pro- slavery party than the Democrats were, because it had this middle-class base that was that objected to slavery on ideological grounds, slavery was bad because it was the enslavement of people, and that drove the conflict for a long time, but then with first annexation of Texas and then bleeding Kansas and uh, the question of slavery and its expansion became material to the workers of the north because everyone sort of understood at a basic level. as Lincoln said, the highest divided against itself could not stand, and that if the sectional tie break was ever broken in the favor of slavery, it meant, it would mean that slavery would become uh uh, it would uh be across the entire country, it would be brought into the north, just as the south was certain that if the uh deadlock in the government broke the other way, which it did in 1860 and caused the session, that they that slavery would be done away with, they were both certain of this, and so once... the uh the balance got threatened by the question of Kansas, the issue of slavery became material to the working class of the north and they said fuck, i don't want to compete with with unfree labor, and so that led to uh pressure within the parties and the first to crack was the wigs, because the wigs were because they were more middle class, more ideologically opposed to slavery, which means their eye on the question got hot hotter, faster. and meant that the uh ability of the wig leadership to hold together the sections became uh uh attenuated and so in the early 18 uh 1850s it uh it broke up and the republicans emerged as a essentially the wig parties platform but explicitly anti slavery and it was originally staffed mostly with former wigs and it competed in the 185 6 election for the first time uh and because it was a new party uh it went for starpower with its nominee, they nominated John C Friemont, the pathfinder, was a very famous explored free bootter who had done uh like uh I think he he explored I think like Colorado and uh so he was essentially a celebrity and third parties love celebrities because they need to get their foot in the door with people and they actually ran in that race against James B cannon and against miller philmore representing the nothings who represented a different breakaway from the from the wigs uh of people who were pissed off about slavery, but even more than that were pissed off about the very existence of the Democratic party and decided that instead of going against the uh the slave power that ran the democrats, they would go against the northern expression of democratic power which was catholic immigrants uh and within four years though, they were gone and the republican party was the party in the north uh because the issue of slavery had become completely salient to everybody, both workers and uh uh uh uh middle class people, and and and the democrats broke up in 1860 and a big chunk of uh democrats in the north still voted for uh the northern democratic choice Stephen Douglas, there was a good uh democrat uh switch the... democrats or I mean switch from Republicans to democrats, but uh, Lincoln mostly won with the X-wig strongholds, and then was able to take advantage of you, Douglas's uh, not being able to get any southern uh, electoral votes, so that you know, that could happen, and what happened during the war is that you have this fusion of... the wig, the republican uh like middle-class opposition to slavery, which was ideological, and then the working class, whose opposition to slavery had been this felt material threat, the idea of having to compete with slave labor, uh, the the the very process of fighting the war and defeating slavery, brought them to sort of a synthesis and by the end of the war, there was a broad understanding, even among the largely racist working class of the north, that's slavery was an evil, it wasn't just a threat to free labor, it was an inherent evil of itself, and that it needed to be stamped out, tragedy of reconstruction, the reason it failed is because rather than because these republicans who at the leadership position were uh the democrats of their day, in that they were middle-class people or wealthier, would absorbed middle class values, not through college necessarily, although a lot of them had, but is through the drawing room propriety of life in these you know well-healed urban areas and their opposition to slavery was always that of the um of the estete and that means that they did not connect it to a deeper issue, the way that like a working class person could connect to the deeper issue and connect slavery to the concept of wage slavery of connect like compelled labor to his his life of of exploited labor uh and so when the war ended capitalism in the south did not end, this the plant plantations went back uh uh the cotton got extracted again the slave the the former slaves were were rehired uh uh and and the poor southerners were forced. to pick up the pieces while the uh planter class was reestablished because these uh these former wigs didn't really have any interest in transforming the means of production and and and heightning you know the the conflict with capitalism the way that like the German idealistts like my boy August Vilitch and Joseph Weedemier hoped it would and that possibility that that moment we had after the civil war of like a a a a a coalition of uh of this militant. uh working class, these people who fad fought the war to end slavery, the former slaves themselves and maybe even the fucking former uh, you know, white uh, smallholders, the fucking dirt farmers of the south who had nothing their entire lives could have been brought together in a project of uh of of of liberation, I'm not saying that would have happened, it's still, it's very unlikely, but in any world where it could have happened, Abraham doesn't get assassinated, I will say that, but even if he doesn't get assassinated, the overall. of the fact that the wig party which drove the the the caboose of the republican party that became hegemonic in the post war world was not fundamentally working class and therefore did not have any interest in furthering the conflict with capitalism and in fact reinscribed capitalism and just instituted the wig program which was Hamiltonian developmentalism uh but in the context of the massively accumulated capital that had emerged from uh from the civil war itself which created an industrial beheemeth that destroyed uh that became this oppressive force on the the broad working class and and that is why you don't want to see the democrats doing any of this because if they're riding the thing it'll be another middle class uh exercise in aesthetic morality uh but there are examples of things like that emerging and i'd say the populist party is probably the closest we've ever seen to something uh becoming the coming just sort of sweeping out uh through uh like mutual uh mutual cooperation in the face of exploitation and uh hardship but eventually they were absorbed into the the the platform uh of the democratic party which is kind of inevitable uh but honestly, I got to say, the democrats could collapse like a house of cards, I mean not, it's not in like some of these suburbs, but I think that uh, that their failure is going to be pretty dramatic, and a lot of people who are very keed up right now are going to be very, very mad, and I don't know where it goes, like I said, it probably doesn't go anywhere, but it might. go, it might go to somewhere, and if it does, it'll be an emergent party, I'd say, because that's how people are going to express themselves in America, that's what, that's what politics will mean to people who are being brought into it, not by book learning, but by lived experience and cooperation, and if we could do that, we might finally have a party that the post war republican party could have been, and there a lot of people like Marks and certainly willitch hoped it would be, which is the... of uh labor that would have in my best case scenario for a more successful reconstruction have gotten rid of the US constitution and refound and created a new refonded American political structure that would abolish federalism entirely, I think that that any hope we had to not be on this trajectory would have required that, and I really do think that like I said, there's no guarantee it would have worked, it probably wouldn't have, i think that the uh assassination of Lincoln is one of those rare, contingent and consequential moments in American history, but if we ever got a party, it would be a party that will take up the banner that the republicans should have held, which was to take the war against slavery and continue it against wage slavery, the way that bukaren wanted to take the red army after uh the after world war one uh and turn it into a people's army against uh western uh imperial capitalism, the difference uh, but it didn't happen, and honestly one of the big reasons was that... after five years of war, people were fucking tired. um, what we need, the way this is going to happen, like I said, I don't know what they look like in terms of real structure or specifics, but if it occurs, it'll be because people have, enough people will have found a way to motivate themselves towards a collective good through a no, not through reason. not by logic, not in order to uh performatively demonstrate virtue to other people and alleviate themselves of their own anxiety about their class position and the amount of exploitation that they uh that they uh benefit from in this world, but because they truly believe that their lot is tied with others to such an extent that that they can abnegate their own uh narrow interests uh and it's to that point I would like to read something that uh, one of my favorite people in American history, Eugene Debs wrote in his the socialist newspaper appeal to reason in 1907 about John Brown and the need for the spirit of John Brown to return. I want to say before that I read this that when I say we need like John Brown as an example as I have talked about. I do not mean any of the violence they carried out, which is what people like, let's be real, people like John. because he cut the heads off of slavers, and they think of John brown and they imagine themselves like beheading a proud boy and they feel like their this violent fantasy that they have is virtuous, that's that's what it is, and I'm not talking about that, like I think anybody who's observed America knows that like any kind of exemplary violence is not going to motivate any sort of titanic conflict, it's only going to be absorbed as entertainment and as content the way that everything else is. so not talking about violence, I'm talking about a spirit of commitment. John Brown's violence was in the context of a strategy of ending civil of of slavery, which was broadly correct in that he saw that there was a standoff between sides in which night uh no one on the north cared about slavery enough to uh commit enough to create a genuine point of conflict with the south. the south was pretty confident up until bleeding Kansas that they would just eventually take over the government uh they they they were on and because there was an asymmetricy asymmetry of interests in the south you had an entire working moving working - an entire ruling class devoted to slavery at a fundamental level a culture wealth everything was about slavery and a white society that was all built around slavery in the lowlands anyway in the in the surprisingly in the hills where there waren't plantations there was a lot less slavery and weirdly a lot less support for the confederacy during the war some reason, i don't know what it is, um, but in the north, like i said, it was largely, i just don't want slaves competing with me for labor, you had some abolitions, those wigs i was talking about, and and people who were too hardcore for the wigs, like the liberty party people and the free soilers, who said, no, fuck you, uh, let's end this thing, but they were always considered annoying, like northern democrats hated abolitionists because they thought they were fucking they were going to create a war that they didn't want to fight because they didn't care about slavery. but as the sec as the uh question of expansion became more central and the the investment of the south in expanding slavery and therefore expanding their control over government became more powerful, that changed the math in the north, but not enough to make anyone cross the fucking boundary, because at the end of the day it was abstract to people, it was not abstract to john Brown or the people who rode with him, it obviously wasn't abstract of black people either, but they had very limited power to influence white people's decision making. John brown could go to Kansas and do violence that that broke away from the the stailmate that that uh that galvanized the free soil factions in Kansas, at that point had basically been backing down to the Rufians at every point and made them fight and the fight made everyone realize that they what they were willing to do and brought about the conflict. There's nothing like that in the current moment, there's no violence you could. admit that would have that result, all violence would be absorbed, fucking Stephen paddock shot 70 fucking people uh to death from the top of a building and it was the fifth biggest story of the month, there's no amount of violence you can do uh that will have any effect, not even it'll be negative effect, i'm not even going to say don't do it, i mean yeah if you kill people that's bad probably, i mean they probably didn't have a coming, especially if it's just because they have the wrong opinions about something, but my god which is what it would really be, you're not going to go. and fight real power, you're going to find somebody who said something you don't like on twitter, shoot him or something like that, because that's what really matters to people, that's what they really care about. um, what i mean is that? spirit of non-abstract commitment as a life, and like I have said, I am not that person, I mean, I see, I would like to be, and maybe someday I will find a situation where I am like able to believe enough that the thing I could do in front of me would mean something meaning, that would like that would justify any any sacrifice, but I think that that spirit is necessary, and I think that it's going to be, I mean, I don't think it's not going to happen. I don't think it doesn't occur, I don't think it's not out there everywhere in the hearts of millions of people, it's a question of whether it'll spark in the right places and among the right people where where the rolling ball of humanity can like gather, and and like I said when I talk about how atomized we are and how we are all consumers and how we can't even think politically, like that was a huge huge, huge problem, like Brown Brown activated in an era where politicization of life was much more uh uh taken was much more uh uh material, it was it was the spectacle of politics much much much less a component of people's understanding of their politics, but if we're going to do anything that's going to be, we're going to do anything except like volunteer to be a fifth column when the fucking Chinese army shows up, uh, that's what we have to keep our eyes out for, as I've said, just keep away, so we'll close here with this from the appeal to reason, November 23rd, 1907, the most picturesk character, the bravest man and most self-sacrificing... soul in American history was hanged in at Charleston Virginia, December 2nd, 1859. On that day said, some 1800 years ago Christ was crucified. This morning per chance, Captain Brown was hung. These are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not old brown any longer, he is an angel of light. I forsee the time when the painter will paint that scene, no longer going to Rome for a subject, the poet will sing it, the historian record it, and with the landing of the pilgrims and the declaration of independence, it will be the or. of some future national gallery, when at least the present form of slavery shall be no more here, we shall then be at liberty to weep for Captain Brown, few people dared that on that faithful day to breathe a sympathetic word for the grizzled old agitator, for years he had carried on his warfare against chat slavery, he had only a handful of fanatical followers to support him, but to his mind his duty was clear, and that was enough, he would fight it out to the end, and if need be, alone. Old John Brown set an example of moral courage and... of single-hearted devotion to an ideal for all men and for all ages. with every drop of his honest blood he hated slavery, and in his early manhood he resolved to lay his life on freedom's altar in wiping out that unsufferable affliction. he never faltered, so god like was his unconquerable soul that he dared to face the world alone. how perfectly sublime? he did not reckon that overwhelming numbers against him, nor the pultry few that were on his side. this grosser aspect of the issue found no lodgement in his mind. heart, he was right, and Jehovah's was with him, his was not to reckon consequences, but to strike the immortal blow and to step from the gallows to the throne of God. Not for earthly glory to John Brown Wage his holy warfare, not for any recognition or reward, the people had it in their power to bestow. His great heart was set upon a higher goal, animated by a loftier ambition, his grand soul was illuminated by a sublimer ideal, a race of human beings, loly and despised were in chains and this festering crime was eating out the heart of... civilization, in the presence of this awful plague, logic was silent, reason, dumb, pityy, dead, the let wrath of retributive justice, long asleep, awakened at last and hurled its luurid bolt. Old John Brown struck the blow and the storm broke, the ch that hour chat slavery was dead. In the first fightful convulsion, the slave power seized the grand old liberator by the throat, put him in irons and threw him into a dungeon to a wait execution. Alas, it was too late, his work was done, all Virginia could do was to... "John Brown is grander than George Washington, history may be searched in vain for an example of noble heroism and sublime self sacrifice equal to that of Old John Brown, from the beginning of his career to its close, he had but one ideal and one ideal, and that was to destroy shadow slavery, and in that cause he sealed his devotion with his noble blood. Realizing that his work was done, he passed serenely, almost with joy from the scenes of man." his calmness upon the gallos was aw-inspiring, his excellation supreme. Old John Brown is not dead, his soul still marches on and each passing year weaves new garlands for his brow and adds fresh luster to his deathless glory. Who shall be the John Brown of wage slavery? I would just like to note also, John Brown was not uh, he was not a uh middle-class wake, he was a broke uh... about stockman and farm farm farmer, he did not learn the wrongness of slavery in the parlors of good society, he learned it in his heart, and that's where everything has to come from. If it comes from a desire to be perceived as good, as if it comes from a desire to justify one's social position, and and and purge oneself of the guilt associated with the exploitation inherent in their position, it will, it can go to no good. All right guys, bye-bye.
