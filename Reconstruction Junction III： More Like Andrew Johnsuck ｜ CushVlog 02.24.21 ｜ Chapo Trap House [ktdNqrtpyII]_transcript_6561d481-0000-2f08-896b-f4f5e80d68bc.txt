 so me what you doing now baby baby show what doing now oh is it working like first first shots this is amazing wow that's just popped out on great feeling good about it feeling good in the neighborhood applebees is applebees gone are they all gone what happened where are the chain restaurants of yesteryear cuz they were all on very shaky footing before. for COVID, I can't imagine many of them are still around unless they're going to get bailouts, which would be very funny if there was some sort of like Chile's bill where chilis is all in capital letters, the Chile's bill and it's all money for chain restaurants, buse honestly like what are you going to do for people for whom going to those chain restaurants really is a social event, the closest thing they have to one anyway, I mean it's what replaced the Koanas club and uh and the elks and and and VFW is going to fucking uh applebeas, neighborhood bar and grill, that's what they call it. uh, yeah, I know they got the PPP money, but I mean I think they're going to need more, they're going to need even more, they want to uh, keep, keep that, keep it going, because even before uh, the collapse of uh, the retail sector and dining, they weren't doing. all right, 500 episodes, can you believe it folks? what a long, strange trip it's been, Gerald Garcia, ah, it isn't dude, a very weird and disturbing universe we inhabit, isn't it? it certainly is. how the hell we get five goddamn 100 episodes out of this thing? i have no idea, we'll see how many more we get, i hope it's a lot, 500 more, why not? just become a permanent fixture in the podcasting universe, still be a podcast when they turn into brain implants, courtesy of elon musk, that'd be pretty fun, huh? okay, uh, getting up here, all right, so let's start talking about chapter. three and four or chapters four and five rather of reconstruction by Eric Fanner uh so the first the fourth the fourth chapter uh the about is about the re the attempt by reconstruction authorities to impose a free labor standard uh on the former south which uh had a lot of problems as you could imagine uh and I want to start with the hilarious little uh anecdote that Foner fins in here that so the basic fundamental reality that all of this attempt to struck create free uh labor institutions in the south contracts and all that all that was based on one fundamental fact which was not assured to happen which could have gone otherwise this is why i fixate on uh uh the notion of contingency and the idea that the reconstruction could have done gone differently is that all of this uh that we're going to talk about these chapters is premised on the uh the wholesale pardoning basically of the confederate uh elite the the slaveholding class which is about 200,000 people who uh who brought about the war through their own choice were responsible for the war uh and were given a pass by Andrew Johnson where said, go back to your land, you get your land back, we'll even give you back your political rights, if you sign a little thing saying that you're loyal or whatever, uh, and then even if and if you made a lot of even if you were one of the most elete, you can get a pardon uh, if you ask me nicely, literally, they had a provision if you had more than $20,000 in property, you had to ask for a personal pardon from the president, which Johnson started handing out. like uh fucking hot cakes as soon as they started asking for them, so the the upshot of all of this is that the slave, the ruling class gets to maintain or try to reasert anyway, some of them had difficulty uh, and when they found their uh, their plantations ruined and their their uh, their confederate uh bonds worthless, but a lot of them were able to maintain their land and maintain their influence, and a lot of them fixated on the idea of just going back to the way things used to be, uh, and one of the ways they did that according to Fanner was uh by... going back and recreating the uh the high chevalric feudal cause play that characterized southern society uh Mark twain actually when rewrote about the confederacy he had been a uh he was mussterd into a Missouri confederate unit early in the war and then quickly deserted uh and then after the war was very critical of the confederacy uh and southern society in general and he blamed the war on Walter Scott. he said that uh that all of that uh romantic feudal uh uh fantasy got into the heads of the planter elite and proving that the uh claim that they were like the burbons after uh the return the fall of Napoleon uh who were said to have come back having forgotten nothing and learned nothing which is why the reactionary democrats uh who took over uh south the southern party uh after the war were called burban democrats uh they were in they were committed to trying to act like nothing had changed even though they just got their asses kicked in the entire country their country was burned to the ground uh they staged chivalrick tournaments tournament straight out of Ivanhoe complete with knights adorned with lances and plumed helmets and ladies competing to be crown queen of love and beauty made an incongruus reappearance although in one in one north carolina community, the cult medieval nobility waiined after blacks organized the tournament association of their own. so here you see the the the conflict, the conflict that would define reconstruction, a planter or one of them anyway, a planter elite trying to reassert the old way of being with the fact of a free black population uh uh making it impossible or at least making it much more difficult than they would have liked, because how special is it, how is how special is your fancy little tournament if if if your former slaves can run around and pretend to be galloping uh dipshits the same way. so one of the big uh impacts of the the abolition of slavery and uh the abolition of the plantation model was the end of plantation paternalism uh which was the by any stand it was the the uh the one sort of saving grace of the plantation uh slavery model uh economic model relative to northern wage labor which is that in the northern wage labor system if you were not of economic use to capital bye-bye you had you were not no one was obliged to you in any way and if you didn't have family who could take care of you you were jwf jolly well fucked uh in whatever else you want to say about slavery and it was of course monsterous beyond measure uh ageed slaves slaves who could no longer work in the in the fields were taken to be sort of the uh the the the uh their um maintenance their their lie their uh sustentenance was the responsibility of the slave owner and the slave owners thought well at the end of the war well if if there's no more, if there's no gratitude on the part of the slaves, which they insanely thought there should have been, uh, and there's no um, and there is no obligation, then I have no obligation to uh the slaves either, and so things that used to be part of a plantation uh, complement, like food, and shelter were charged for, and uh, and slaves the couldn't work, were not anybody's responsibility, but the markets. the prob and of course for uh for northerners they might look at that and say fine that's great fun finally free labor associations not this quasi feudal arrangement but the thing is is that the assumption underlying the free labor institutions of the north which they were trying to impose on the south was a civic equality. where market transactions could take place in, which the uh the the white southern society was committed above all else to refusing to allow to occur. so that's another one of the conflicts that uh that the northern authorities who are trying to administer reconstruction really kept finding baffling they were trying to give people the chance to to live as Americans as they did in the rest of the country and these southerners they just refused to go along with it and they just could not understand why uh on the on the part of uh freed slaves, there was a real uh desire to access that yoman vision of freedom, the the vision by the way, that was Abraham Lincoln's presiding vision for American liberty, the idea that because of the because the idea that access to land allows the American citizen liberty from the market. liberty most importantly from the uh the compulsion of wage labor, wage labor might be a station in life, but in Lincoln's fantasy of how America was supposed to work, and how it kind of did work in places like his springfield in Illinois, uh, which is what, which is the concept that Richard White begins his book with, laying out springfield and saying, this was Lincoln's vision for America, uh, what that required was, uh self-sufficiency in land, access to land so that one could make make money in the market, but also sustain themselves on the land, meaning that they could save money, choose employers as they saw fit, not as the market dictated, and that they could save money to improve their the amount of land that they held, and that was something that many, many former slaves were dying to fucking try to access, but uh that but one thing that stopped them was Johnson administration's refusal to redistribute land, the single biggest catastrophe of the Johnson uh presidential reconstruction era uh and also the fact that for the former slave owners the only social uh value of the black population was as labor for them, the the idea of blacks being independent yoman was totally anathema, because that would imply that they were members of a community, members of a society. which was absolutely uh, not what they wanted, if they needed, if they were to exist, they were to exist for the benefit of owners, for the benefit of of of employers now, instead of uh masters, and this is a thing that northerners quept running against and being baffled by uh, and it was funny, so so many northerners actually came to the south, bought land, tried to create their own... plantations motivated by the belief that uh that if you gave uh uh former slaves and the market incentives that they would produce profits for you uh through cotton cultivation uh but it over and over again uh the former slaves resisted being used as uh profit making for someone else which they knew instinctively it was the relationship uh because they had only encountered at their entire life in in favor of sustenance and in favor of working land for their own families benefit, not for the profit that they knew they would never see uh and that became a big problem for a lot of northerners and for a lot of northerners it confirmed the uh stereotypes that they had heard from former slave owners that you we have you have to have a system of compulsion of labor in place or otherwise they won't work, the blacks won't. work, and the fact was they won't work for you at your um, on your dictates, which was enough to throw them into furor, because they could not see any other social utility to the very existence of these people, if they were not there to provide surplus for the ownership class, which uh, and a lot of those uh northerners were baffled because they thought, no, no, no, things are different, now it's different, now now we're we're collaborating. "you're not, I'm not your master, I'm I'm your employer," and they were baffled by the fact that that former slaves didn't have that motivation to see their bank uh balances expanded, and I and that big reason for that is that free labor ideology that the north was trying to impose on the south was premised on a notion of civic equality that obscured the reality of class conflict, because even in the..." and accepted by many people in a false consciousness because of things like um civic equality because people were all considered to be within one uh unit like if you had uh if you had land you could vote but uh black suffrage was completely rejected by these early reconstruction southern governments and so and black skin was was uh socially prescribed from huge areas of of social intercourse and so in a very... real way uh black people, former slaves, especially the south were demystified about, they were they did not have the the uh inculcated illusions that the culture of of uh civic democracy in the north had allowed to spread, and uh there was a very considered effort among the friedman's bureau uh and the specifically the uh educational institutions that they sponsored throughout the south for the former slaves to inculcate on into the former slaves and their children, uh, the value, the idea of uh, the idea that class con conflict could be alighted and transcended through education and self-improvement, which was an endemic belief in the north, but that just could not be sustained in the face of the social reality of the south. And they were doing this to... they were the the friedman's bureau was frantically trying to get this message out there in large part because uh the people in charge of the friedman's bureau which was a revolutionary institution in that it was doing things that the United States government at the time was saw essentially as anathema in any other context the sort of direct provision of of help uh poor relief was considered uh offensive to free institutions at the time because of the... the pervasiveness of this free labor ideology uh, and so the uh bureau was wildly underfunded, understaffed, and even the people who did staff it were largely interested first and foremost in reducing the need for their uh, for the institution to exist, they were trying to undermine their own remit as quickly as possible so that they could uh, so that they could stop this transgression against. free contracts and and liberty uh as quickly as possible and very few people were willing to recognize that the reality of emancipation and the reality of this new class war in the south necessitated a changing relationship between governing institutions and the citizenry, but even the disearnest desires of the freedom's bureau to eliminate themselves were stimied not really so much by the former slaves. who did of course come to the friedman's bureau and saw it as really one of the only institutions that had even could potentially uh uh give them justice since all local courts and uh and legal institutions were arrayed against them and were completely packed with bitter former confederates uh but it was the fucking former confederates themselves uh the the Johnson and the freedom's bureau gave the south back to their planter elite on a platter on the condition that do something to try to uh institute a free labor system in the south and they fucking refused, they look, they didn't only look at the mouth, they pissed that in its teeth, and the one thing that the freeman's bureau did that might have actually created a a situation where where there would have been a basis for the enduring establishment of black political power in the south, which was necessary, because was necessary to change conditions and to truly um uh fulfill the revolutionary implications of the civil war, because you know the interests and passions of the north were always going to be short-lived relatively because of the lack of their personal investment in the outcome. uh, it was going to be, it was going to be only through the uh, the intensification of black political uh power. would have asserted on the ground uh uh black equality and the thing that could have done that was land was ownership of land and the freeman's bureau did actually in the very immediate aftermath of the war begin a program uh of land redistribution not only was land that had been claimed by uh former slaves from abandoned uh plantations and such codified as owned by them but uh land that had given to slaves as a war exigency by Sherman for example marching through South Carolina was ratified and also uh General Oliver O-Howard issued circular 33 which set which was the one of the basises for the 40 acres in a mule notion that that's set aside or or plan to set aside 40 acre tracks for freeedman to cultivate on their own and if that had been followed through on and intensified uh you that I think is really the chance for uh reconstruction to have taken a different turn and for American history to have taken a different turn uh and Andrew Johnson motherfucker uh single-handedly and against all of the momentum that was happening on the ground in the south uh cancelled all redistribution ordered all slaves ex- slaves off of land that they had uh taken or had been off uh given uh fired and reassigned all uh commanding officers in the union army who were committed to land redistribution which was not none there were several radical generals who were ' committed to a project of land redistribution who were assigned or removed from from power when they resisted uh Johnson's order and this really is this is the the the bad turn and I know a lot of people want to be cynical about Lincoln and there's plenty of reason to be so uh but I just honestly do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have done that more than anything because the notion of uh freedom in America being the freedom to... his political uh hero was Henry Clay and Johnson's was Andrew Jackson and I don't think that you can say that going from one to the other in the middle of this incredible moment of ferment had no impact on anything I it just doesn't make sense they now. "you can say, well, it might have gotten, they it might have been rolled back anyway, but the fact is there was no force in the south who could have made it go away at that time, the land was in the hand of the former slaves, they were tilling it, the union army was supporting their claims, then the president said, stop it, the president said that, not really under pressure from anybody else, not part of any ground swell of support in congress as an individual decision, he decided." to do that, so even if the pressures to break up uh the redistributed land would have emerged, they would have emerged later in a atmosphere where the continued tendency on that land would have would have built the power to resist it, that's the thing that people forget when you you when they talk about these things mechanic mechanistically, well all these all the racism was still there, these institutions are still there. Yeah, but as soon, but if the the reality on the ground is different, then the uh, incentives are different and the balance of power changes over time, and I think a situation where uh, ex slave uh, access to land was not stopped, or would have it would have not only stayed where it was, it would have accelerated, because it would have solved a lot of the problems of reconstruction from the point. view of the northern authorities, the persistent violence and and the the uh the persistent need for Friedman's bureau uh um intervention to to provide food and supplies and and uh and uh legal aid for former slaves, it would have reduced the workload, they wanted to reduce the workload, and blacks being able to sustain themselves on the land would have helped them do it, but instead of that being allowed to ferment, it was stopped, and not just stopped, they were, it wasn't like they didn't just say no more, they sent the army out to pull people off the land, people who resisted, people said, no, that's not fair, we fucking cultivated this land, it's ours and who believed that things might change with the new congress, they were forcibly removed, and that to me is the i don't see that happening in any context without Johnson. President, but I think it's we need to point out again, uh, one of the most interesting things about uh, about the contradictions that are built into reconstruction, and one of them is is that the fundamental liberal ideology of... basically everybody from the north who went to reconstruct the south in the image of the north was that the interest of capital and labor are identical, they believe that and like... I said, it was the yoman fan, it was the yoman land access that made that fantasy viable, the idea that yes, you might have to work in a in a factory, you might have to work for somebody else, but you can always get land and work at yourself too, which meant that you could choose the uh uh the conditions of your employment, because you could always just grow turns, that was the fundamental thing, but it was still even with that, a fiction, because access to land is not equal, obviously, access to materials are not equal, luck is not evenly distributed, in fact it tends to accree to people who already have resources in land, but it was a fiction that was maintained by the reality of social mobility, which was real uh as well as the racial solidarity of the white north and the idea uh at which uh honestly more than anybody uh John C Calhoon was the most perceptive about his entire argument for slavery was, as long as there is a subject race, then all whites and regardless of their social position, will see themselves on the same side, and that will obviate the inherent class tensions that would othermize emerge, because calhoon uh Hofstedder has an has had an article uh about Calhoon called the marks of the master class, because he said that Calhoon's analysis of class conflict was the... same as marx is that it was the basis for society and then it was inevitable, but Calhoon said that racialism a racialized society allows that class conflict among whites to be uh obscured and it did uh and then let's not forget national identity, nationalism, the idea that you're an American, that you're part of an American project, that you have a vote, that you can involve yourself in the political process, these things obscure and mystify the reality of the of the basic fact of class conflict. but a war between, and it really was a war, uh, over resources, over contracts, over conditions of work between ex-masters and ex- slaves, was classboard unmasked, because the ex- slaves did not have access to any of those mystifying social relationships of nationalism, of racial solidarity, to obscure the reality of class conflict, and it was very much in the interest of the freedom's Bureau and everyone amongst the northern uh to get away, find a way to get that mask on, to remask that class conflict, which honestly is one of the factors that would have been most crucial in motivating genuine land redistribution, because as I said, access to land was the syniquinon of yoman freedom, and guys like Lincoln understood that more than anyone, and I want to end uh the discussion of chapter four with a quote, a long quote, from uh the end of it uh thus began the forging of a new class structure to replace the shattered world of slavery, an economic transformation that would culminate long after the end of reconstruction in the consolidation of a rural proletariat, composed of the descendants of the former slaves and white yowen, and of a new owning class of planters and merchants itself subordinate to northern financiers and industrialists. now just stop here to say: uh Eugene Jennevis was uh in the 60s was a marxist historianho studied the culture of plantation slavery. He wrote a book called roll Jordan Roll which was very influential in sort of the cultural history of the Annabel south uh and he turned into a neo-conservative like many did after the failure of the 60s revolutions when he decided I guess that the marxist nostrubs the marxist teleology was a fantasy and that capitalism was essentially inevitable and when that happened he looked back on his writings about the the annabel south and decided, you know what, this was superior, this was better than what came later, and honestly if those are your two options, I don't think it's necessarily correct, but it's arguable, but the thing is, it was not inevitable, and this is what uh, this is what emphasizes here in this section, the historian however must have... avoid telescoping the actual course of events into a pre-determined linear progress. both planters and freedmen viewed labor relations as a shifting conflict on a terrain whose victories and defeats remained provisional, and trial and error altered each groups perceptions of its own self-interest. a new set of labor arrangements did not spring up overnight and there was no pre-ordained outcome to the workings of what a federal treasury agent agent described as the new system of labor, if system it may be called, when there is endless confusion and absurd. contradictions, so here you see, looking backward, this is all the civil war itself just looks like the war of a victory for the northern the Yankee leviathan of finance capital. but it did not any point have to be that and I really do think that the killing of Lincoln helped, but was not the only thing on obviously that helped shape us in the direction we went and uh and so for the rest of that chapter talks about how there was this contest over conditions of work over what a contract would look like over how uh over how land would be cultivated uh and at every point uh the ex- slaves uh, they knew the power of group negotiations, like the a plantation, the a former plantation workforce would would essentially um, would bargain with their former owners, as a unit, would in fact sometimes have internal democratic discussions over what sort of contract to take, and then and then stick to it, this was like a proto organized labor uh among uh the former slaves and there were a bunch of different conditions that different contracts uh uh different wage scales now of course the lack of hard currency and the ground meant that very little of the uh of these very few of these newly freeed slaves who are now supposed to be working for wages actually got wages because there was not very much money or credit to be had then they were given an agreement of a percentage of the sale of the cotton generally at the end of the season which of course was right for abuse and and um and thievery and which the remedying of which was one of the main uh roles that the freedom's bureau had was to stand up for the interests of uh the laborers in these negotiations uh and there was actually a period at the beginning of reconstruction when uh the very high price of cotton uh allow and and the huge shortage of labor because of the number of women and children who were pulled out of the workforce by into a domestic spear uh and the increased mobility of slaves to move of former slaves to move away from areas where there was a bad deal to areas where there was a good deal, it actually allowed for uh some pretty good arrangements which were backed up by the federal government to be had and some actual money to be made uh, but of course uh there was then a series of catastrophically bad uh harvests and then a collapse of global cotton prices which severely reduced uh the ex- slaves bargaining position and uh change their ability to uh assert themselves. the other thing that really helped them or that really hinder their ability to assert themselves uh in the years after the war uh was every decision made by motherfucking Andrew Johnson. so let's turn now to chapter five which is about which we we've gone now from the first uh four chapters which sort of are a social uh broads look at the social terrain of the former confederacy to um a analysis of Andrew Johnson and his uh choices, his administration's decisions during the first years of the war. uh, thanks to the amazingly arcain nature of American presidential and congressional elections, uh, there was a period after Lincoln's assassination when Johnson essentially governed completely by himself, because Congress would not be coming back into session until December of 1966, which meant he was in the early months of reconstruction, most crucial months, free to essentially do whatever he wanted, which is what is now called presidential reconstruction. So let's start with a uh, portrait of Andrew Johnson, who is really a quintessance of all of the worst elements. American populism, he is in the grand tradition, as I said, his uh, his political hero is Andrew Jackson, he is part of the grand tradition of of of the of the Ruff Hunyoman, hostile to federal power and the prerogatives of of banks and eastern interests, but also because he was never, because he unlike John Jackson did not become a wealthy uh plantation owner himself, invenerately hostile to the interest of the local. elite and his status as a unionist was premised more than anything on resentment of the fancy boys who ran Tennessee, who look down on uh upcountry uh uh poor people like Johnson who had risen from being a a Taylor's apprentice to being a senator and a governor, he very much was a sort of a dark mirror image of Abraham Lincoln, they were born very close to one another within the same year. uh, and they both came from poor backgrounds, they both worked themselves up into the ranks of politics, but where Lincoln's ambition was sort of fused to a humane. understanding at some level, Johnson's was completely self-fixated, he his any his populism was entirely generated by personal resentment, and that is the under, that's the problem with populism, as it has been expressed in American history, is that if you don't have a rational analysis of power, which you don't, if you're just some fucking ice rube, and you don't have any kind of emotional. connection to like a broadly construed underclass, which he did not, all you're generated by is all your actions are truly generated, motivated by is resentment, and resentment by itself is it's dirty fuel, it's not going to be uh, it's not going to do the job, it is very much like Trump, there's a straight line really from Jackson to Johnson to Trump, I mean you can throw nixon in there too, but honestly Nixon was much more human. and well, I mean, not humane, my god, what he did in Vietnam, but he was more restrained, I guess than the rest of them, but he was similarly motivated by just a burning churning resentment of power, not really any desire to see power overthrown, and that, and that is where the resistance to global capitalism is coming from now, is pure resentment based, with no solidarity undermining it, or undergiding it, and no intellectual structural analysis of... power that might overturn, rude passions either, because that's the important thing to remember, forget about whether it made him a good or bad person, it made him a bad politician, because Johnson's entire strategy, after the war for his building his own political power because that's what he wanted to do, like Tyler wanted after the death of William Henry Harrison, John Tyler who was a democrat had no connection to the wig program, was motivated by a desire to build a independent political base, basically among southern slave owners. Johnson was trying to sort of do a post-war version of that, which was to raise up the white yowenry who he felt that he represented, once again, not out of solidarity, but simple identification. he was one, they were him. just it's selfish uh narcissism, it's not really a political vision. by restoring power to the planter elite at the expense of the ex- slaves. Now that was doomed, it could not have worked, and we see the result, the result is the restoration of power to the fancy lads who he hated, and the continued immiseration of poor whites, because white poverty did not was not alleviated by reconstruction, it was only deepened and extended, so his even his uh, if you want the most altristic reading, the most politically sophisticated uh reading of his desire, of his motivation to lift up the white po, the poor whites of the south was doomed from the beginning and failed miserably. Jackson was based during nullification. It's the same thing, Johnson had the exact same politics as Jackson, which was wild racism, desire for manifest destiny, inveterate hostility to eastern finance and the federal government, but a maniacal obsession with the notion of the union as indivisible, that's it. So as soon as, so when the planters were reinstated in power. they of course reharness the yomen to their thing, to their rule, they they uh, the only force that was trying to allow any upward mobility for poor whites in the south was the friedman's bureau by and and the reconstruction governments that came later, which tried to do things like create public fucking school systems, which had never existed in the south, because i'm not paying for it, why should i pay for it? my fancy child has a bunch of french tutors come to him, why? would i pay for some grubby white trash to get an education? there the the uh the uh poverty of the of of the white south was entrenched by planter rule and it was perpetuated by the continuation of planter rule after the war. the only thing that could have broken planter power, which he which Johnson claimed to hate was a political uh, a political union a political coordination between the poor whites and the ex slaves, it's the only thing that could have done it, but Johnson was completely blinded by his fanatical racism, and honestly the people who say oh Lincoln was racist too, you you can only think that if you live in the fantasy land of now where racism is like a some sort of soul particulate where you are either completely wash, clean of it because you've seen enough of those instagram fucking uh infographics to be pure. fight of racism or it's all consuming uh I mean Lincoln met just as like a very superficial example Lincoln met uh with a number of... black people over the course of his presidency in the white house, talked to them, Frederick Douglas said, I talked to the man, he did not give, he did not give me any reason to believe that he didn't think me it equal to him, Andrew Johnson refused to meet Frederick Douglas, he would fucking shoot him, shoot black people off of the front porch, he was visserally racist in a way that Lincoln simply was not, and that fucking matters when you're the president, and because of the ideasy of our constitution, you have soul control over the reorganization of an entire fucking chunk. to the country for upwards of a year, so what was presidential reconstruction which he tried to put off to create this new uh political uh coalition of the white yowen, the white, the former planters, and northern republic, northern democrats in order to senstain his power and give him a real term because that's the same, that's the thing that unified him and John Tyler that is... desire to get a term of their own, because it doesn't really count if you were vice president, the guy before you died, you got to get, you got to be elected on your own terms, which is what they both drove their entire presidenties towards and both foundered miserably because neither one of them understood the actual terrain of politics because they had their heads up their fucking asses, so the policies were restoring all the land to the former slave owners, which is obseene and and makes no sense morally. legally, as I pointed out, as a as a former slave pointed out in a section from last week, if you've got the fucking right to take the slaves, you have the right to take the land, obviously, but also to restore political rights to the rebels, uh, and the motivator for that was a insane piece of reasoning that Lincoln was, Johnson was completely fixated on, he was so uh, he was so uh, opposed to the notion of secession, he was so opposed to the idea that you could succeed, the idea that secession was allowed by the constitution, that he asserted that because succession is not possible, then the states never really succeeded, which means there needs to be no reorganization and readmission to the union cuz they never left, which is a perfect logic guy reddit approach to reality, you have this logical uh, in your head that's completely air tight according to you and it has nothing to do with the reality on the ground. somebody uh points out someone at the time said like his thinking about secession is like saying because you're not allowed to murder people that means no one's ever committed murder and so why would you punish someone for murder? you can't murder people like they fucking did it they had their own country for four years they shot a bunch of our guys. so because of that, he issued a blanket amnesty to former confederates, allowed basically everybody who fought with the confederacy back into public service, and this was incredibly important because no one, because political power in the 19th century was powered by patronage, the ability to appoint people to to uh public offices and the people who Johnson allowed to take power in the southern states had the ability to fill basically the entire ranks of... the civic service in all these states, unprecedented patronage power, the kind of patronage power that a different president could have used to suborn uh ascension to say black uh citizenship and uh and uh land redistribution, like hey all you poor whites, i know you're mad about black people uh having land and being able to vote, but who wants to be a fucking postal clerk, who wants who wants to be a justice of the peace that could have been used instead? those ranks were filled up immediately with former confederates. he had a exemption for anybody who owned $20,000 or more worth of property, but as I said, you could get a pardon if you asked nicely, if you send him a letter and asked, and I got to believe that part of the reason he did that, this resent driven freak was that he loved the idea of of the former Taylor, the Ruff Hun Boy from Tennessee, getting all of these begging letters from all these lavender scented Fops, and then he's like, yeah, yeah, but he fucking signed. on these things by the rafter, hundreds a day in some cases, which meant that uh, the former confederates, people who took arms against the country at the highest levels, were back in government very quickly, uh, and the very high levels though, were either, it was taking too long for them to get their uh, their pardons, or they were, they refused to cooperate with the Yankees, so the people who ended up taking power in these new states were a mixture of the kind of upcountry uh poor whites that he was uh who were hostile to uh planter power and had been hostile to planter power before the war uh has to be remembered that this southern states, as much as we like to think that they were passions of liberty for white people, had wildly undemocratic voting structures, in fact there were property requirements not just for voting in some states, but for uh but for and then after property requirements for voting went away over time, but in many of the southern states property requirements to serve in uh government were still in effect and were reasserted after the war by some of these fancy lands. so the people who are opposed to that, they were they were enthrolled in places where there was significant anti-uh confederate unionist sympathy before the war, places like North Carolina and Arkansas, places with mountains basically, places without mountains though, uh, the only real union people, people who were opposed to seccession in 1860, but then probably ended up joining the confederacy anyway, because hey, that's what the state's doing, uh, were X-wigs, uh, Wiggs uh made up a a significant percentage of the the very high... points of the planter elite in the south, the ones who were most connected to finance, the ones were most hostile to even white democracy, and they were the ones who took power in a number of these other states. um, and with this coalition, Johnson hoped to put the war basically behind everybody, hey, let's bygons be bygons and they were going to put it all on the backs of the former slaves and what was going on? motivate that in part was uh white yowen hostility to the blacks which was generated by a very weird belief that a lot of them had uh that it was that slavery was if was black people's fault an equal if not greater amounts than it was their owners that they had a love for their owners and that they actually really only hated freewites now that of course is classic projection because for a poor white uh their social condition is precarious and the the one thing that keeps them on this side of the the social uh fabric is that they're not black and so that means that hatred and hostility uh is all generated on those closest to them in condition which was they're much closer in the condition of their life like day-to-day uh obviously they had a great degree of freedom that blacks didn't, but in terms of the conditions of their housing, the conditions of their labor. they were much closer to slaves than they were to slave owners and so of course the familiarity is what breeds the contempt uh and that was something that Johnson felt and something that he hoped could he could cultivate and give him a new basis for political power. and it might have it might have worked except for the fact that these new uh governments refused to take yes for an answer, refuse to take the offer of look acknowledge the end of slavery and basic civic. freedom, not even asking for something like uh, um, uh, suffrage, and then we can kind of move on, and uh, they all said, fuck you, and what they did was pass a bunch of insanely draconian laws, uh, restricting the freedom of x slaves, what called black codes, restricted their ability to move without uh, without permission, the uh, basically making it illegal for them to not. sign employment contracts every year to be unemployed uh and uh made it illegal for them to congregate anywhere in public and certainly in cities and liable for arrest and and uh transmission to force labor if they were found away from a plantation. essentially what they tried to do was take the private regime of of coersion that had existed under slavery and make it the duty of the state. but the north, that was a bridge too far, even though there was no great commitment to black equality, certainly black suffrage in the north, in fact a number of uh referenda about allowing blacks to vote in northern states were was were uh defeated in 1865 uh this was just just a bridge too far, because the war, the sacrifices of the war, which had been incalculable in the north, maybe the the land had prospered, but the people had died in large numbers, seen their friends and family go off and never come back, it had to mean something, it had to fucking mean something, and the idea that the people who seceded from the union. killed a bunch of their friends and family, fathers and brothers, would go back in power and essentially recreate slavery with a different, with extra steps, as they said on Rick and Morty. was just too fucking much, and it created a backlash to Johnson and to presidential reconstruction, which many northerners supported in the very beginning of his uh administration, that would culminate in the uh creation of radical reconstruction, and I think the fact that you have this political will here to push beyond the status quo ante in the name really of black freedom, a push that would lead to the establishment within a few years of something that nobody really was taking seriously as an idea north or south in 1865 uh uh uh black voting rights to occur and for civil rights to be enacted. that to me indicates that there was some political base for. project that would have been centered on black uh redistribution of plantation land to slaves that could very well have been affirmed and channeled and shaped by a Lincoln administration, it would have led to a greater degree of conflict with the ex uh planters, which very well would have come to violence, but it came to violence anyway, and the question is, maybe it would have come to more productive violence. and so next week, I don't know if it's going to be Wednesday, it might be Thursday, uh, I will figure it out and let everyone know, but there will be a stream next week, I don't think there's going to be a stream tomorrow or Friday, I will uh let everyone know on that, uh, still up on the air, but sometime next week there will be another stream where we talk about five uh, chapters uh, chapters six and seven, yeah, which will be, which will start when Congress finally reconvenes. in December of 1866 with a strong republican majorities in both houses, with a invigorated radical faction willing to confront the president, and uh, all of a sudden a lot of things that didn't seem possible and seemed like lights that were dimming out of existence uh in the summer of 1865 are starting to flame back up again, and as I said, that's why uh, that's why... I think this is worth looking at um, because it didn't have to be this way, I don't think, and if it didn't have to be this way then, then nothing has to be anyway, there's fluidity, there's chance, there are things beyond the dry workings of the market determining human actions and human hearts, so we'll talk about that next week, very frustrating reading the... this week, I'm sure everybody reading, especially the chapter on Johnson was just knowing on their fucking hands the whole time, I know I was, just want to hit him with a brick, uh, but it'll be fun to watch him get his shit owned in the next chapter, because uh, he did not take the emergence of a congressional consensus on reconstruction very well, he essentially pulled a Trump in that he tried to rally support for his vision of reconstruction by a... whistle stop tour of northern cities uh, but in the more rough and tumble, less security fixated world of those politics, he got his shit, he got his shit booed out of town, he got uh, he got cheered, he got, he got whistled at, it's pretty funny uh, and he was drunk most of the time, so we'll talk about that next week, got a few minutes here, if anyone was any questions, anybody has any specific question? about what we've read, but yeah, no, Johnson's worst president of all time, nobody else had the position they were in to dictate things, because plenty of presidents were monsters, but they were monsters who essentially embodied a moment of time rather than shaped it, and i think that is the reality of the American presidency, and why ranking them by goodness or badness is often so arbitrary and beside the point, it really isn't like ranking baseball players, it's like ranking... empires, a president's ability to do good or evil is essentially the luck of where they find themselves in time and their willingness to embody historical forces beyond their control, but there are a few hinge points where individual decision making really is fundamental to outcomes to destiny and Johnson is one of them, someone says even becanon, yes, situation among the dough faces who occupied the presidency before the civil war was essentially untenable, they were trying to hold together a consensus that was breaking apart in front of them, and they had no idea, they were not a equipped uh ideologically, uh, politically, intellectually to deal with it, if you flip James B. Cannon and Franklin Pierce, you have basically the same outcome, I believe, I mean fucking Franklin Pierce, uh, Franklin Pierce supported the confederacy, the motherfucker was from fucking New Hampshire, uh, there they would have just done the same things in that moment, they would have. they they had no where with all to resist secession, they would have facilitated it, because facilitating the slave power was all the northern democrats knew how to do, it was the asinoquinon of power, it was how you got the big chair was by kissing the ass of the south, they do didn't know what else to do, so they all would have done it, Johnson, they were destroyed, they were destroyed and defeated people, and he picked them back up, dusted them off and put them back in charge when it didn't have to happen. It's Johnson, there's no question, yeah, pierce was a big alcoholic, it might have had something to do with the fact that all of his kids kept dying, Even to this day a lot of the president's decisions are on rails, I would argue more than ever. I think one of the reasons that we now have these presidents who seem to only exist to be seen in power and only pursue power for like a narcissistic desire to be seen, is because they all know at a certain level that they don't have any real power or authority to do anything, like obama i intellectually understands that, I think Trump just does it more visserally, but both of them watch themselves be president, I mean, Obama was like writing his memoirs while he was president, like that was the whole point of it was to have memoirs, to have Netflix deals to have a podcast where he can pontificate upon power, not to actually ever be in the room where power is exercised, fucking uh, Trump just tweeted his way, watched tv and tweeted himself through the presidency, both of them aware at a certain level that they actually were not the ones who uh called the shots, and now we got a guy who literally doesn't even know where he is, who just wants to be president because it's all he's ever wanted, and he doesn't even know why anymore, that's it, the guy had two brain hemorages when he ran for president 30 years ago, his life flashed before his eyes, all the things that happened to him happened in a moment, and all it did was further solidify in his freak brain that being president was the only thing that mattered, because it was the only thing i think that could have validated all the horrors of his life, all the awfulness of his existence is if he gets to be president, and now he's done it, and that's it, he gets to wander around the white house, not even knowing what day it is, half the time he probably doesn't even know he's president, that's the hilarious part of it, he probably sits around, he's probably waiting for brock to show up. all right, that was good, i thought we we we did well on that, next week, maybe on friday i'll let you. but next week definitely we'll talk chapters uh six and seven.
