 There's me, hey, I'm on tv, that's fun, huh? Hey everybody, how's everybody doing? Oh yeah baby, lovecraft country, no good, no good, very bad, obviously first minute of it, there's CGI blood thumbs down, it's all CGI so that's already, you have to get over a very large bar to just deal with it because you're a fucking genre show, I don't care if you have prestige trappings. your fucking genre show, that means your effects have to be good, they have to be immersive, they're not, bye-bye, but maybe they could have salvaged that if there was something on top of it that was like textually dense and interesting enough to to make it worthwhile, but in my mind any chance of that happening went out the window, when a montage of uh of racial abuse in the 40s of of white people being racist to black people as they travel across the country was scored to a James Baldwin speech, I believe his debate with Buckley, maybe it might have been. I mean, for one thing that's anachronistic, obviously that happened much later than the events of the film. Secondly, I mean, who are they imagining is watching this? How small, how, what kind of guppy brained children are they pitching this to, where they have to, it's like even though the text of every scene is racism, like the text of every scene is a racial disparity and racial abuse. and I'm not saying that's necessarily bad, but you have to with that, with being that limited at a palette, you have to like keep it interesting and innovative, and just saying like, oh, you know, I usually use music to you know sort of evoke a subtextual thing, we're just going to add more text on top of the text, I mean, what the fuck, it's just to me, I'm just going to assume that you don't, think that I have a brain at that point as a viewer, and so why the hell would I want to watch that? You you, you don't think I'm very bright, and that probably means you're not too smart either, you don't have enough to say, uh, yeah, like being kind of buse that's the thing, it's not like the level of art on the show is really great, being condescended to by a dummy is one of the most infuriating things in life, and that's what that show does, so thumbs down to that, but it also. so but I'll give a credit that show helped spark a real uh a real revelation to me and that was I was I did a tweet about oh the show's got CGI Squibs fuck this and of course a lot of people were like well yes but the show itself is great no wrong incorrect not great uh or they'll say well it's a dream sequence it's it's it's kitchy it's stuff they're all it's all CGI so no that's clearly just the style that's the aesthetic so out out with that uh and then but someone god bless them linked a uh a montage of squibsh uh squib hits from movies that's on youtube and i watched it it was like eight minutes long and i'd seen a bunch of those movies and i was it was kind of fun like picking them out like oh no i know that one i know that one but just watching this this the the the drama of an actual explosion happening on screen and the unpredictable and viscous uh physicality of fake blood coming out of a woound and i was like god damn t really is like why else have somebody get shot in the movie as an aesthetic experience, which is of course what it 99% of the time is, you're not really moving the plot along, you're showing that because you want to see it, and so that's what shooting is for, and i realized my god, like the the gun fight, the gun fight in movies is doomed, like who will ever want to watch people get shot if that's gone, because that's what makes it interesting, that's what makes it visceral as i've said. and the movies that don't have that, they just lose, it's like, oh, okay, this is fake, these are kids playing with fake guns, i don't care anymore, uh, and the and that was a real challenge, i think to hollywood in general, how we going to make gun-based action, which is one of our bread and butter events, still exciting and visually interesting and aesthetically pleasing, when one of the main elements of the aesthetics of gun fights on movies is gone, and the answer was we're going to replace it with physical uh decterity, smoothness of motion, elegance, grace basically, human grace uh to replace the the missing visceral impact of of real squibs, and that's what the john wick movies were did, and the first john wick movie, one of the reasons everyone loved it, i think is because it appeared to solve the problem, it said here, we're going to give you gun fights that aren't going to have the visceral impact of squibs, but are still going to be amazing because of how fast and elegant they are, how how how quickly they happen, you won't even notice that there's no real blood, you won't even notice that they're not really shooting the guns, because it's going to move so fast, and you know what, it worked, i like the first john wick a lot, i think everybody did. holy crap, look at this thing, it was like, now we have a solution, but the thing was, like with any kind of any answer like this, any sort of attempt to patch over a a key artistic uh uh, you know, deficit of of accelerated capitalist cinema, uh, it ends up becoming a cure all and then it no longer works, and i realize this is that now every one of these movies every one of these gun-based action movies has decided, oh that's how going to trick people into thinking this doesn't look bad by having them do kick flips and grab guys by the head and flip them around and then shoot them real close and have and then have it be very like uh very kinetic and it's now that that's every movie the horror of it comes into realization like oh god this sucks like by the time i watch jod with 3 it's like not only is it just repetitive you and having now seen john wick 3 and like when you see john wick that was just movie, you ask people say, oh, well, what about equilibrium? it's like equilibrium was like 20 years ago and it was an isolated movie that a lot of people made fun of at the time, gunkata, it was sort of a joke, and it became a cult classic later, but it did not, it was not the beginner of a totalizing trend, the way that John wick is, and now since every movie is john wick, you see John wick 3 and you're like, oh god, more of this, and now there's going to be two more at least, everyone is going to be, oh fuck, more of this, well everything else just turns into John wick to high, it's like putting sawdust in the fucking uh in the in the flour cuz you want to make more bread then you then you have flour for, that's what they're doing, it's it's fucking it's saudust in the flour, it's uh it's anti-freeze in the wine, it's another way to obscure the just the the the the the the spirititing reality of having every everything that we thought of as like the compensatory cultural superstructure that we could enjoy even as our... are sort of drilled, drained of uh any kind of power over our destinies. no, you don't, that's not even good, that's bad, we can't afford those real bullets, we can't, oh, what a gun that actually fires, you mean real blanks, what okay, you going to pay for that, who's going to pay for it, it's like universal healthcare for movies, and so now it's like, oh yeah, another, but at every level you can't just take something away, you can't just take something away, you have to offer something that's shittier, but still better than without having the thing that's being taken away, and all the flip John wick bullshit is the is the lesser thing now, so I got to say that uh, I'm not anti-Jon Wick, got to be a thumbs down for me for the entire franchise, and you know what, hey, that's the way the cookie crumbles, you got to accept things changing over time. Now action movies are ton as genre horror is next, horror is next, horror is doing a little bit better, I mean part of it is the A24 bullshit where there's like they're not really horror movies in my opinion, but like they they they kind of ride around with horror movies and like maintain sort of an artistic credibility around them that allows them people to do things like insist on real effects because film hasn't been totally like uh uh has has totally lost any kind of artistic credibility as a genre the way action has so that means there are still a few good horror movies and they'll still like you know invest the extra for for real effects but now that's going to be gone to and the only thing the only good horror movies will be the A24 things where it's like you watch it you go was that really a horror movie or was it just sort of a just sort of a very uh like a a uh a dark drama or a thriller, it seems almost like a thriller would be more accurate a term than a horror movie. Blummouse is totally like first of all they make that purge movies and they use ZGI bullets in them so they already are on my shit list because the purge in my opinion is a great idea for especially a a exploitation style series of films and uh they really they really undercut the enjoyability of the of of the trashinesss of everything when some guy goes down in a fucking bunch of pixels. Yeah, I know hereditary for example, that's a horror movie, but midsummer I don't really think is a horror movie. Light, see the lighthouse is another one, I don't even know if that's a horror movie. I don't really think the lighthouse is a horror movie either. Yeah, the the the lighthouse is is a dude's rock, the the lighthouse is guys being dudes. Yeah, there's a real horror movie, it's called the fucking news. Uh, speaking of horror movies, we're going to be streaming the uh, the DNC second night tonight at 9 or 8:30 I think we're going on, but we're. going to be there for the opening gavel, the opening zoom gavel for the opening monster uh shit hole garbage fuck that we're going to get to see, does Clinton go tonight? I hope Clinton gets tonight at the day after the picture of or the day, yes the day the picture of him getting massaged by aneen victim on the flight to Africa gets revealed. Good, that'll be fun. Oh, we're going to have some riffing to do on that one. Oh boy, god damn, we might have to empty the notebooks for that one. They're putting him on stage, kit just. just the insanity of this, a guy who is a close personal fucking friend to a serial pedophile, a world, a world-spanning human trafficker with connections to the highest levels of power, including by the way, the evil president that we all hate, Donald Trump, and this asshole hangs around with him, there's pictures of them yucking it up on the private planes, bend to the the island, and Zoro, by the way, let's not forget. Zoro ranch where apparently they went for Christmas or something every fucking year and brought Chelsea one time. Sicos and this guy still the big dog that these guys pantter over and are just in rapture to buse he happened he managed to win two elections. Wow, amazing. He was able to basically show up at the right moment to ride the credit, the fucking uh nason tech bubble. of the 90s to two terms uh, just watch, watch the tide of history turn towards reaction and just go, hey, what if we did that too? that's his brilliant innovation to politics that means we have to worship from for the rest of our lives. hey, what if we just did what the republicans do, because that's what people seem to like, that's the easiest solution you could possibly give to an answer in any kind of uh uh, like brainstorming session. It's like these guys are kicking our ass, what to do? Well, why don't we just do what they do, and usually that's the wrong answer, because doing that kind of undermines everything else, but he didn't give a shit about that, he wanted to be in fucking power, and he did it, and I think that's something that gets underlook when we talk about the way these guys like reckon politics, when they're talking about what's pragmatic to get things done, what they what the the unstated assumption is not uh is that they are the ones getting the things done, the the the assumption is that the no matter what they'... will be in power, they assume the position of centrality to the process, because for them politics is an expression of their their ego, that's why they're in that position, that's what motivated them to get into politics, someone has to take that job, it gets taken by people who self-select towards that uh that psychological structure, that need, and what that means is that if they get into a situation where oh the the the you know the democrats before me made this pact with the devil to uh balance or to end in on the backs of the American working class and no longer be able to offer them any kind of meaningful economic uh intervention. we've essentially seeed the economic ground of politics completely, and we're going to have to completely depend on culture war. uh and like identity-based uh influences and and corporate money uh to maintain relevance. Oh boy, uh, that's shitty. What do I do? Well, most people, when they're answering that question are trying to do it from the perspective of a country, like what could we do together to like move the ship away from the Iceberg? uh, and a person who is psychologically fixated on a seaming power does not think that. They think, what do I have to do to use. the level of power in front of me, the democratic party in this case, in order to gain power in this situation, and so for the people who were in charge of the democratic party in the early 90s, they when they tell you this is what we had to do, they're not lying, this is what they had to do, if they were going to wield power, it was going to be under those conditions, but the thing is that's not there, there's a greater interest that they're not considering, which is what most people who don't imagine themselves in those positions are imagining when they imagine. the we or like making decisions, that's the problem with the representative structure is that is that you're concentrating the the will of whatever organized political coalition that can exert power in the ballot on one individual or or a bunch of individuals, but concentrated into individuals like the president specifically, and you members of specifically the federal government. and those people are going to be uh motivated by an underlying assumption that they have to be in the room, and that means compromise is always going to be what they say, uh, because anything else might involve them losing, and that certainly can't happen. King Hobo DNC, what's that? Who's king hobo? I didn't see that. I saw, I saw the fucking uh, the Stephen Still's Billy Porter thing about where they did some weird like rem funk remix of for what it's worth with him voging, wearing a some sort of dracula cape. Oh. king hobo is casic, okay, i didn't watch it, i just saw he looked like he was at a baseball field, uh, oh my god, that was amazing, because it really reminds you is that politics now, it's just like the level at the level of the spectacle of our little rock and sock and robot puppet show that we love so much, the people actually in charge of the controls, the literal channel changers for what we get to fight over, are just a bunch of old people, bunch of senior citizens uh who lived through the 60s litigating whether or not they were. That's it, it's all just rearguing the 60s cultural split because they they because all else has been foreclosed, first by you know the the the changing of the the party structures relationship to the market in the 70s, the introduction of what they call neoliberalism, and then of course they're just aging and reactive brains like no longer being able to to to... process reality as it happens, being much happier to live in their past, like Joe Biden, all of these people, they're thinking back, Joe Biden's, that's how you know Joe Biden's brain is really gone because he's in the 50s, these people are in the 60s because you know uh, that's how progressed the the the collective senility is, but Biden is of course because he is their tribute and he is their concentrated will, he is the most senile and so he's already back in the 50s, he's already back banging the the... razers to get him rusty in the in the rainbars, so once again we get Steven Stills 900 year ass fucking noodling on a guitar and this guy singing the song that's just from fucking Vietnam War movies, just get the get the blood stirring in these people who just want to have one more chance to go to the polls and say in the in the face of a fucking society falling apart around them through through through their direct connivance and and absolute uh blithe and difference for the most part uh that actually no man uh the 60s it was about peace dude it was about peace and love I'm going to go out there and vote for Joe Biden who thinks that it's actually about hepcats being able to take their main squeeze to the soda shop no neoliberalism is is is tinai in my opinion. Neoliberalism is the full is the full logic of the market and least on all society, which is only possible in a context where there is no alternative to it, where its energies can are no longer constrained by having to... battle like an a a different system to compete, it no longer has to compete and so like in the in the in in the economy that leads to monopoly, and they're they're in the monopoly stage now, it's it's and they're uh, and as such the they can move inward and and take that like market logic and apply it to everything. and that's and and carter carter. Carter was the guy who in terms of if you want to talk about like one figure who embodies the whole process, he was the guy, on behalf of a democratic party that had lost its connection to the working class in any meaningful way, and the working class had lost their ability to influence and direct uh the the first the democratic party and then a large enough section of the American people willing to vote for that party uh, we're no longer able to exercise enough power, and the... big economic questions that used to dominate politics, universal health, like direct government provision of of resources, the extension of government provision of resources to other areas of life, nationalization is a real priority of the state, the creeping, the creeping uh socialism that really does happen or or can happen anyway, in or is is theorized to happen uh in social democracies that keep making these you know non-reformist reforms to keep pressing things until the point of crisis. at which point if you've assembled sufficient uh state capacity uh express through sufficient organizational capacity as the class project you can then push it over the coke machine uh like Sweden looked like they were getting to that point when the meidner plan was introduced as a possible uh road map towards the state consolidation of of the economy in Sweden uh through the the the... what the minor plan basically said is that uh instead of paying cash taxes corporations are going to have to have give a percentage of their stock to the state every year and it's and that's not going to be like you give it once and it's ever every year so that means the state gains stock over time and eventually contrains has complete control that's the kind of thing that was potential and the US of course was not in any position to uh to do anything that dramatic because of how uh relatively retarded our social democratic path was relative to Europe, but especially relative to the scandinavians, but there was still stuff like like Nixon was talking, Nixon proposed a universal healthcare plan that is to the left of anything we have now or proposed by democrats she of Bernie, uh, and and Teddy Kennedy rejected it because they thought they could get the real thing, that's how close they felt they were, universal free college was a real thing on the possibility. and possibilities um and in every country the crisis moment came and because the because of the arrangement of forces, because the insufficientness of the working class to exercise political authority through the closest instrument it had, whatever that might be, led to capital taking over. now you could argue that that was inevitable, that you can never get. uh get there through the electoral process and that's proof of it. uh, I'm not, I don't know, I'm I'm kind of agnostic on that point uh, but I do know that the crisis moment had the crisis point came emerged, which was theorized, the the the victory of capital uh, being inevitable, the victory of capital being inevitable, that is what I'm not sure, I don't know if it necessarily had to go that way, uh, but of course then you get into counterfactuals, I do. i would say plainly that obviously given the conditions we had it couldn't go any other way, but the question is to what degree were there people and forces that could have changed the direction, at what point could the river have been flow like changed its course uh and i'm not sure i that's why i feel uh uh i do enjoy i that's why i feel basically and agnostic and i feel like that's kind of like that's where like history even if you have a dialectical understanding of the... so materialism, none of it is is uh, that doesn't make everything self-evident, it still has to be investigated. i would say like whether anybody could have punched through that, that log jam in the west, anyway through the electoral process, i don't know, but i would say that the 70s were the moment when the contest was definitively won by capital, which is means that the neoliberal area is the era of hegemonic. the libertarian conception of the state, the the the uh, yeah, becomes the underggurding political principle, the governing ideology, as it were of both parties, meaning that there is no longer a meaningful political vector for alternatives to libertarian state notion, emerging, so that's what I would say. It's getting sunny on me here, uh, this brings me to something that I've wanted to talk about, I hope it doesn't get too goopy and abstract, so bear with me and tell me if I'm sounding a little uh too out to lunch, but I wanted to talk there more about the concept that we now and love and know called ideology, yes, of course, what do we speak of when we speak of ideology, and there's a bunch of different definitions because ideology. in different contexts and there's ideology as like the undergrding uh system that generates that's generated by a material relationship and that structures the politics and the culture uh then there's self-conscious ideology is in what we think of as our politics that's different too uh but i would want to start at the basic level with what what ideology uh what purpose ideology ideology serves in this in the mind, what, what, what bridge does it, what uh, what function does it carry out in the establishment of the self out of just the the the data that our bodies perceive, because that's all we are, we're just a big thing absorbing, at least as far as we know, our brains are just the thing that absorbs what is given what what's what is what its sensor organs pick up in the thing around it, and then that is then turned into... an understanding of the world that includes an understanding of theself and relationship to the world, and ideology is, I would say the way that we bridge the gap between two different, but but but distinct, but linked and and and completely codependent concepts of self-interest. So there's two types of self-interest in in in social species. uh like humans, specific, more humans more than anyone, and that is one, you have the perceived interest, the narrow interests, physical and then you know like basal id related interests of the self, like first there's you know pure self-preservation in terms of preventing death and injury, and then the satisfaction of urges that arise from uh the task of. but even though our understanding of humans is that is the sum total of human of the human self is that id and then the stuff that we wrap around it and that's us and it's independent and we're all independent uh that's not true uh you can talk how you want about survival of the fittest but once once an animal in a species gains a certain of complexity of its social arrangement and its ability to communicate, communicate to itself, and then communicate outward to other members of the species, the more it creates a new vec, a complementary vector of evolution, which is social evolution, and it it there's an equilibrium point at which even though everyone has an individual id with an individual self-interest, that all interests are mutually advanced by cooperation, and ideology is negotiating the gap, how do we square having an individualized desire, which could be, you know, that guy's got a chicken, i want that chicken, you know, that guy's got a wife, i want that wife, the hobsian state of nature, how do we how do we uh assimilate this abstract notion of self-interest which we can recognize through trial and error we will recognize that it there is a necessary social component to life uh and then we have to pursue it, but how do we convince ourselves? how do we put the i into the we in such a way that we can subordinate to it? and ideology is: is the is the structure of that relationship, and I would say that the dominant western ideology, the the ideology, undergirding of capitalism, or our response to living in capitalism rather. uh and steadily taking over the world is one where the relationship is that there is only the the i, there's only the id, and then there is this social stream of otherness which we contract to engage with strictly to our advancement, and then any kind of social question, like how does that, how does that allow everyone else to advance? because remember there has to be a social component to to existence, they would say no, if everybody is self-interested, "the collection of that self-interest by negotiating it through a frictionless market without with no latency of transmission of information will rise all boats of once, of course that's absurd, because we are not one uh, even though we perceive the social dimension of our persistence more abstractly than our id, it is in reality as important, it's it's co-equal, and it and what that means is that society is co-constitutive of. what we think of as ourselves, like think about language, think about how much our thoughts and our minds and our conceptions, are our deep deep dreams are structured by the language we we are born with, we don't have any choice in that, that literally structures our entire mind, and it is comes from outside and it comes from the collective decisions of people we've never met before, and it is co-constitutive of our perceptions, our individualized perceptions which are filtered through these structures that. are socially fucking formed, it's co-equal, and ide, and and uh, that is why I think like socialism properly understood, the ideology of socialism, you know, I'm saying as an abstract concept, not as as something that is generated, something you act to create with the create in the world, but whatever you create is not going to be quite what you wanted, but it might move you in that direction and it will create a new ideology, I'm saying the abstract ideology that you operate from, of should. in my opinion be one that acknowledges the self as socially constructed, like and not just constructed, constitutive, like society is me, at a fundamental level, and i think if you actually absorb that reality as opposed to just as something you mouth, it it reduces a lot of the inherent conflict in in our notions of what socialism could be, the things that say like, well, people are always going to want to get ahead, people are always going to want more money than their... and stuff, it's like, yeah, but that is because we operate from an ideology that assumes we are individuated, that that is the fundamental capitalist ideology, and it is, it is essentially psychosis, if you want to get like if you want to get dramatic again, i don't know, i mean i don't, i think you could argue that in in the sense that it is radically fractured away from the reality that they're living in, like and and a reality, a fundamental reality that under like, that's why we're here, obvious, the only reason human existence exists is because of that. and capitalism is us trying to chop our arms off, that's what we're doing, it's in insane uh social suicide caused by a deluted psychotic sense of self, that's the ideology of capitalism, that's the ideology that is generated by turning every relationship into a transaction between strangers, eventually you lose all social forms, as you lose uh investment in social forms as having meaning and pile all meaning into personal indulgence, it turns you into a little psychopath, it turns you into an instrument of pure desire, which means pure competition with those around you, which means eventually destruction of all, common ruin of the contending classes, that's and that is the social animal that is man knowing at itself, because it's basically got a fucking uh, it's got a it's got a a rabies, it's got a fucking infection. That's overheating its brain, and the thing is the capitalism served the role, capitalism is a healthy bacteria at one point in that it facilitated the the uh the concentration of capitalism that was necessary to allow humankind to come into awareness of itself. The problem with humankind is that over time it spreches and spretches and the possibility of of transcending the... extraction of space and time to imagine that we are all part of one species, a true species with a species being and a spirit, a collective spirit that necessitates a degree of of technological transmission and ease of life most of all, a ease of um of social exchange where labor uh and labor and uh subsistence uh the the... linkage has been severed allowing for like the full flowering and development of human consciousness, and that's only that's only possible under a socialist conception of society, because over time the need for those distinguishing indulgences goes away because you can there's there's actual worth, there's value that is not to be found literally, there's not there's there's non-market value which we don't have right now, without if there's if if the only values to be found on the market, but the only the only worth of self, the only the only pleasures of the life, the only pleasures of of a spiritless world life in a world where God is dead and we replaced him with nothing except fear of the devil, like nobody believes in God, but we're all afraid of dying, which means we're afraid of hell, essentially, so we killed God and left the devil, and so in that world, what is to be done, but piling up lucer for yourself, distracting pleasures of self, and then see everyone else is competing for those in a world of drindling resources, if you believe that there's a value to social to social life, you create structures that in allow social life to thrive that get that don't require people to uh to flee to self-indulgence as a sucker because there's no lack, there's no hole to be filled, the way that we have created a whole, and i think there has to be some place for religion to help, in the in terms of if you're going to create like an ideological. bridge, like a self-conscious ideology that could that could break this this suicidal log jam, it's going to have to involves the language of religion and spirituality, because that's what people organize their minds and and and identities around, and you can define, it depends on how you define ideology, there's one way you can divide ideology where yeah like what i'm describing that's not ideology because that's just that's social life as it should exist you know it's it's the actual harmonious existence of humans the problem is you have to burrow through you know the the the millennium of human development to get there and maybe you won't uh because of the intervening reality of ideology emerging and reifying pathological expanding world of, just a desacralization of of of life, i guess i would so say, because the things, the processes are contained. I mean in the sense that they don't kill everybody, but they're clearly unstable, the process has to be regulated, and that's why as much as like the trad nazi types think, oh no, I've solved it, I've solved this, I've recognized the problems of capitalism, but I've just replaced - the self with uh the people, the vulk i've replaced the self as the locus of all you know meaning with uh my fantasy idea of a people, but what a coincidence, i'm picking the people who are most like me, because i am using the concept of a social life to just recreate the individual self on a larger scale, like Hitler was not trying to subsume himself into the social reality of of german existence, he was trying to to subborn german existence to him, to become an expression of him, and that's that's the that's that's what fascism angles towards, because even if you create your your beautiful corporate, corporate state, it's going to have to define itself against others, internal and external who have to be destroyed, and that process continues over time regardless of whatever happens, you win the war, you have to start another one, you will destroy yourself. because you are at the end of the day not engaging in a in a move towards the sort of degradation of ego away from individual market expression of self towards a social uh relationship with others, a contextualized self, uh, if you're not doing that, you are steering it towards eventual mutual annihilation, leaving none. can you day you're somewhat doing the same thing? say same thing as what same thing as who? i would like to know cuz i'm trying to figure out what you mean. like the way, the thing that really made me reminded me about the reality of that, like how etno nationalism can never stabilize and always destroy itself, and it's not becuse you could argue, because like the libertarian, the fantasy, the the fantasy, the ideological fantasy that undergirds the libertarian sense of self, is if everybody works towards their own advantage over time, and you remove uh, you remove barriers to to to exchange. everyone will advance, now that's not true, but that's what they think, it's ideological, it's deaper than thought, you know, it's just it's it's a it's a motivator that they don't even know is there, um, but we know that that's destructive, and like the fascist notion is that you recognize that, but then you say, oh no, we can all get together if we are operating out of uh, you know, the self-interest as ourselves conceived as part of some volk, well, in that case the only competition at that level has to be war, which is what they sought, uh, and even if you win all the wars, you have to define yourself against another, so an other emerges from within, depending on whatever crisis are being created by your uh, unstable economic model, which is capitalism, which is going to drill through the world's resources eventually and uh leave you in a position of unsustainable crisis of distribution uh, and the one thing that made me think of that most recently is John Cornen, the senator from Texas early on in in uh, the covid was asked about, hey, what about this covid thing, seems pretty serious cuz he was talking about, fuck it, open up, we got to save the economy, and he was saying, well, you know, the people are dying are people who are older, people with heart disease and stuff, and he's not necessarily talking at that point about, oh, they're poor black people or they're poor mexicans, he's just talking about like his constituents, and in a state like Texas where everybody has heart disease. "I think it's like the state flower is arterial sclerosis, and he's talking about people who are unlucky enough to get the thing, because at a certain level you have to like break off from a group and determinate other in order to redefine theself, it's the only, it's the only way thing that keeps you in a vacuum conscious of yourself is by recognizing distinction, that's why the idea of like a century deprivation is so terrifying to people because it's you." alone, but eventually you lose the sense of self, because you're not comparing it to anything, and that means that the the that the ethno state will eventually destroy itself either by over exertion or by turning inward, that's the death drive that undergs uh undergirds fascism, and because they both, and there's a death drive that undergs capitalism more broadly, and both of them are embedded in this notion that you can be an individual person on this planet. that you that there's something called an individual human being, that there is a meaningful, that's a meaningful category, like to to distinguish a person at a level beyond just to note that this is a distinguishing feature of a greater you know social organ, that's why i thought was uh good about the book, man and the... castle which it has the nazis and the Japanese as as world spanning empires with no enemies to see uh in the 60s and they're still going to have a nuclear war, it's inevitable, they will destroy each other, they have to. I uh on the on the fashist thing I remember I saw a map some nazi had made of Europe and it showed it where all the countries were under the rule of whatever like weird you know uh crypto nazi party. is in that country you know like the true Finns or whatever what if they ran every country and it was supposed to be like oh this is a dream oh if that happened every one of those countries will go to war with every other one over like iradentist territorial claims sure yes of course they would cleanse all the muslims but what do you think they would do after they did that or as they did that? You don't think that Alsas Loraine comes back into play if like the fucking uh national front and the it wouldn't even be the uh AFD probably be farther left right than that and Germany takeover fow out of here. Uh, someone wants to know about the death drive, I would say that the death drive is the brain's way of uh, just coping with the irreconcilable phenomena of being an individual consciousness that is both the sum total of existence and also aware of its own finitude, mortal, self-consciously mortal, that. that is that the closer you clean to your individuated being, the more uh, the more fratten, horrific life becomes, the more the more, the more the the experience of life is undermined, pleasure is is is is literally sapped out of the world by due to the overweening anxiety of the consciousness of of of time progressing and your awareness coming toward an end, a thing that a mind cannot conceive of because cannot conceive of anything that it it's it's the opposite of everything it's ever experienced, you can't handle that, and so life becomes misery, and so but because what makes us miserable is that we can't hold on to life, we don't want to kill ourselves, but deeper where we can't even get at, we want to die, we want to end this, but we don't want to know it's coming, we want it, we want to end it, and so we act in ways. that will bring about the amp, reasonable inter, oh it's not some else. man, somebody's really mad at gnosticism. are there any gnostics around? in terms of people who are doing the practice of it, weird people to get mad at, oh somebody asked me this on twitter, and now they reply repeating it, the most cringe vp vice president. That's an interesting question because all vice presidents, the ones wh didn't become president anyway are inherently cringe because what look at you, look how close you came, you shmuck, you freaking zadrule uh, losers, you got so close, couldn't get it, so they're all cringe, like oh, and then especially the ones who ran and lost, so guys like goer, mega cringe, mega cringe, el Gore is highly cringe uh, so i'd say anybody who ran and lost, any vp ran and lost is cringe, which is why one of the things that makes Nixon cringe, even though he was president is that he was also somehow one of those losers, even though he eventually won. uh John Nance Garner is pretty cringe, the guy was two terms under uh VP under FDR hated it every minute, he's the guy famously said the president, the vice president ain't worth a bucket of warm piss and worst of all it was because he represented the southern Reactionary segment of the Democratic party and he just watched in horror as those uh east coast fancy lad new dealers ran rough shot over the place and he was going to go in there and clean house buse he was assuming like everybody that you only do two terms uh but Franklin uh good old FDR got in that the end of that convention and he didn't trust any of those other horses to carry carry you know the the ferry across the river so he's he he did it and uh after telling garner he wouldn't and he was pretty pissed so he got owned there is a guy named Richard Mentor Johnson who was Van Buren's VP who was wildly scandalous uh mainly because he uh, I mean this isn't cringe in the present moment of course, but it certainly would have been cringe at the time, uh, he, like many slave owners of the day, uh, he uh, had a relationship of one kind or another, uh, with a slave uh, and children by her, but unlike those guys who kept it on the down low, you know, taking the candle to the backroom or whatever, he uh, had, he i don't think he married her, but he had her like as a public consort, and it was scandalous. i would say that Henry Wallis is pretty cringe, definitely uh, one cuuse god, he got so close, if the if if if FDR died a little earlier or the right wingers hadn't uh foisted truman onto FDR at the convention, he could have been president, but the thing is he was kind of a goofuus, i mean it's known now that the... progressive party that he ran on, that they kind of like spun up out of nowhere for him to run on, the the platform of was just entirely shot through with communists uh and you know a lot of of course you go, that's epic, that's cool, that's epically cool, uh, but the thing is the one guy on earth who didn't know that was Henry Wallis, he was he was a genuine like good government progressive type from the mid-west, like he was a farm expert, just the fucking he was a... he was a nerd, he didn't even know that he was sort of being moved around uh by by moscow, which again hey, if he gotten into the be the presidency, he got into the presidency uh and like set the course of the cold war differently, you now that's a real counterfactual that might have genuine violence in terms of changing the larger uh direction of of history, chanie is based as hell, chanie's not cringe, come on the guy ran the entire show by himself, he fucking took his house off of google satellite views, he had a man size safe at his office, he could suggested himself for his job and then took over the other guy's job, nothing cringe about shany, evil yes, but but not cringe. William Ruphas de Vene King died two month, he never even got sworn in, he died in Cuba of yellow fever, malaria or something. Uh, the other thing about William Ruphas de Vene King is that he was noted in Washington for his flambollant appearance, and afect uh and when you read the way people talk about him uh it's pretty clear if you read between the lines that he was a uh he was kind of he was a fancy man i guess you'd say it he was he was fabulous i guess you you'd his his nick his uh his nickname in was miss Nancy, i'll give you an idea, uh, Andrew Jackson called him miss Nancy, and James Macannon who was a good friend of his, uh, aunt fancy, so they were uh, they were boy, they were boyfriends, William Rune King and and James Ecannon were probably boyfriend and girlfriend, boyfriend and boyfriend, so that's not cringe in 20th century standards, by by night 21st century standards, but it was probably pretty cringe at the time uh and then he died before even really taking office also cringe. Huber Humpfrey is. pretty crinch oh yeah yeah oh that's got to be high in the list so Hubert Humpfrey was a guy who super ambitious sort of a northern northern uh LBJ at least in like his his his clear craving for high office he was the boy mayor of Minneapolis, he famously got the uh dixicrats to walk out of the DNC in 1948 uh for giving a speech about putting a civil rights plank into the into the party platform uh then he became a senator from Minnesota was a favorite of the AFL CIO uh and he ran for president in 60 against uh Kennedy and he just got blown off the stage by the glamor. There's a great uh documentary called Primary. about the Wisconsin primary 1960, which a lot of people thought was gonna definitely be Humpfrees because he was considered like the third senator from Wisconsin because he was always uh a guaranteed vote on all of the dairy price support legislation that Wisconsinites cared about very very much back then they still do but not as much as they used to. We had a guy herb Cole who was fucking senator for life basically because he was the guy in Washington who made sure that the fucking uh that the milk stayed above a certain price. so uh and then and then Kennedy is this you know jet setting uh east coast catholic guy in a state that even though you've got catholics obviously in Milwakee uh has a large you know rural protestant population uh and there's this footage of poor Hubert Humpfrey and like a VFW hall and rural Wisconsin going I'll tell you about this Kennedy he doesn't know an Ericorn from AUkali but then you see Kennedy in with in Milwakee you know surrounded by a bunch of uh bavarians and and uh and polaks just like losing their shit uh and and he won, he won, and then he won in west Virginia, which was huge, of course, the teamsters helped him out there, but so he was an ambitious guy, got to be LBJ's VP, got bullied by LBJ the whole four years, basically forced by LBJ to take his and run for president with his Vietnam policy, like that was the condition of John. and support to Humpfrey for the nomination, which of course he had to rest from the dead grip of of RFK at the fucking convention in the face of a giant police riot uh and screaming and and and a tumult within um the condition for LBJ supporting him was you better fucking take my my position even though he didn't really believe in it and so he had to fucking flog uh he had to flog that dead dog of LBJ's Vietnam policy until the fall. when he finally last month to go he stopped supporting it and called for moratorium on bombing and like you know peace pursuit like being being prioritized and he's he actually had been way in the in the back in the polls and he kind of climbed he and then the the election itself was very very close uh if you look at it Nixon won the the electoral college pretty convincingly but the actual vote total was was it was almost a tie I mean it was not it was 1960 but it was very very close uh and it could have gone the other way very easily, especially if Humpfrey had gotten out of out of LBJ's pocket a little earlier, so by virtue of just being a cringing Tody who ended up going down a guy who really was a very principle dude his his early career was like a civil rights stalwart and also a labor uh like a labor first guy who's who's like providing his presiding um political obsession was create full employment in America through like a guaranteed federal jobs program, which was something that uh the right fought tooth and nail uh until it was finally passed uh in during the Carter administration, but by that point had its entire uh actual enforceability and meaning drained from it, so loser, big old loser uh, and Nixon, it's funny, Nixon actually, uh, LBJ actually played futsy with Nixon during the campaign because he worried about Humpfrey. uh stabbing in the back on Vietnam because at that point he was like psychopathically obsessed with protecting his legacy on Vietnam and his position so he was willing to fucking that's how far he'd go he went to make sure that Humpfrey stayed on team so he just he whipped his ass down the fucking campaign trail until he finally was able to get out from under it but it was too late absolute uh cringe Pennce is incredibly cringe I mean come on to just be such a colorless cipher known mostly for being an absolute suppress repressed christian freak uh, well this guy's president, come on, pathetic. Dan quail is very cringe, he ran for president too, just not after that, he ran in 2000 and got no votes, so Dan quail, he was an actual just punchline. he was only known nashley for being just a dumb goofus and for spelling potato wrong, so he's definitely very high on the list, the first guy i think of really is is quale, quail and pance both from indiana, man what a dire presidential state, so they've got two of the most cringe vice presidents ever, and their one president, william, william henry harrison. a wasn't from Indiana and b fucking died his ass buse he drank poo water a month after being uh fucking uh inaugurated he shitted out his dudo ass can you believe it there's only one answer to the question most cringe presidential candidate there are many contenders George Romney Mitz's dad very high on that list romny also high on that list uh adley Stevenson of... anybody who ran more than once they get the stink of loser on them like buffalo Bills or the or the Vikings so Adley Stevenson, Henry Clay, William Jennings, Brian, losers, Bob Dowl, guy ran his whole life uh, but I don't think any of them compared to number one on with a bullet, oh Hillary's on the list, of course, Hillary's highly cringe, Hillary may be number two, number one with a bullet and an exclamation point, jeb, George, John Ellis. just please clap, you can't, can't beat it, can't beat it, and when you consider how much money he spent per delegate in that, which is i think by far the largest amount ever, he spent like he spent like he got like two delegates, i think and he spent over $100 million, i believe that's like the quick math there, so it's something like $50 millions a delegate, after coming from the poll position, after like not being like some crank millionaire spe being the inside track guy, and he was the young, he was the loved brother son, he was the good guy, he was the one followed the rules, while george was out gallivanting and snorting coke in the fucking cockpit of a fucking a10 wardog, this guy was studying the blade, he learned spanish, he went to campaign, he went to puerto rico with his with his with his uh mexican wife to like campaign for uh his dad when he was running against Reagan in 1980, well George did nothing. and who got to be president for fucking four eight years, who got to be president, goofis, not gallant, gallant gets to show up eight years later after his fucking family's name is shit because of how badly his dumb ass brother fucked everything up and all because he lost his first race, lautin childs is we have to thank for that, lotten childles beat him uh for governor in his first run. which threw off the time table and he was in his first term but uh in florida it took him that long to get back in which was not enough time whereas George had already had two terms in Texas cuz he he went like two years later if he'd gotten it then if he'd gotten the florida presidency then or the florida uh uh the florida governorship then he would have been the candidate in 2000 now maybe he doesn't win in 2000 there is an interesting counterfactual buse there is something to George Bush is just frat boy dip shit charisma like I always hated him and never thought he was charming because he is just like a bully, he's like a rich bully asshole, but that's an archetype that a lot of people like. Jeb is sort of absolutely without character, he's he's dring, he doesn't even have sort of the towering nobleble of his dad, like his dad is obviously was obviously a weenie, they called him a wimp and everything uh this this blue blood, but he also just had this imperious authority that meant that it didn't matter that you thought he was a nerd, still judging you and that made you kind of feel some sort of respect for him, jeb had nothing, jeb is just this cringiing and obsequious toad boy, yes the cringiest of the cringe, all right, see if you guys got one more question, oh all right i found it, most cringe civil war general, well obviously you got basically everybody in the army of the photomic before Grant, joe hooker cringe, uh, mclellan, huge cringe, might be number one right there, just this pompous little turd, scared, scared of his own shadow, burnside obviously hugely cringe uh, on the confederate side, braxton brag, wildly cringe, John Bell Hood amazingly. credge. I do think it's funny that everyone got mad that two of these huge military bases are named after confederates and it is kind of fucked up, but it almost feels like they were trolling when they did that because they're two of the biggest fuckups of the... federate army, bell hood i mean, hood himself personally destroyed his own army by just headlessly smashing it against uh against the army of the Cumberland, like at Franklin they just had to post up and just watch these dipshits march across the field without even doing an artillery cover the way lee did before pitch charge and just rinse their asses, oh jebs jeb Stewart was amazingly cringe, this this... ridiculous font laroyer thought he was think fight, he thought he was fighting in the English civil war, he thought he was prince Rupert of the Rine, goes on a gallavant around Gettiesberg while they're while they're fighting and has no idea, isn't able to provide any reconnaissance, and then gets uh, gets scattered when attempting to attack the rear by custer of all people, and then gets owned at yellow tavern, so jebs are uh crid, cringe generally, how would I win with the... war for the confederates, i wouldn't, why would i do that, that's absurd, you're crazy, no, the only way they had a chance of winning was with uh uh European recognition, that's that's the only way, so you start from that premise and then work outward, i don't really know, i'd have to think about it, all right, i'm going.
