 actually are we on, are we on, are we on? oh here we go, watch a weird ad about fucking oh yeah you should should you tweet about this i got to get my it's not on my phone anymore all right well we'll just hang out hello i'm here what up just holding the space i'm holding the space until um matt returns Okay, excellent. Oh, you can monitor uh chat on the thing. Are we online? I can't quite tell, you got to wait, yeah, you streaming just chatting. I didn't even like turn on a a stream caption for this. That's okay, yeah, whatever. Let's see okay guys, sorry that there we are, there we are, hey, hey, what up, what up, what up, what up, what up, what up, what up, what up players, what up? is we got a new setup here? yes, uh, Matt and i, i came over to talk some business with Matt and i figured that i would just bring some of my shit and do a little duos stream. we we are preparing, we are we're doing some some uh some testing out because as i said on the stream before i'm hoping to transition to sort of a multi-hour, you know, maybe three times a week stream at the office with me and Chris, yes where we can like trade things off and it's not me just staring at the at the chat and trying to like juggle everything and hopefully I will be the Raws to Mats Fraser exactly and gaming and gaming and gaming will be a big part of it that I'm very excited about because I do ever so much enjoy and I'm intrigued by all of the map based games that Chris and Virgil both love but I the thought of trying to play one and certainly trying to play one while talking to. to uh a stream gives me an actual headache, so uh the idea of being able to like watch somebody play and talk about it is very appealing to me and we're uh in the backyard here doing a little beta test, yes i'm um uh, i'm going to make matt watch me play civ 6 extremely badly, i've been playing civ for about uh two years now and i'd say i understand about uh 40% of the mechanics in that game so i generally just uh uh throw shit around and see what works but um, I don't know, well look forward to um to Matt yelling about the governing policies of elenor of Aquatane, I will be, I will be hooding and hollering about the Ottoman Empire, Ottoman's not a playable civ and can't even play the ottomans, if there's anybody in the chat who can make a Ottoman's mod for civ6 please let me all right because it's it's it's it's by country he can barely hear let's see if I can turn shit up it's by country right by uh it's by civilization but how all right is civilization so is there like an arab uh yes civilization is that it yes uh what do they what is that is that saladin yeah saladin okay yes wow that was piss off the turks that kurd it's like their guy cuz saladin was kurdish if anyone is uh not aware of that uh how's the uh how's the audio i just i have my mobile audio set up going so I'm not sure how it uh, how it goes, uh, yeah, see someone wants to play Europa Universales, which intrigues me because it seems incredibly complicated and is like like an early modern era thing and it's got all those those empires i love, you got your atomans, your safavid, i actually kind of want to just do a game where i try to see if the savavints could roll over the ottamans and take over all of Europe, because i kind of have a weird theory that they'... have done it because they were so damn uh they they like had a a fire in their belly by the time they started like rising and confronting the ottomans the ottomans just didn't have and uh you know if they could have rolled over Anatolia maybe they could have well that's pushed through the the bulkan cap uh islamic expansion into uh into Europe well that's the thing that I think will uh enrage you the most about these things is how the mechanics of it being an actual game uh make it difficult to emulate actual history ah damn it well that's fun I yes, you can do your own thing. um, but yeah, i i um, i personally ordered a gaming pc recently and i'm going to set it up at home and i think that's going to give me a better handle on uh streaming the mechanics of pc uh craft and being able to use the office one better cuuse felex just order all the parts for the office pc and then i tried to put together and had no idea what the fuck i was doing right uh i was i didn't even know how much i didn't know so i'm going to do it for myself no no and they fuck you the lakuna. we talked about this uh, i i do find it amusing, i don't a little bit about civ and that like canada is a siv, oh yes, canada is a sif, canada, let me get this straight, canada is a civilization, but the ottomans are not, Canada is not a civilization, Canada is an appendix of the of the English uh, the British Empire, wait, is Canada more an appendix of the British or the US at this point, well I mean we after world war I we took over, so they became our appendix, either way they are an extrusion, they are not in a civilization of their own right, all right, it's then let's do this cuz I was just asking you this: we were talking about the American presidenty as a general concept uh and how stupid it is and how funny it is that Joe Biden might probably be the next one or perhaps the last one. what point do you think the American president became as an institution the most powerful person in the world? uh, i think what you said uh, when we dropped the nuclear bomb, i think that's that's a very good adbc moment right there. because it gave us a a world destroying capability that no other country possessed at a very at the moment that we were in the process of taking over the supervision of the global uh empire that the that the battered European democracies motion uh were in the process of not being able to afford anymore. yes, okay, one second. i think the audio is accidentally the laptop. like this is not drawing power, hey better, is that better? oh, i figured it out. oh, we were doing it from the laptop, yeah, that was stupid. i have my, i have my little, bear with us, folks, my little audio boy here, brought this over in a backpack and we just threw it on there, this is not, there we go, okay, good, it just, it wasn't lighting up at all, i was fucking up, i was seeing green lights from the other thing, when you got when you got the red, you got the green light going, it's very hard to talk and figure out what's happening, which is why having someone here is very nice, there we go, much better. thank you for complaining in the chat uh cuz when they complained to me i just freaked out i remember one time i just quit a trap because the kept telling me i didn't sound good and i didn't what to do that was before i bought my mic i love i love doing ab yeah but now that i have my mic i'm i'm unstoppable if they say i can't hear you i'm like you're lying i know i know you can hear me because i bought a little lab so laptop um all right i'm i'm still going people said it was better now some people are saying it's gas lighting this happened me all the fucking time people yeah because they're gas lighting save let's see is that better am i doing this right is that better i should have these mics going there there yes yes now okay yes there we go okay great i just didn't have the driver turned on in the program okay they're all very excited okay there we go fine i was going to grab an old time megaphone and holler into the microphone again i threw all this shit my backpack and just walked over here so exactly yeah give us a break okay great uh this is incredible thank you okay cool fine uh so now the real stream begins after our first like 15 minutes of of jacking off oh god this is giving me flat as saying give me flashbacks to before i got my lab mic yeah um i'm glad that we were able to uh to get it rolling um so what were we talking about canada not we're talking about how Canada is not a civilization This is an absurd concept to say that Canada is a civilization. Give me a fucking break. I'm trying to think of like what would count as a civilization in the western hemisphere given the you know that it's like it's all settler colonialism. Sure, it's basic at this point it's basically all the same thing. It's all part of an American hegemanny. There's like three civilizations in the western world. Yes, and yeah, yeah, that's okay. Who's who are the civilizations in the western hemisphere? It's like anglo-america is like one. Yes, Canada, Canada and the US and like all the sy. Australia as well, the five eyes, yes, yeah, yes, US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the UK, that's one civilization, one big thing, uh, Ireland kind of, although you can't tell them that cuz look get pissed, because they don't want to think they're part of the anglosphere, I'm sorry, it worked, none of you speak Irish, I'm sorry, they teach, did you know that they teach it in school? good, keep going, none of them learn it, no one speaks it, uh, any Irish people can attest to this, none of them speak Irish, even though they learn it all the way through elementary school. and probably into into later school too, I wish I had taken Irish as a second language in a like college or something, that's an obnoxious pick, that's such an obnoxious pick, I took german in college just because I did too, I took like I took like six years of Spanish and middle to high school and then when I took the placement test in college I got Spanish one cuuse i sucked shit at it so I was like yeah fuck it I took German my entire high school career and college didn't learn any of it have no retention of it at all dust trogisks. tragus leaked projector, the overhead light projector, and I'm kind of glad because I i have a weird theory that people have told me is crazy, but I that doesn't stop me from believing it that like if I was a native German speaker or even a one I would be an insane person right now, because I really do think that that that there's a reason that like higel and marks and shit like all spoke German is because it lends itself to a certain insanity, well it's it's it it allows you to live in a symbolic realm, yeah, whereas English with the most words of any language, is inherently earthy and bound, because you're describing things you know in very discrete detail as opposed to... like seeing the world and then turning it into like six 12 uh syllable concepts, well that yeah, i like that description of english bause it's like all of english language is just like going to a place being like, what do they call that thing around here? okay, we call it that now, yeah, the best, the funniest example of that is kangaro, you know the story of kangaro, i don't know the story of Kangaru, uh uh, this might be a apocrip, i'm not a linguist, but the the the apocriple story about people can confirm this is a kangarou essentially in in a in one of the uh one of the aboriginal dialects uh means i don't know what you're saying because the story is it's some Brits asked some originals what are those things they say kangarou and they're like oh yeah okay that's what they're called but they were really just saying i don't yeah i don't what are you talking about dude yeah and yeah like i don't think it's a coincidence that Hitler was german you know what i mean i mean there there cuz like the daniel hold the daniel goldhagen thesis does not hold you know who the kings of of anti-semitism were in in modern Europe, it was not Germany, it was France, France invented modern anti-semitism, dryfas a fair, yes, but Germany is the one who ended up doing the holocaust, and part of it is because they lost World War II, and France quote unquote won it, that's a big part, but that language man, I don't know, scary. Uh, there we go, apparently it's not real, but hanger thing is real, i knew it wasn't real, it's too good, it's too good of a story, it's too good of a story, there are a few good stories that are actually true though, like this like the invention of the sandwich, the so that the earl sandwich could hold his meal while playing cards right, that's true, that is not made up, i just the only thing that makes no sense about that is that it would take until like we had recorded history to discover the sandwich, it seems so obvious, you would think, yeah, you would think, there's a lot of things though that are obvious that don't ever birth, like they never figured out the wheel in uh, like pre-Colombian America, you know, they didn't have the wheel, what i don't i just doesn't make exactly, because you look at the wheel, you're like, duh, but there are specific things that have to happen to get you to a wheel that they didn't have, the wheel one of the early technologies that you research uh in civilization, you have to research it, which I guess is fairly accurate, you have to think of sit, sit down and you got to think of the wheel, it doesn't just pop upside, cuz now we are all like, you need wheels, but if the... front wheels, you have to have someone be like, all right, I'm sitting down and figuring out this until I actually get it, and you know what helps with that is uh, is you know something like uh, having uh, I don't know, uh, horses, yes, that helps, which western civilization, westerns uh, the western hemisphere does not have, yes, no horses, no matter what the book of mormon might tell you, there are no horses in pre-Colombian America, which is very funny because like when the when when horses did show up the suo. use them to basically take over the entire like uh planes almost overnight, they like turned into the mongols, they're like, oh, this is great, and they just were, they took over everything, yeah, as soon as the horses showed up, but they didn't have any before that, so they couldn't do it, horses, great technology, top incredible, incredibly important technology for uh human civilization, so like you got no horses in west in the western hemisphere, and then in poor Africa they have zebras instead, which are untamable, which are untamable psychopaths, more zoo keepers die, yep. from zebra, any other animal. Zoo, zebras are the deadliest zoo animal. Uh, that's really funny. There's a thing in gun germs and seal. They look so they look so sweet. I want to go up and just feed one in a little apple. There's a little bit in guns germs and seal when Jared Diamond imagines like what if Africa had been able to turn the rinocerus into like a war animal like in black Panther. Yeah, like exactly, like in real life, they would have they would have wrecked everybody, but you can't do it. You you have. have to go to war, you have to go to civilization with the resign of rinoceruses and the and the water buffalo and the horses and the zebras that you have, uh, is guns germs and steel good, where are we on that guy? everyone hates it because like any of those histories, it's very facil and it skips a lot of things, but i think it's useful for people just to get an idea in their head that civilizations and shit happen not because of people's desires, you know, not because people had an idea and wanted to carry it out, but because they are dealing with a given physical reality, material conditions in terms of animals, floor and fauna that they have to confront, and that is what shapes things, the specifics of can be argued all day, but I think that approach is more useful than anything, because seeing shit like Ben Shapiro talking about the two cities, yeah, yes, makes me just want to blow my goddamn brains out, because it's like the idea that it's just, ah, forget, forget, forget the conditions, you know, forget the constraints of the material world I live in, I've got an idea, where the fuck did the idea come from, and and his idea is God gave it to me, it's like, okay, this is just schizophrenia, you're just, you're just trying to turn schizophrenia into a description. for the historical processes, every uh, every uh historical figure in bench of hero's world is like Henry darger given like an idea in scribbling it's individual people just sitting there like looking at a fucking like a sunset until they have an idea ah democracy and then they go and carry it out they convince other people to do it yeah it's it's the liberal i was saying this yesterday it is the liberal conception of the self that we have some sort of inherent thing that is responding to the world and then that response creates a new idea that we then to like wrangle with the world, yeah, no, we're empty, we are empty, we are hollow, uh, speaking of that, I was reading about the voyages of Christopher Columbus the other day, uh, because I need something to put me to sleep while from wikipedia, uh, and that that is all those things, it's like, why did he do that, not because he was a genius, but because they needed the spices to sell them, we need a better out to the spices, because the ottoman shut it off, the ottoman shut off the land route to to the spices and the funny thing, the two funny things. that i i pulled out of reading the entire wikipedia page of the voyages of Christopher columbus were uh one that he did it wasn't that the people thought the world was flat that was obviously a myth but that he massively miscalculated the circumference of the earth and if America was not there he would have absolutely died he would have they would have just each other on the pot yeah like there'd be there would be some undiscovered island in the middle of the ocean where like a bunch of bleached bones and and shipwreck chunks of the nina or just like floating just sitting on the on on a beach somewhere. the other thing that i thought was very funny is that like first that first round of explorers who got to america columbus were like extremely disappointed cuuse they were like there are no spices here and then they like oh there's gold okay we'll get the gold but they wanted spices took it took a few years to figure out that there was gold a lot of and a lot of native torture was gold yeah yeah he literally like ran a uh ran like a protection racket on the local natives. to try to get squeeze gold out of them and they were like there's not gold here dude, i don't know what you're talking, that was one of the big like redpill like left-wing redpill moments for me as a kid is when i found out no, they didn't reject columbus because he thought the world was round, they thought it was flat, it's because they accurately thought how they had an accurate uh understanding of how big it was, and he had an insane crank idea that it was way smaller than everyone else thought it was, like it was the catholic church, they weren't saying it's flat, they were saying dude, it's way too big, but knew there was a continent in between us and the fucking India, yeah, so they they he was right, classic American, he kind of missed the first american actually, he like he is an idiot who officially was miscalculated, but huge riches, absolutely accidentally hit into something that he had no idea was there and then actually, I'm a genius, it's so funny that columbus has become like a a lightning rod for um for for like Italians claiming like you could not pick a worse Italian to claim as your dude as I've said, not Italian anyway, there is no, that's not italy, Italy does not exist, and somebody was trying to tell me, well it's an ethno-linguistic conduction, it's like uh, even to this day Italian is more like a a like regional and dial like dialect different than like most European countries, like there is an almost a mutual in comprehensibility between Italian dialects to this day, you want to talk about fucking as it was in like the early modern and medieval periods and like Genoa went to war with Venice for 100 fucking years like what is how are they supposed to imagine that they're part of the same polity yeah uh Italy is imaginary uh don't let anybody try to convince you that Italy Italy is not a real country yeah Germany isn't a real country either cuz the thing is like if you're not a country by like 1850 you're not a real country I only recognize the Holy Roman empire like anybody is try to make a country in Europe after that in Europe specifically I would say. because of how long there been polities in Europe, if you don't get like a a thing together by the industrial revolution, you're forcing it, and you're doing a trihard, you're doing, you're posting crinch, and as we've seen in literally every example of it, if you don't get your shit together by 1850 and then try to do it every anyway, it makes everybody in your country insane, yep, what a coincidence, the two places that founded fascism as a response to the crisis of world war 2 of the depression where Italy and Germany, the countries that just got under the scene, we're just discovered, or just became together. I mean in that way America just got it in under the wire, but honestly jury's still out on that, well we were a thing before the industrial revolution is the thing, it's but like 60 years, yes, but still under the wire she said under the wire, uh, no, garibali. the obvious choice for the for the day, garibaldi day, who wid say no to the garibaldi day? uh, i mean a lot of people, the pope maybe, pope wasn't a fan, and you know, i bet Francis would probably be okay with it honestly cuuse he seems kind of chill about it, but did gearbely ever come to america? he uh, no, but he was invited to uh be a general in the union army by some enthusiastic uh uh uh republicans in 1860s, that's cool, i think the thing about columbus is that you have to be an Italian guy who came to america. but he didn't come to america the way these people imagine America, like their idea of America is the continental United States, and he did never set foot on the continental United States, no, he made it to the mainland of central America, but not the continent United States, and if you were born there now, would most of these gumbas who talk about uh Columbus consider you an American? No, no, if you're from the Dominican Republic or Haiti, do they consider you an American? Absolutely not, no give me a break, f out of here, Garbaldy, come on, yeah, he not only, made italy, the march on robe, for god sakes, the red shirts, he made the country into a thing, like he's the first italian of any kind, he is the first Italian, god, garibaldi did up to the United States, somebody reminds me this, he did go to South America, he was actually a bank robber in Argentina, oh that's cool, yeah, no, he was like a brigand and like a like a like a girl guy, no, Garibally is one of those like world historial figures who are just you read about him and you're like how is this a real guy like John brown yeah yeah you read how is a real guy just in terms of not only having a preternaturally like modern moral sense that's transcensus moment but also the will and ability to use that moral sense and turn it into something meaningful kind of un unbelievable as opposed to columbus who is basically just a fucking dumb ass scam artist trying to like wheel some money out of uh out of bankers and the queen of Spain and shit yeah and he doing everything with his like six sons yeah his yeah his six large adult son six large adult sons rolling across the place uh Jose garabaldi folks people more and more they're recognizing that he's great he's wonderful cuz yeah like give the give the day goes a day give him a day everybody fine have a day uh we'll celebrate uh as i partially attail myself i would nominate celebrating the mutual day of uh gerobaldi and gaga yeah the two visions of italian excellence that's that's yeah that is it the masculine the in the historical in the present, two people, politics and and and art, yes, absolutely, all right, if if who would you want, you're also Irish, also Irish, well they have st patrick's day, Saint Patrick, by the way, not Irish, he was welsh, I am the synthesis of the the two most hated white ethnicities of, well because there the trihard white ethnicities, they were the ones that showed up late and tried to like assert it more, yeah, as opposed to the wasps and the crowds were a little bit more laid back about the whole thing about the whiteness. but if they were going to get rid of st patrick and they should buse as i've said he was welsh he's not irish who would you want as like the guy for the irish or the edge not bono not bono the edge i like the way he plays guitar i like his little like uh trinkly effects it's good uh yeah uh or what's his name phil phil linnet from uh uh from uh from thin lizy yeah from thin lizy yeah uh Timnet and uh, I don't know, one of the guys from the uh Irish uh revolution just uh doing a bro grabs as a statue, yeah, uh, you can't really do, there's this guy, John, this guy uh, not John Mitchell, David Mitchell, I can't remember his name, he was a hero of 48, he was the hero the the young, young Ireland movement, and he came to America and like a big speaking tour and there were tons of guys who came from Europe after their revolutions in 48 failed. like uh koshuth from Hungary, there's a street in Brooklyn named after him uh, the names of the Brooklyn streets are so loud, everybody is either like a northern slave owner or a like uh yeah like a revolutionary from Hungary, yes so Koshuth guys like that uh but mitchell uh John Mitchell yeah uh I always wonder if it's John Mitchell because that was also the name of Nixon's attorney general but it's one el instead of two but he came to America after you know fleeing the Brits after the young Ireland rebellion and he was like a lot of these guys he had an a you now nationwide tour where he was fetted everywhere uh and they asked him about slavery and whereas a lot of guys like uh like uh o'connel Danielnel the the the the the sort of the godfather of the modern irish uh uh independence movement who was vielemently anti slavery met Frederick Douglas when he toured Ireland uh Mitchell came to America and asked slavery's like oh slavery's good you guys need to keep it it's great actually when we get enslaved by the Brits that's terrible but when you guys do slavery it's actually. cool, cool, yeah, and and that was like the tradition for so many Irish Americans, getting on the good side of our brutish uh, race-based social order, we did a bunch of riots about that. Yes, yes, that was like, what you're doing to us, garbage, awful, other people, we're the most oppressed people on earth, doing it to other people, that's actually cool, yes, yes, uh, if I was a 19th century guy, I would love to be on that speaking tour circuit, that seems like one of the best gigs you can get in the 19th century, oh god, it was so fun, especially because you could do it about anything, you just like, if you were charismatic enough, you could go around and be like, you know what, uh, snorting barley will cure uh your respiratory uh, there was a guy named colnel Robert Ingersall in the post war, post civil war America whose deal was he would go from town to town and he would give speeches about how God didn't exist and everyone get mad at him, but it would be all be a big deal, he was an early news, he was a like an early new atheist, yes, and he would do the thing, he would do the classic thing, he'd say god doesn't exist, and if he did, and if he did, he has, he has five minutes five minutes to kill me, exactly, he would do that, yes, I'm a he was the first professional atheist, yes, uh, I'm amazed that no um enterprising god lover didn't just bring a gun to one of those performances and shoot him and be like, I'm act, God made me do it, yeah, you asked for it, yeah, but the thing is, it's like it really goes to show you, even in in a much more godbothered era, he didn't get killed, because at the end of the day, it's a fun show, people like getting mad, people love getting mad, you kill them, you can't get mad in him anymore, I i'm so mad at this guy, I can't wait for him to come back in six months so I can get mad at him again, yeah it's the early version of like Andrew Dice Clay coming to your town and tell and telling you how uh how you guys are all pussies? yeah it's like oh you believe in god I fucked him oh yeah the rich history of Americans loving of stand up comedy of people uh loving guys random losers coming to their town and telling you how you suck yep but in a humorous way I mean those are the two strains of uh stand up comedy either saying how i the performer suck or how you the audience suck? yeah, yeah, they called him the great agnostic, that was nickname, he couldn't even go into atheist, well like i said 19th century, you don't want to get people to it, seduce and bone god, i like that phrase, wait, is it what is all this thing about uh, like how... Biden is going to kill God's going to he Trump was talking and and it's a very indication of his inability to like he knows what he knows vaguely what the people he's pandering to like but he has no personal understanding or like imaginative understanding of it because he doesn't share it yeah so he said this is a quote I believe he said he's going to hurt the bible he's going to hurt God's going to hurt the bible yeah he said he's going to hurt the bible and hurt God he said and he also said no with Trump. with with Biden, no religion, no anything, no religion, biden god, yeah, he goes, no religion, no anything, but yes, I mean, I would love for bidon to get in there and do a complete nialism, oh wait, I can't say nialism on the stream, no, oh god, oh god, no, no, you're going to hawkpill everyone, I can't end, you cannot, no, you can't be hawkpilled, but my favorite thing is would just be very funny for bidon to get up there or do his inauguration be like, um, uh, everything's meaningless, there are. look, look here, i was uh thinking about my good friend uh uh from back in the life guarding days and he was telling me a good story when we got in our big corvette and said, look, joe, nothing means anything. i would like him to give a speech that is an exact replica of his speech when he voted to invade Iraq replacing Saddam Hussain with God. we're gonna we're going to do targeted strikes to drive the tyrant god from his palace, running control in heaven. Yeah uh, no, but the like him saying hurt, he's going to hurt God, that really does tell you all you need to do about Trump's understanding of like the supernatural con like god is just like another real estate developer who might like have to deal with higher taxes or bad pr or something, god his underline it's very down right now, he's not making much money, yeah it's not very, it's like Biden's in there, and you know what, he's not talking about God, God, his q numbers are going down, he's very hurt. uh, this is the biggest, you get, you vote for Trump, you vote, you vote for me, we're going to have the biggest god we've ever seen, a huge god, folks, god's going to be gigantic, he's going to be huge, but now that's that's and that really does tell you all you need to know about everyone, although evangelical love him, it's they've they've lost any any the fig leaf that they really believe in anything, yeah, they only believe in owning the libs and in uh protecting what they'... to be their understanding of America, what is that Mr. Show phrase the name of the episode God and religion in the Bible, it's uh, life is precious, and God and the Bible, that's literally like Trump trying to... to to wing it for uh the evangelicals and the uh the talk show on the lifeboat sketch oh the talk life is precious and god and the bible yeah very good mr show really did have everything you need to know 20 years ago it's one of those things that that is like mustard iones by the way we now have mustard ayones yes we do they they actually invented that product uh now it exists the dueling political ads yes yes yes parison greely the third. um, yeah, there's a lot of stuff in there that feels very of a uh uh, a future moment, someone is reminding me that that line was a quote, a direct quote from a Jerry Springer episode that one of the writers had watched, where one of the audience members was like talking about something and said, but life is precious and god and the bible, and now you just do it in the trump voice in front of a bunch of evangelicas, folks, life is precious and god, and the bible, he's going to hurt the bible, he said he's gonna hurt the bible. how Joe Biden with a hammer going at it on the king James version? How, how you gonna hurt like, I mean it just shows like what, a a a total fixation on the material reality and and the self, especially as you get older and your ability to like racio sense today gets lower, it means that you lose object permanence, you lose object permanence, and so concepts like God in the Bible no longer transcend space and time, yeah, and they become totally fixed and mutable, like he's going to hurt the bible, like that's a thing you could do, hurt god, like that's a thing you could do, he's going to do like a heavy a a wrestler promo video where he rips the bible in half like it's a phone book, somebody uh chatted the phrase uh curbstomp the bible, which i think is a funny phrase, i like that, i got to tell you he gets up there on january 20th in front of Roberts right, and you know what you got to do, you got to put your hand of the bible, instead of putting his hand, he just slaps it to the ground, just slaps it, just slaps it, pulls out a chainsaw like it's a sam ramy movie, just chops it and just pulls a a a paperback copy of the the god delusion and gives it to fucking uh Roberts, I'll be sworn in, I'll be sworn in on this, jack, um, but uh, uh, it's been very funny that uh, I i saw that Trump was also on the um, the the water pressure tip today, again, yes, so he's he's there's a 60,000 dead people, five issues. going into this campaign, oh the water pressure, joe byden is an is an atheist anarchist, and he's out, he's out to lunch, water in two ways cuz he loves the boaters and he hates the bad water pressure, he loves, yeah, the water needs to be, you need water to float your boat and also, you need to just fucking slay your skin off you when it comes out of the you need to be a cramer in that episode of flush 15 time and the thing is he's kind of right about that in that with the flushing. like the low flow toilet go off go off king, this is a classic example of liberal good do gooderism, it's like yes, let's let's conserve water with our toilet flushes, you forget, this is the United States of America, every one of us eats three meals of like 90% protein a day, those dumps are like fucking photon torpedoes, they're not going to go down with one low flow flush, are you kidding me to uh actually see a a real analysis of the the volume of American shits versus? i don't know like a norwegian or a french yeah like we're eating we're eating beef for three meals a day it's just i know i've already had two servings of beef there you go it's like it's a supernova of dump this thing can't be handled by a little a light oh one and a half gallons that's not going to do it you need three to four gallons minimum in america for the dumps that we put out unless we stopped eating as much meat which we're not going to do the the water i crap twice a week and it's the size of the css hunley every time the and somebody pointed out in the the chat with imagining Trump's turds, that that seems among the things that is most maybe a u problem that he talks about, yeah yeah, yeah, but well the thing is is that yeah, he has no real relation to normal things, he's never driven a car, he's never shopped, i don't think he's ever exchanged money for services in person in his life, here's a real question, i know it's like you know he's the cheeto, he's the the orange man is bad, he's a goddamn cheeto, but i am fascinated with his makeup as just a physical. ritual because does he do it himself? go to the bathroom? no, the makeup. oh, the makeup. does he have a person? like, i'm thinking about cuz always trying to think about Trump's relationship to the physical, mundane world is always so mind boggling. real, yeah, does he have a person? is there a white house makeup artist who does it every day? because i've noticed that i think since the pandemic started it's gotten worse. it it really, he looks really bad right now, and yeah, the makeup is looking really. just a little orange circle around his face, it cuts off cleanly, you can see the lines in a way you didn't used to be able to see, there's that the the picture from him coming back from oklahoma, where he's got just... ring around the collar bright red on the collar of his shacket so my question is does he does he wake up every morning and spend an hour applying a like a full face of bronzer yeah and then go out and then at the end of each night does he like take cold cream and wipe all the shit off his face that's these are all very important questions and i don't know the answer and i would like to know because every since his be the beginning of his presidency one of the things that's always been most mind boggling to me has been imagining him in the... in bedroom out of vanity with like like the scene in Zoolander where he's taking off the coal and just wiping off everything yeah uh he's he's playing goodbye horses yes uh yeah because there's two conflicting instincts in me when i think about does he do it himself one is well he has to do it he can't do it himself he can't do anything himself no he's baby but at the same time every day for his entire adult life there's someone like there at what like he gets up he sleeps the hours at night or whatever he's up in the morning watching fox and friends, somebody's there at 6 am to fucking put the stuff on his face every day, yeah that also seems hard to believe, but i also have a hard and also seeing him doing it, and also if that person exists, why don't we know their name? that would be one of the the president's literally most intimate advisors, that's true, they'd be they'd be with him longer than most people in a day, in an an incredibly intimate way, yeah that's true, this is why this question really like gets to meever, i mean i like to i i really do enjoy imagining him doing actual like mondaine tasks, i love making a sandwich, i love imagining him trying to make food, shopping is very amusing to imagine, imagine him doing the what was driving a car? uh, i when you, so you guys were talking about trump driving a car on the um, on the episode and i tried to look up to see if i could find any evidence of him driving a car and i could not do it, i don't think he's ever done it, i don't think he's ever been behind the wheel of a vehicle under power in his life, like he got he got in the in a golf cart, he can get in, he can do a golf car of course it does, but the thing where he's driving the truck you know in the front which is beep beep beep but there was not underpower yeah and firing a gun to me is the most funny he his arm would rip off just him trying to manage if you just gave him not like a night not a 22 or something you give him like a 45 or or something like a cops gun yeah and you make him like just fire without a warning i'm just imagining the ripples that would happen through his body and then like the app absolute like shock and horror and how he would try to recover of it in in public? yeah, imagine him shooting a gun in public is very funny, yeah, like going to to like trying to bootch it up for a uh like a like a bunch of NRA guys and like going to a rifle range and shooting a rifle in public, yeah, and and i mean it's not like they would not abandon him obviously, they would still think he was alpha, but i would be very interested in the specific way that they processed his girlish failure to not look. like a a a a little girl just doing the cartoon thing where you like shoot the thing and immediately fall over in a 90 degree arc yeah yeah or like you you don't you get the recoil and you hit yourself in the face a shiner something like that yeah uh should we do like questions yeah let's do some questions if anybody has any we've just been riffing i'm sorry to maybe uh to to bomb to bomb these chats i mean i am the only person, maybe the only person, maybe some people uh listen to them all, but I listen to every single one of these since I put them on YouTube, so I figured uh, I'd come over or set one of these up if I was coming over here to talk future project, this is uh, this is like going to be hopefully what we do more of if we can set up the uh, yeah, now that I think we're a little more comfortable just like you know being the two two of us in an office setting, I think that is probably fine, yeah. is there any more of that tekila or is it all gone? i think i got rid of it. i brought over a little a little thing of um the rocks tekila, teramana tekila which i found a supplier of near here uh so in our own in our own small way Matt and i because we have been consuming teramonta are now both investors in the uh XFL. oh right he bought the XFL. what's he gonna do with it? i i have a rock the the rochology group chat and we've been very much speculating. first of all got it for $60 million dollars which i assume means he just bought the brand, it's not like the XFL has like offices or employees or i mean i think he did buy its assets but there are not that many of them yeah it's mostly the brand but then there are assets minimal assets so at that point you're not you're getting a brand and you're not getting much risk i doubt he's going to launch a full fucking league of games yeah but if you can like generate a few expo games in like the spring like networks are always going to want to run football, it might he might just do like a reality series, a reality series, he loves reality, he's he's hosted like five reality shows since he became famous, which honestly? I find that a little uh low rent, yeah, and I think that's cuuse he's from the carnival wrestling circuit, he doesn't understand the idea that there should be a brand that needs to be like protected, he kind of says yes to everything, yes, and you got you got to get it while it's hot, while you're hot, I get that, but like I, it's, I mean, maybe it's maybe that is more in turn with the moment and more understanding of the nature of like our you know terminal end state here where you can't be assuming that you're going to have any broad brand to build on in the... future so just strike while the iron's pot say yes to everything, but it it does rebell against my my sensibility of a guy who's that big of a fucking movie star yeah doing reality shows but all tom cruise doesn't do reality shows show it's true um but that's because he didn't come from fucking wrestling he doesn't have that the the grinding uh Tom Cruz doesn't own a takisila company either he does not he has no brands yeah he's never done a commercial has he probably has at least once folks is Tom C's ever done. cres ever done an ad in the United States or internationally? yes, I'm thinking about it, he might have done one internationally, but like maybe a Japanese ad, everybody does like a Japanese ad, yeah like schwarznager does a Japanese man, um, but the the yeah the XFL thing is a little baffling just because he the rock is such like success-win mindset and literally everyone who is ever tot like the XFL has just been like a boondoggle who has only caused humiliation for every everyone who has touched it. no, I mean it failed once already, it's failed twice already, they tried to bring it back like a year ago, yeah, well I mean it failed once and then they brought it back and they failed again, so I don't know, people don't get that like sports are huge in this country, but one of the things that makes them huge is that they are monopolies, yeah, and that they have that anti-trust exemption uh, that that the thing that makes them special, the thing that makes them things people care about is that they are prescribed, yes, like you only get them for x number of months a year. you only get them with x amount of talent, like a certain amount of talent that you attract with the amount of money from a single source from a single source and that a thing like that is not uh it's not there is no there's not a huge hunger for off-brand versions of it yes which is what the XFL is it's off-brand it's low rent and people don't want low rent versions of sports and the only thing it's literally if you really want versions of sports watch college sports, which is for and college sports to me is for siccos who get off on the idea of that they're not getting paid of punishment, yeah, they're like, ah, yes, yes, perform for free, yes, you're not getting paid at all for this, you're being ordered around by a little tinpot martinette psychopath coach who has the power of life and death, he can cut you at any moment, also the most well-paid, the most well-paid employee of the state, yes, yeah, oh yes, you could be cut with any moment and you'll be, you'll be cast into the poor house, i'm like, i'm like, the professional sports where they get the mouth off and where they get paid a lot of money and they can't be bossed around, it's for it's for the real siccos, it's for the real perverts, but like there's no third thing, hey they're still getting paid but less, but that's because they're less talented, but they can maybe hurt each other more, i mean you'd have to make that explicit, yeah like you would have to make the xfl genuinely dangerous, my idea for if if this if this could be done safely. just put like uh randomly like six concussion mines in the ground of the the football so just like once a or like six times a game somebody just uh not killed but just like you know blown into the air a few feet yeah well or killed oh hey a little a little uh squirrel buddy just ran across yeah we got squirls back here it's delightful little guys uh all right any uh any any any cues? any any questions in the chat so we can take a few before we do i grill no i do not grill because we live in New York and one of the biggest premiums here is outdoors outdoor space and i have longed for outdoor space but my last i've never been able to find one in an apartment i've literally considered renting an apartment that was about literally like 200 or 300 square feet of apartment space but with a like 600 square foot balcony attached to it and that was a pretty compelling offer to me buse i was like i don't know like six months out of the year i could just live outside but no i've never had outdoor space so i've never had a grill uh i'm not i'm okay grilling i would say i'm competent maning a grill but i'm not a master griller yeah i i have by far the smallest department of anyone on the show but that's because i get some bouncing your space and i have to say i mean i didn't know this was going to happen when we got the place but now with uh corona quarantine i'm incredibly happy that i had some Yeah, it's nice to just have a little uh, my next, my next grilling project is that after I smoked that pork, and you had some, it was good, right? It was good, it was good. I want to do an all- day brisquets with the... with the snake with the snake method, i was watching a kenji lopez alt video about the snake, method, i'm going to do it, i'm going to pick a day, maybe this month, have everybody over and i'm going to try to get that motherfucker, i'm going to wake up, i'm going to get my fucking alarm set and like start cooking that thing at like 6 in the morning and i'm going to try to do all day like 10 hours with the uh with the snake technique and i'll have backup if it doesn't work, i'll have like burgs and stuff, but that's that's the that's the next project grill-wise uh, i like this one uh abraham. prophets prophets ranked oh wow who who are your guys of the abrahamic i don't really like any of them honestly the whole abrahamic tradition i think it was a swing in a miss they just really i understood what they're going for like like creating an imaginative architecture to compel behavior but yeah yeah uh in the modern era over that society needs a daddy yeah and the thing is it does but it uh it it it is not. worked out, it's it's definitely led to uh, I think that, I mean, I don't, I can't, I can't really uh, say this confidently, but uh, there's there's some deep deep psychos, there's a lot of psychology, there's a ton of psychology, well I mean it's it's an attempt to, it's an attempt to uh, main, it's it's an attempt to create a unified like uh, moral, social order. out of the terror and and and uh uncertainty and uncertainty of like you know scarce tribal conflict and and in that respect it's it's it's you know it it's as inevitable as any other uh outgowth of culture but in the modern era over time the the it drags a lot it's like you know uh fast five when they rob they have the safe it's kind of the safe that's on the that's smashing around destroying everything is are driving that's a good way to describe it cuz certainly at this point and we were just talking about the trump stuff and trump and faith it it it seems like this weird especially on the political culture this weird appendage that just kind of hangs out out off the back yeah and just smashes the shit out of everything yeah someone says buddhism is a coherent philosophy for cope to which i say yes because coping is what life is yes coping is the challenge of existence life is cope life is cope what? what do you think? you think you can transcend that? you think you don't have to cope? are you fucking kidding me? then you're literally the buddha. you got a brain, you got a you got a brain made out of electrified cholesterol that is that has a fucking that has a hard deadline at which point it turns into goo, and that is also your consciousness and your understanding and the entire universe, and it's going to go away. it's going away even if you work, even if you're peter teel and you think oh no, i'll just i'll just dope myself with teenage blood until. can go into the singularity, congratulations, how long are you going to be in the computer, even if that works before the fucking silicon breaks down, even if it's 100,000 years, what happens at the end of 100,0 years, you have to cope, coping is like learning that you actually have to cope and and and accepting it that you can and breaking through the delusion that there's any way to transcend the the the trap, the the the inherent uh uh a tragic trap of existence is is is is the first step towards real maturity as a person? that's a that's a good way to spend your 20s from the endless possibility of being a teenager to the uh constrained reality of being a uh fucking finite being finite being and it's like that's there's nothing wrong with that but you have to accept it i e cope with it uh i like the person who said i am become cope yeah uh best fast food nugget uh the two that come to mind Wendy's is good i don't know the thing about the nugget is not one of my favorite fast food items but the mcdonald's nugget has the thing of being a nugget and also being a mcdonald's food which means it has that mcdonald's the patina of mcdonald's it's got that mcdonald's flavor which is unique which you can't get anywhere else and which is something that if you've had it kind of becomes a recurring craving, which is literally what they designed to be. yes, yeah, so I got to go with McDonald's because it it it satisfies that uh, that like basel desire for McDonald's chemical flavor profile, the the grimise aura, has somebody in the chat exactly, yes, you can, you, it's not that you can just taste it, you can feel the grimise, you can feel the grimice. you you eat it and you see the grimist on the just floating hovering over the horizon notding at you like uh like st dominic or or the madonna during a holy vision yes have just imagining so stricken with a stricken with malaria in a in a litter having their forehead dabbed by one of their retainers and on the horizon they they're seeing like Ignacious loyola uh uh Mary mother of God and and the grimis the grimis uh constantine uh collapsing to his knees as the grimise appears in the sky constantine at the milvian bridge looking at and there is the grimice, yes, by this sign, you shall conquer, yes, it's a big purple smiling oath, uh, what else is in here uh, do you guys like arbs? yes, arbs is good, arby's is, i'm i'm really happy that uh, bill oakley has made one of his missions to rehabilitate arbies, arbies is good, because arbies is not only is the classic roast beef sandwich with horsey sauce, just really good and something you can't really get anywhere else that no, no, it's a unique fast food thing, which is which is unique, yeah, like there's nothing unique, there's nothing unique at Wendy's, there's nothing unique at mcdonald's, there's nothing unique, you get a burger at all this place, only one place where you can get an rb, the only place you can get a pile of of thin gray uh roast beef with the horsey sauce, horse radish, the most underrated condiment, oh horse radish, can't find it at any other fucking uh uh fast food place, but they've got it out of a tap at fucking arbies, but in addition to that arbies actually has an insanely. uh uh deeply uh varied menu, they've got stuff that you got brisket, uh, they've got like Italian sandwiches, they've got like uh uh, they've got a ton of different stuff, you can't get anyone, they got mozzarella sticks, they got mac and cheese, you know what, uh, subway is uh, i want to go on duboys by the way, because weiger is a real one, i would love to, i would love to finally go on there, i don't i it seems like i don't know what i would talk about, they've talked about everything at this point, but i have a few friends who've been on duboys, maybe i'll try to get i i feel like i've dmed with weiger at some point, maybe we're trying to do a crossover at something, i do have very strong opinions on fast, the the doll boy's chapo connection has been has been needed to happen for a while, but we just really haven't - i do have very passionate views on uh on fast casual and fast uh fast food restaurants uh somebody in the chat uh i think this maybe this is a good convo to to br last one uh somebody said chris get matt to talk about music which i feel like is is one of traditional intersection so uh uh what what have you been listening to uh oh boy i just watched a movie actually last night i watched the film arkansaw i don't know what that is based on a novel uh and it was uh it stars vince vaan liam hemsworth love vince vaan uh and it's about low level drug dealers one of the most flattering things that multiple people have said is that i look like vince vaan you do kind of look i'd never thought about that but you do you're also you got the i got the tall you got the tallness yes i got like the kind of brown s the same kind of yeah the hair yes midwestern mick it's like him so that's i wouldn't bring that up unless two different people from two different sources that said that so i found that very flattering but it's a good movie and one of the things that's best about it is the soundtrack and it's got a a lot of great modern country on it and uh it has uh uh it's got a great gatlin brothers song in it that i've been thinking about ever since i saw the movie uh oh you let's talk about this in California, here's a good uh tangent, oh there's the squirrell buddy, here's a good tangent to um end on, something I think about a lot as like one of the last good days uh in the world, the day we drove from LA to Sacramento, oh god that was so fun, one of the most, it was very fun, but also one of the most psychodelic days I've ever had, because that road through California, this was been like late February when we were traveling on our California, we were talking about like whether we wanted to like take. longer to follow the coast or just go up that highway straight to sacramento and we ended up is good i like the i10 is that is that the 10 yeah yeah and we decided fuck it get there and so we went through the central valley which is like the the it's the bread basket of America it's like the industrial heartland of california but really seeing what that means going through the central valley and once you hit the main part of the 10 and just go up the middle of California that is just uh at the very edge of the... and on either side you see maybe the finest glimpse the five they're saying the five the five uh of a mountain range but until then is just endless perfectly straight industrial farms for six or seven hours and the road is perfectly straight the highway is perfectly straight uh going up the the the center of California and you're just like oh this is where all the food comes from and it's utterly inhumane it is so divorced from reality, it's like being on a food colony on Mars, yeah, yeah, no, it is a good, if you need the reminder that that the ease and convenience of American life is entirely predicated on man. massive human and animal exploitation, yeah, and the real head head, the real high point was when we drove past a a five mile wide cow cow processing cowshwits uh uh and it was we had to hold our breath for the stink and then the car smell like a but the reason i brought that up as a music discussion because that was maybe my last in addition to being one of the last notable days before uh everything collapsed and we ended quarantine was we spent the entire ride listening to Bakersfield country, outlaw country, yes uh, just all the classic merhagger type stuff from uh really good uh George Jones uh which I was aware of but had never given like a a real deep listen to and that was just will was spinning on the ones and toos buse he's a big fan of that uh Amber too Amber Amber was big in into that yeah no uh I must the the great the favorite my favorite song we listen to was the the the George. jones murl Haggard collaboration, I must have been drunk when I said I'd quit drinking, which is just a perfect, perfect, perfect country zone, perfect country title, there's another, I remember driving, I don't even know who does this, but uh, uh, I remember hearing a song while I was driving to do something in college like early in the morning, feeling bleary eyeed, weary and hearing some country on the radio called the more I drink, the more I drink, it wasn't that trip, but it was when we were in California on another drive from uh city to city that we realized that the the the cars are the west coast talking heads, remember that? well then yeah, that was that was a real like uh galaxy brain moment for all of us when we figured that one out cuuse we were like, i was like should listen to the cars or taggi heads and like nah that's a little too jittery that's a little bit too anxious for california and they're like what about the cars like yeah that's basically it's the same it's the same era it's it's the same like quality of like you know songwriting and stuff it's the same general genre. but it's got the california feel to it and of course there the cars, the cars, you got the cars, it's california, this is a little spoiler for next week's in and introducing, but we're talking about guided by voices and they have one album where they're like, fuck it, let's let's try to be a mainstream rock band and get Rick to produce it, and they have like since sounds on it and it's that same fucking since sound like, and it's like i just we just joking on the that at being like, no Rick, we want to have cinth on this on the on the album, i think that that's but like can we maybe can we change the cutoff just a little so it doesn't sound exactly like the cars synthony's like no absolutely not fuck you it's i've got my settings we're going to do that if there isn't sit you can suck my dick just what i needed you just what i all right i think i actually have to get out of here soon so i think that that may be a good place to stop this is so much fun yeah this is so good well do this again having having having someone to talk to during this and having someone to feel love cake and having i love that's my favorite b sacramento zone uh no but having somebody to like field the the the the chat and to talk with this is fantastic and if we could game too this is going to be good so stay tuned we're going to have we're going to try take the level up uh but until then good vibes bye-bye we'll see you guys in a bit thanks for uh dealing with the audio at the very beginning thank you for your patience bye bye
