 Hi guys, sorry, I'm just uh, trying to make sure that I properly credit someone for the inspiration for the episode title today, uh, uh, I was, I uh, to tweet last night about or this morning, I think actually about the debate and how the only message that either that was sent being sent there was the bodies of the two people on stage and that the message was we're dying, and someone replied with the flesh screams for those who hear it, and that's stuck in my head, and I want to give a shout out to... uh appnubs for uh for replying to me with that, because it's it's now the only thing I can think of when I think of that night, which I'm going to be thinking about a lot, because for me, let me finish this for a second, for me it delivered on everything I was hoping it would be, one second. so I know everyone and I know I was saying beforehand there's no way this thing is going to live up to what we wanted to be or what I imagine I guess what I wanted it to be and sure enough of course it couldn't because what are we waiting for we're waiting for some sort of fracture moment which will never happen because the system it's embedded and will always normalize. which is why as the thing was happening, as these two demented fossils had exactly what everybody said would happen if they ever debated, a confused, random ejaculation of of of of uh stutters and and ums and uh placeholders and circular uh wording around nothing because their heads are empty, because they're not there, they're at the point of most people's lives. where the doctors, they just give you prescriptions for anything, because hey, let them have fun with it, who cares, it does matter if they get addicted or whatever, they're not going to run out to traffic, they're at that stage, they're at the let's have fun stage of drug use for elderly people, and they're supposed to be in charge arguing about the presidency, and it took me a while obviously to realize it, and it didn't come fully to me until after I'd finished watching it. but for me anyway, this debate was that apocalyptic moment uh, not just in the sense that it has given me now a a memory, and and a memory that I can even revisit by even watching one minute, one second of the footage that will snap me out of the mental shackles of trying to invest the actions and... especially the words of either of these two people and trying to ascribe meaning to them and trying to figure out what the future of this country and this planet and myself and the people i love is based on what they say, there is nothing there, they do not know anything, they don't know where they are, and the reality of that is to terrifying to admit, so even people who were horrified by the whole thing, how many of them in the aftermath of? what we all saw decided to start arguing about whether or not Donald Trump was issuing a coded message to the proud boys to intimidate people of election sites, to which I say, did you just watch the debate? if you watch that, I don't know how you can imagine that there is any point to parsing the words that Donald Trump said in it or Joe Biden. There's no content, it is meaningless, they are syllables, this is Dutch Schultz's last words, there's plenty to be afraid about obviously. in terms of where we're headed, politically, economically, ecologically, whatever you want to, however you want to talk about it, but they, those two men are not going to be the authors of any of it, they're not going to think up anything and then make it happen, they are front pieces for systems much vaster, more horrifying than either of them could be, those are going to bring us towards our if it happens, some sort of apocalypse, but what is more likely? is just going to be the slow continuing grinding and miseration of everyone over time, which is why my main takeaway if you want me to get horse racy with it from all that is that Biden's going to win and handlely kind of make a joke of the whole thing like win by a surprising amount because when you saw that people talk about oh Trump was alpha or biden said x y z i think that Trump is not out of his desire, not out of his master plan, because he is the figure head, because he is this figure of psychic energy that so many millions of people put their focus on, either because they hate him or they love him, he he will uh, he has created a political culture now that is way overheated, like given our... crepid 300 year old fucking constitution and uh you know our non-functioning government and minority rule and all this stuff uh and the checks and the balances all that beautiful stuff that worked when the government was just a fake little ornament for all the richest dandies who uh spent too much time in the library and needed some place to hang out while the real men did the work of fucking conquering the continent like when that's what when when when part congress was just this parlor game for the wealthiest in the country where the mass majority of people were either too busy. making money or making other people money to give a shit what happened to it or even imagine what was happening there uh now it's supposed to be the actual governing body of a fucking world bestriding colossus at this point uh and and and all of these populations that in the American uh the early American era under the early constitution. We're not even part of the political uh calculus, like native Americans, like African Americans, like women, are now part of it, all of that increases the cultural heat, but what's driving the cultural heat is immiseration is how bad everything is for people day-to-day, not just the cheeto and chief and not shit on tv, lived motherfucking experience, it's worse for people than it has been in this country for a very long time, and only gets worse. and so Trump is this figure who is like he's the sorcer's apprentice rising up these giant gusts of of popular animists both against him and for him that cannot be contain by our rickity as constitutional system. they are out of proportion, the question is really are they out of proportion to the crisis in the system or does Trump provide a specific enhancer and i think we're going to find out on election day obviously forget about... coo and countercoo and proud boys at the ballot box, i think the most likely thing that's going to happen is the rubber is going to meet the road and it was meter has as bad as it is for people in this country, it's still relative to everyone else in the world pretty damn good and now more than ever we're no we know that we know we have still have something to lose even the people among us who are suffering because you're not suffering as much as somebody waiting to get in this country on the other side of the border fence or somebody fucking in a dingy in the met and so and of course we have the fact that we've depoliticized have to put people to don't not even see a political answer to any of these problems. i think that we're all going to look at ourselves and trump will be the option of keeping ringing the bell and keep it frenzy, this frenzy of urgency, and i think that a good enough people are just going to say, no, no. no, we're not, do we really want to cuz if we real, if Trump's president, we're going to eventually have to have a civil war, like we're going to have to have one, forget the material conditions, Trump being president will stoke us beyond everything, and we will make that leap into action and violence, and then people will see other people do it and be inspired and join and join, and you actually could have a civil war, but I don't think people want one, not the people who vote in this country, I don't really think they do, and I think that sure you us, obviously none of this. to Trump's base because obviously it doesn't saying that point doesn't mean anything, I'm saying for the people needs to elect him, I think more are going to be like, yeah, no, this is not, I'm not going to get a gun. I'm not going to stand in front of a walmart trying to fend it off from uh BLM or whatever the fuck i i don't want to do that and bien is the alternative to that and that's why I think he's probably going to win and kind of maybe hilariously by a big margin like he's at the cuffs now in these pollings of going between like a clear electoral win and just a blow up now of course obviously polls pulls anything can happen but I think that people just like ask yourself this question do you feel like we're in the mid conditions to have an actual materially based civil war as in as in a battle over resources, not ideas, battle over resources in this country when there's still fucking mountain dew coming out of the taps, you really think that's true or is the orange man screaming noises that we're all trying to listen to and make sense of, but are noises, animal noises, hunks, hanks and utterrances, it's like we made like a fucking a pig that like... wandered into the uh the the distillery shed and like ate some fermented pumpkins and it's now shit faceed is wandering around the fucking uh backyard and you all decide that he's a he's a learned pig and you're going to gather around him and listen to his oinkings and try to figure out what he's saying and then he's going to be in charge and what he says is in charge that's where we are with Trump I think people are going to say uh no nah let's just turn it down t fuck and it's bad and fucking corona and all that but do i do i want to get shot no and but this comes to the real like revelation point i had after after this whole happ this whole thing happened is like when i say i think biden is going to win based on the debate it's not based on anything that was said by either of them and there's no point in parsing anything they say that that was my great revelation, that i don't have to, and i'm going to try not to, and you guys can yell at me if i don't, i will try not to talk anymore in public or even as little as i can to myself and my own internal fucking monologue about uh Trump's statements, about biden's statements, about what they mean, about what he's signaling, about, nope, the stakes are still high and saying, saying that doesn't mean don't care about the election, of course care about the election, the stakes are very high, i just said we keep Trump in here, we could push past a precipice just because of how hypersaturated with politics every fabric of culture became becomes under him, it could happen, i'm betting though that there's still enough elastic, there's still enough resistance in the band before the snapback in terms of material conditions in this country where you're never more than 300 fucking uh feet from ataco bell or you can get in a car to get one and as much as there's so misery in this country, the most deeply abject misery in this country is felt by people who aren't involved in any of this and don't vote and don't aren't even aware of this bullshit and sure shit aren't listening to the fucking president to hear the coded messages to his army of of nazis or whatever the fuck so if you want to do horse race stuff you can look at polls and you can't just take a temperature temperature check of where you think the material conditions are, you don't have to care about any of this, and you can be entertained by it, but you cannot try to pull meaning out of it, and there is a distinction there, because the moment that really what got me there is that I did in fact do a lot of drugs for, I'll fair fair cop it right now, for the um, for the debate because it did seem like this, like this thing coming together, these two guys it's so symbolically frated that I'm like, okay, I I have to know what this is, and it has to mean something to me, I have to get meaning out of this, because if my life, which has been organized around things like this, having meaning, like my professional life, and before that, my my my spiritual life, I guess you would call it, before I really knew I even had one, like my attempt to grasp towards politics, uh, and I got it because what I found myself doing in the middle of the bate, debate was being caught between the the... the totalized moment of these guys yelling at each other and Chris Wallis piping in from the sidelines and just having overwhelmed me the sense of like how how hilariously fraudulent the entire terms of this are like this was an Emperor's not croll's moment of oh yeah these guys aren't in charge of anything these guys don't run shit and so what is it fucking matter what they say uh and that was smashing a against my need to like deliver commentary and like respond and that would get me connected to like fact checker brain and like trying to put these in retorical like well said that and who's going to benefit from that and imagining what joe six think? even though I don't know the fuck that is, it's just me, that those two things couldn't be containd in the same moment, or I tried to, I held them in my head as long as I could during the course of the debate, and then afterwards I just had to sit with myself and be like, okay, you can hold those two thoughts together as much as you think you can, you cannot keep them together, because you will lose the deeper realization, because I could find my, I could feel myself getting pulled towards foren'. a dissection of this shit like trying to fucking uh uh do an autopsy on a turd and i said no no no oh that's just going to make this worse because you find yourself this anxious point waiting to try to figure out what's being said because you can never know you can't know oh uh he was signaling to the prob boys they're going to show up and kill everyone on election day how will you know that until it happens or not you will have no way of knowing you are just you're you're shifting through that. fucking chicken guts to try to to auger out a fucking uh auspice and i realized as soon as i saw people talking about uh well did uh does he signal to the proud boys i don't know i think he was being mistaken and that was actually two different questions it's like that's q that thinking is q and on thinking even if it's coming from people who are politically sophisticated and fact-based and reasonable and on the left like the actual like serious left not even the liberal left. uh, that's Q thinking, that's what the queue people do, and that's what we're all going to do, all the politically minded people do, as politics detaches farther and farther away from material conditions, becomes more and more aspectle that we have to invest with, uh, we will all turn into queue, if we keep our mind on these, these things having semantic weight, these specific terms and words and phrases having meaning that we have to decifer instead of their being just a totalizing reality, buse that's what q people q'. people are in that same box, like they recognize the sham, you know, like they don't understand the terms of it, they think it's satanic pedophiles or something instead of capitalists, but they understand the terms and that this country that they think they live in is a nightmare, and someone is making that way, someone with power, like they do recognize that there's power there, they just don't know where the power is because of they're fucking Americans, and they're getting all their shit from the fucking shit tube, but they're also... so from that realization, trying to get to truth through discrete decoding of the words of people like Donald Trump, and so that's how you get them saying like, oh, everyone's all the pedophiles are going to get executed uh in March 15th, because look at the three letters that he uh misspell, three words he misspelled in this tweet and how it spells out that date or whatever, that's the same thing, it's not as deluted, but it is on a continuum of abstraction. towards just self-destroying hysteria to go through his phrases, going through the sentences, he said, did any of them complete a sentence in that, did anyone actually have a now a fucking verb uh, like in the right order in in a fucking thing, like subject, object, per big letter at the front, period at the end, did any of them have a complete sentence in the entire event, there can be no meaning drawn from those things. and that means we are no, that means we have to disengage from it as as at this point, because we're not really powerful, we're all waiting for election day basically, we're treating it as uh an auspice, we're treating it as a as like the the the musings of like the oracle of delphi after they got her hopped up on mushrooms, we're we're trying to hear the future, but we can't know it from that, we can't know, we can't know the future, we can only know what's around us and the people we love, the world we want to see and how we can try to make use all the things around us to make that happen, so if you want to watch the debate, i'm going to keep watching the debates, i'm going to keep talking about this election, but i'm going to make it considered effort to remove it entirely from any kind of uh context of uh politic'. meaning, it is entirely aesthetic, aesthetic appreciation, because I'm sorry, people who are into politics aren't only into politics because they care about people, not like those guys with like sports, there's an aesthetic appreciation of politics just as much as their for sports, and so if we can isolate it, and use it in that way, then we can engage with it, but if we take. if we take this these fucking gibbrish and we try to just rearrange the letters into coherence that is just being provided by our own neuroses. because it's just a reflection of what we're thinking, it's not really there, and we're not coordinating with anybody, we're not checking our work against one another, we're all making independent judgments and then bashing each others against one another, so yeah, I was very pleased with it afterwards, I mean uh, I tweeted right afterwards as a joke, I said it on the stream. said the real winners of tonight debate were the American people because of how hilariously the wrong that was, but um as you see people really freaking out after that debate being like oh my god oh my god hyperventilating one way or the other uh i think it really was good for uh the winner really was the American people just because i'm not going to say it's going to be you know some uh some wake-up moment for a lot of people but it was for me in just in a sense that it took something i knew but only intellectually and now maybe you feel it, which is all real knowledge is, it's not reciting, it's not having a dry axium, it is experiencing that in your life and then associating it with specific feelings, context, memories that can then keep you there, they can, when you find yourself straying, bring it back, and that is what that uh debate did for me uh, and and if you were, if you had eyes to see, it did it for you too, not saying, but I of course was in a very specific situation to be in that way, I cheated, I cheated, I did a bunch of drugs uh, and that because I'm a cheater, because I'm a bounder, because I'm laush, because I'm a fucking, I'm a neechi's last man, I'm a fucking small soul bug creature over here, of course I cheated, that's one of the reasons that drugs, psychodelic drugs are so dangerous uh, sort of like your long-term mental health uh is because what they essentially do in terms of your body, in terms of your like body chemistry is they put you in a super advanced state of meditative focus, the kind that can be usually only attained by incredibly, incredibly, incredibly determined pursuit, and it just pops you there, like within half an hour taking it, problem with that is is that that deep meditative state, that deep. sensory awareness, that perception of everything around you that happens a deep deep level of concentration, where you start noticing the poorestness of all these like perceived uh distinctions and and and you truly feel the imminence, you know, god's grace if you want to be christian about it or just the just that hum, the universal hum of the of the thing that you're all always been a part of and you're going to return to and you're not even not part of now and it's all an illusion, you feel that, now if you feel that in a state of that you uh, if you get that from intense concentration, which has uh been achieved through discipline, you're in a position to do something useful with that feeling. you are sitting probably on a mountaintop somewhere in a situation, maybe monastic or some sort of pursuit of you know your personal study, it has integrated your life, it has made you live a life that has enough space in it for you to dedicate that much time to being alone and sitting. and thinking and and controlling your surroundings, which means when you get that insight, you can imprint it on the world as it is. if you get that deep meditative state overnight like that, without the discipline as uh as Dr. the discipline necessary to attain it, then you have that perception surrounded by what, what got you there, what got you to that moment, it wasn't fucking rigorous pursuit of anything, it was flight from this, it was light from truth and so what are you seeing now with that deep meditative fixation of of sense? you're seeing these screaming goblins in front of you, that's dangerous, but it can be good too, if you can recognize the goblins for what they are, and not decide that the symbolic abstraction thing, and and and have that be adhered to to that sense, that feeling. of oneness that that really does transmit knowledge, because now instead of learning, oh yeah, this is a puppet show, you're learning know the puppets are talking to me, i'm the only one knows what they're really saying, so all in all good debate, had a fun time, looking forward to the next ones, uh, i think that pence and harris are going to be hilarious because there's going to be a ton of pressure to make that one normal to reassure people abnormality and uh it'll be funny to see how how that plays out? i will say that uh people are mad at Nancy pelosi for saying that thing about how we need we need a good republican party and you know what, from her perspective, she's 100% correct, she's not saying anything long? what she's saying is that because we do not have two parties, right? fighting overpower, we have two branches of a broader capitalist party whose conflicts are stage managed to avoid discussions of deeper. for structural issues, we cannot afford to have wild uh uh unstable polarization whereby people won't accept the division of government like the sea sawing back and fornismo as they used to call it in uh in 19th century Spain that allows the pressures the social pressure should oh all those democrats are pretty mad well we'll get a democrat the white house they won't be mad anymore all these republicans are pretty bad don't worry we'll get a democrat in there and that's that's the that's what keeps the the the lungs moving, the lungs of democracy moving, and Trump is threatening that, he's legitimately threatening that, he is raising the stakes emotionally for politics in a way that our system uh does not want, which is why I think that Push comes to shove, he's going to go and go quietly because he's a fucking pussy, you think he has the guts to tell the beautiful generals what to do if they tell him they're not going to fucking support him, give me a break, i'm not even like fuck that like fucking mitch maconlely. probably wouldn't even fucking say boodoo, but again the answers to these things are not to be found in discussions of the statements of any of these jibbering, escapes from arress home, i'm sorry guys, it's it's magic hour back. here but it makes it hard to hard to post, this is all right, so so I hope now it'll be very interesting for me to try to watch these debates with this in mind, like with this focusing agent in mind that will allow me to avoid the temptation to turn myself into queue by trying to pull. ah and the beauty of this is is that even if it wasn't even if watching that debate wasn't like revelatory to you, if you listen to what I'm saying or you hear somebody else say a similar thing and it makes sense to you, hopefully that memory connected to the debate, like the reality of that debate and the memory of watching it can provides at least a fresh. that is provided for me in terms of what i hope to be a practice of avoiding going down this fucking rabbit hole because all it does is lead me farther from knowing what i'm talking about because it's all bullshit it's all conjecture wondering what someone else is going to do who isn't you which you can't know it's not it structure it's all right remember we're not talking about we're talking about what is what are these words going to lead to other people doing that's not at the level here that we need to be talking about. mocket is the the tr is the bag that so what i do is strip the back put it inside and just cut it i Oh man, the sun is really pursuing me across this place here. All right, that's not too bad. So I don't know what anyone else's experience was, but for me, very, very uh. very good, and I'm very much looking forward to watching these the rest of these debates through that lens and using my memory of the first one to pull myself out of uh out of the spiraling, because it really does more than anything, just make it harder like for me, my job, I do, I do care about like being right, you know, because I care about conveying things that are helpful, both you know in terms of entertainment, but also if it's going to be practical in any way, not wrong, and every time I find myself getting into these discussions, I've noticed and this like thinking back on it, I noticed even more. even as it was happening, was feeling the anxiety build up, but I wasn't really acknowledging or understanding where it was coming from, it was because as I was trying to build up around these specific questions, I would keep bumping up against this uh insecurity in my understanding, because it was based on nothing, I was just guessing, I was guessing what other people were going to do, and all I can do but to do that is like, well what if I was somebody else, how would I have imagined that uh, what would that make me do? You can't... ask that question, how can you ever ask that question? that's why you have to materially analyze things and and i just never it didn't occur to me how deeply that implications of that run, because the implications of that really are that you you can't think about what these guys are saying along about what it means, but what people are going to take from it, because you can't know what people are going to take from it, and so i find myself. I would find myself getting agitated and and like starting to wonder, well maybe I'm not good at this, maybe I'm be doing a bad job, maybe I'm hurting people, by giving them bad advice because I don't even know, and it's because I'm I'm wiley coyote running off the cliff with my fucking legs blasting around, not recognizing that the goddamn grown is gone, and it's not that it's not that these guys words don't have meaning like Trump's Trump's stoking of like resistance he's going to get keep people killed 1 million percent he is going to get people killed obviously he's already got people killed he will get more people killed when i say he will i mean in the sense of yes someone you will hear what he says and yes he will use that as excuse to go do violence 100% i think that will happen but when i imagine that that's just because i still have to imagine than someone else, but the question I can't answer is how many, how many boils down to demographic questions, how many people are in x position to have y response when they get z stimuli in the form of Trump speeches? and without that information I cannot move forward, and maybe that information is available, but I think more realistically for me, just cut it off, get rid of it, throw it in the gap. aesthetically appreciate it, maybe, but remove the the the flush, remove the flush of uh of consequence, make it into a game and not war, like material stuff should be war always and at war, you are sharpest, you know, but but if you're war in the clouds, you will you'll go mad. so while it's horrible to imagine violence happening because of these awful words of this awful man, we have to ask ourselves, what can we do about it, we can vote, and if you that if that mean seems consequential to you, for the love of God, do it, but beyond that, all we can really do is help the people around us. and see what those connections lead to, where our abilities, skills, passions, uses can be applied, we can't know that from looking at the chicken guts and and trying to see the flight of the fucking uh ravens over the fucking uh forum uh someone. uh first episode of season four four fargo sucked got to say agree uh not not looking forward to this season boy uh i will say that um in fairness i don't think last season started terribly strong but i do think the second half of the third season of fargo is the best the show ever was imo in the first three seasons it just ended so great uh so maybe they'll bring it around but the first two episodes were uh were a and it's not because oh they're finally addressing race, it's the way they do it, the way they do it is the way everybody does it, so it's boring, there's nothing unique to it, there's nothing interesting to it, and that's because clearly Noah Holly didn't care about this stuff, but it's now being imposed by an expectation culturally, and now he's doing something he doesn't really believe in, I think buse it just feels so hollow, and uh that means should there be a show about a mob war but uh involving like a a a a black uh gang family that like involves you know the deep questions of American'. racial history and hierarchy and like what whiteness is and all that stuff and how that like relates to the mid-western identity, very interesting questions, clearly though, he's not the guy to ask them, buse it's not, not because he couldn't in some abstract sense like he doesn't have the talent to, it's clearly not what's interesting, it's not what got him into the project, but that and that's why we get worse art. as things get more like woke, but the wokeness isn't what makes it bad, it's because instead of a lot a thousand flowers blooming like different creators of different uh uh experiences and lived identities being able to create in an open marketplace, well that's not what we have, that's not our culture is and that's not how media is created, media is concentrated by firms, capitalist nodes that sit is gatekeepers and like all capital uh nodes is just a fucking pop tiled high with uh accumulated and passed down wealth from the first generations of people to put take power there and hold it, I e white people, so when the cultural winds move in the direction of wanting to see voices, wanting to see alternatives and and and the whole color of life, instead of getting experiences from people of all those color of life, inflecting this art, we get the same old fucking suits and the same old cotier of professionals with maybe a trickling in of diversity hires and affirmative action cases in order to like asswage everybody's conscience and feel less guilty about themselves, they're going to tell those stories even though they don't speak to anyone with a creative spirit involved in the productions at all, it's purely impulled compelled from without, it doesn't come from within, it doesn't come from. those other perspectives that are supposed to be viewed, because when we're watching Marvel movies, we're not really watching representation, like yes, Ryan Kougler is black, you know, but uh, the marvel machinery that made Black Panther is not black in any meaningful cultural sense, and and and and Ryan Couler specific blackness, or the writers specific blackness or uh, Frank Ocean's specific blackness, they cannot overcome the corporate. swill, they're get, they get their their genuine uh passion for it, which is real, is diluted, because they're cogs in a giant machine, and so everything, all the culture gets worse, and it gets more inclusive and more cynically inclusive, and people say see that and say, ah, it's the inclusion that makes this bad, no, it's not the inclusion that makes it bad, it's the way that the inclusion is being infused into this capitalist edifice through. compelled cynical utilization, which is a greater sign of just capital accumulation strangling art more broadly, because the stuff that the anti uh woke people hate or love in culture, like guys being dudes and and exploding cars and ownage and all that shit that I also dearly dearly love, if that stuff is pursued in this context of maximal bottom line and maximal capital uh concentration at the top and the need for like PG13. as to be the the sort of collective understood uh uh goal uh rating for every movie that's that has it more than a few like dollars a pocket change committed to the budget of from a major studio that's gonna suck too man that would suck ass, it would just suck in a way that would be harder for those guys to notice. but and I'm not saying that people aren't going to be moved by something like black panther, that's how bad it is, that's how deeply entrenched racism is at all levels of culture, and how little representation, real representation any minority seees in this fucking uh eye of saron of like whiteness and printing on everything, of course you see like anything looks like uh the fucking a crack of light. through the uh to the doorway looks like the fucking sunrise and no one, I don't begrudge anybody that I'm just talking about the general trend of everything getting worse and then being things being indulged in by the stuts as a way to get some people on board more than they would otherwise, you're alienating some, but you're getting others on board and the and the and the the market equation is in the long run demographically, hey Who are we going to make more money with catering to? the rising diverse young people of America or uh white incells who make up like the preponderance of the cultural conversation online about media, where are you putting your money as a capitalist edifice? this is a no-brainer, that just means that preponderantly we're going to see worse woke stuff, but as things are worse and worse for people, it's going to look more consequential to people seeking anything else to me anything than the fucking bullshit awfulness of their lives. Thank you for the hair, thank you, the haircut, I did it myself, I got to say, very, at the beginning of quarantine and was, and I think I said it on an early couple early streams, I was like 50/50 uh, at least already at that point that I was going to shave my head at some point, which I think is the guy's version of quarantine bangs and I was like, I'm going to do it, I'm going to buzz this remnant, this forlor. hope here uh, but I always assumed I'd get drunk and do it one night, but you know, I stopped drinking so much more than anything really, and I realized I never got to that point, and I'm glad, I feel like uh, it means I never really hit bottom, even if things looked a little shaky from time to time, or at least my bottom was higher than shaving my head, I guess it just means I'm blessed more than anything. I do have a square head kind of right? I'm a square head pretty much. One time Amber found a picture from Ells Island online of a guy in like a Bavarian dude in laterhosen who had come and like the... 1800s uh through Dallas Island and she and he was uncanny, he looked exactly like me, it was one of those nick cage time traveler memes i I got to find it and post it sometime again, she had it on uh Twitter once, but of course her account's been nuked for a long time, maybe she has, I'll find it somewhere, I don't know if I can google matthew Chrisman, Bavarian oaf and find it. Oh yeah, I get to finally uh, we have my uh lawn a waited opinion on the euro cake, somebody uh posted in the chat a Euro cake that I clicked on and it brought me to what looked like just 3 eur stacked on top of one another basically that presumably you cut into slices and eat instead of just wrapping around, I found it underwhelming. uh somebody asked if good morning Sunday morning was q and on code to the left you know. No, but give it a few years, like Nancy stays in power say, like Biden gets in there and you get the lid on a little bit, and we kick the can down the road a little bit more because that's just what we're doing, we're just pushing crises past the horizon, we're and that's all it's going to be, that's literally what capitalism is, from crisis to crisis, there's no long-term plan, there can't be, it's just the value form annihilating all meaning and and all. life, things are going to be bad enough that the democratic voters are going to get more so ensorceled that they're going to have the same reverence and like fixated opinion on and analyzing of everything that one of their leaders does, so yeah, like when 95-year-old Nancy Pelosi is still uh speaker of the house when it which has been like relocated to Banger Maine because the entire eastern seaboard south of the... uh Baltimore is gone uh she'll they will be scrying her words for meaning the way that uh the queue people do for Trump good morning sami morning I love that so much why why why what I can't she's still a mystery in me. cuz you know it all those people are, it's all gerntocracy, it's all just people losing their marbles, and then of course there's Bernie, who will people point out is just as old, but have you ever noticed that he's completely with it, and you know why? because he's... is grounded because unlike those psychos he knows he's going to die and he wants it to mean something and that's why he's not lost in in in anywhere but himself because in himself is can't he can't bear it he cannot bear to be himself if you're if you're donald trump or you're Joseph biden you can't bear to be yourself because you spent your entire lives focusing yourself completely and totally around acquisition built around an individual ego and the maintenance of and and and uh so far down that it's driving you insane, it's driving you insane, that's what that's what's pushing, obviously like you know bodily entropy does a lot to it, but there's something else. driving it, there's something also pushing the fucking uh play-doh through the the tube that like you know the grape to make it give it a different shape and that is this this flee fl this flight away from the reality of their mortality. Bernie on the other hand, he doesn't have the ghosts that they do, he is not reed by uh, by like the the scores of uh, you know, the scores of victims. at least not as many, of course, obviously, you know, he's he's a senator, he ran for president, he's got blood on his hands the way anybody in power does, but he truly, I believe, did those in a pursuit of a greater goal, and I think that is what keeps him now, that's what keeps him here, that's what keeps him on point, because he doesn't have to flee from the moment where he's dying, he can stay in the moment, because yeah he's dying, so I got stuff to do. neither Biden or Trump can be in the moment because the moment is death, the moment is decrepitude, the moment is confusion, fear, dimming, bodily failure and the terror that cannot be felt, because it is everything, it was totalizing, it's death itself, because it's right there, Nancy, and I feel like because I'm a guy, I think, I get Trump and Biden's specific cenial. like flight from uh from the moment of mortality, but polosi because I think she's a woman and you know there's certain experiences that aren't known from one or the other of those divides, uh, she ends up going, good morning, Sunday morning, but it's the same thing, I think, it's the same phenomenon, but um, Yeah, buse, you know, we all think of the the real horror of life is the knowledge that we're going to die someday, and that's not really it, it's the fact that we once again have two things that are true that we're trying to hold in our head simultaneously. The one thing we're trying, we're keeping in our head that we think is true, is the culturally imposed idea that we're going to die someday in the future, which I believe is sitting on top of a deeper biological understanding that we all already die. everyone has already died, this has all happened before, it will all happen again, these universe that we're in has winked out of existence, countless times, you have already your gravestone has both dates on it, all of ours do, eternal recurrence, baby, and the thing is, if you know that, if you have that. that in the background, the way that when you watch a debate you have the knowledge that this doesn't have any syntactic meaning to it in the background, living becomes much easier, and you know, it's like you're on flight 93 and it's going into the fucking uh the field, like there's no thing that ends with anything other than the fucking plane crashing and you dying, the only thing that matters is are you at the chair bashing your head in terror against the glass? just screaming, your mind annihilated with a fear that you can't even comprehend, or are you this the actual flight 93 itself, are you aware, are you able to connect emotion and intellectual belief in symbolic order in such a way to believe the fundamental truth that you're not fucking separated from anything and that there's nothing to lose, there is no such thing as death. but that's very hard to keep in mind when you live in this world that insists you every moment of the day in every interaction you have that strips you of your species being. whips it from you, tears it from you like your skin off your fucking body, like you're a flayed man of house bolton and replaces it with this, no you're gonna die someday, you're gonna end, this is gonna be over, which flees you, which which leads you in the terrible skinner box where all you're really doing is fleeing from, fleeing from towards desire and away from uh towards pain and away from pleasure, or towards pleasure and away from pain. which means you do not have any independence, you are literally an automat, you are, you're a mechanical symbol monkey, and we all are ruled by that to an extent, I mean we do know we're here, we do know that when we end, they're not getting any more of this, we know that that's true, but the degree to which that matters is the degree to which we can live connected to that other knowledge, and the guys like Trump and guys like... biten have spent their entire life banging their heads with a fucking ladle to keep them on the path of acquisition of power and respect and money and their dad's head pats or whatever they think heaven is, instead of knowing that it's right there, always in any moment, we're always right there, grace is there, the hand is there, you can fall, you'll never land, you'll always be held as you're falling. and that's the realization that can that robs that robs the questions of our life, what to do with the time we do have of their mystifying bedevilments, things that make us make wrong decisions, uh, emotions clouding us, memories of previous events that are going to guide us in an event that doesn't need that, that can be answered in the moment, but that's overwhelmed. the task of building a sane and humane society is building one where that that knowledge can be accessible to more people because the more accessible it is the more people will not need to be governed by an external authority like the market and fucking value form lording over us is like an actual molac death god it will be because we have stripped our death days of the need to pile up and not be in the moment where everything is cuuse we know for a fact that like when you cry it's not because you feel sad, you feel sad after you cry, like we know that for a fact because of the delay of signal, it's inevitable, it's quantum question, so we aren't actually in charge of any of this, like we don't we can't aparate from that perspective cuuse we have to look. live, but it's true, and if we're aware of that truth, it makes it easier to act in, that is, do what you should be doing, and not try to bang against that destiny, because you can move one foot in front of front of the other as long as you're looking down, but if you're looking everywhere else, you're going to fucking wander off into the wilderness. someone saying tell everyone else how to live, that's the thing, I'm not telling anybody else how to live, the whole point of all of this is telling you that I can't tell you how to live, that you have to know how to live, we all have to figure it out ourselves, and right now. that makes sense to me to do with whatever I find myself with in possession of the of the moment, this this this platform, this career, lauffably called such, this skill set developed in the pursuit of those things, what do I do with them, right now this is what makes sense to do with them, and I have to trust that if that feels like it's not true anymore, that I can divorce myself from the need to acquire the moment. the need to dis uh to distort my vision of what's in front of me by the fear of lacking something in the future uh and then you can fucking act as in act according to where you should do what what should be happening the the way the golden path that's always there so I'm not telling anybody how to live for the love of God the only thing I ever say is what boils down to the same thing every time I say about it and everything i said today about the fucking election, all boills down to the same dumb two words, log off, and i know hypocrite of hypocrites, i'm doing this, i know, i know, but you could not tell when you say log off. "you can't just smuggly say that's it, because that is asking people to essentially withdraw, go through withdraw system, withdraw symptoms of I can't even imagine the monstrosity of which I haven't been able to cut off the internet, and I tell myself it's just because of my job, but I also find an allure there, I also find find this this this sinful uh dump of of emotional energy, I find that that that tantalizing, and so I engage from that perspective." like i try to sween myself, so i that's why it always ends up having to be turned into these longer diet tribes coming at it from different angles to make up one great big banal truth that is the whole sum of like the uh uh praxis of this fucking show, log off, what that means to you, what you can take, what steps you can realistically take as opposed to, no, i'm going to fucking, i'm going to get dts for the next the next five months out of some uh, how would i even be able to sustain the faith to keep going with that kind of hardship? you'd never be able to do it, i know i wouldn't be, i know i wouldn't be, that's all i can say, like you the faith, the faith that's there has to be uh in some way rewarded, or else the the horrors of the world will overwhelm your defenses and will take you out of the moment. and uh, everything else is entertainment, like I said, so there's one big thing you get out of a thing like the debate, and it's there's no meaning here, one, but then there's the the aesthetic enjoyment of watching it play out and making fun of it and stuff like that, drained of meaning, same thing, but drained of rather uh, drained of not drained of meaning if to you know take it, but drained of um import, it's play instead of war, like I'm saying, the war is log off, just like the war of the election was stop listening to these people, everything else is entertainment, and if you find it entertaining, and I think it's, I think it's probably better than yelling at people on twitter for an hour, watching this, I think is better than yall on twitter for an hour, I will, I will flatter myself to say that. and if you're going to do that instead of that, I mean I know that that's self rational, that's rationalizing to me, rationalizing to people who do it, but those sort of reward uh uh negotiations with oneself are what give you the lee way to find, oh this isn't as bad as I thought it would be, oh look, I'm rewarded in this way with this, instead of just having this giant void that has to be filled immediately, when you don't know how to do that yet, you can work your way towards it, as we all do, weaning ourself off. All right, did that make sense guys? I like kind of, someone said kind of. Okay, I think that's what. I usually end up, I mean that's what I'm aiming for, perfect, perfect understanding is impossible, total gibbrish, I wouldn't like that either, that's self-indulgent, kind of right in the middle, that's what I should always be shooting for, because if I don't if I shoot for perfect, I'm going to turn into Jibrish and if I just shoot for uh, you legibility over anything, it it robs it of any content, so I'm going to end up uh... outkicking my coverage on some concepts, someone says uh see uh mik's 13 assassins i highly recommend that movie, that was a really good uh recommendation for that person, strong pick. I have never had carvel in my life, I live briefly in uh Long Island and I still never had carvel, it just never appealed to me, I've never been a, it's not that I don't like ice cream cake, if you give me an ice cream cake, hell yeah, I'm gonna eat it, but I never crave it, I'm not gonna get my own ice cream cake, that would be crazy. I would be a different person if i bought my own ice cream cake. Does logging off mean to stop watching kush vlogs? eventually, probably, yeah, I would say yes, when that comes, that's an individual decision, just like mine will will end at some point with me stopping doing them, like that's inevitable too, and we have to accept that, yeah, oh, this already happened, this already ended, hopefully it ended because, hopefully it ended because oh, we don't need it anymore, and not because oh, he tried to crack the universe and uh, you know, ended up running noon down the Atlantic. um running neon down Atlantic Avenue uh or just like tried to ignore the voice in my head trying to get things across and just indulge myself and try to track myself and just end up keiling over uh after like an RB's gorge. I would not like it to end that way, I would like it to end on my own terms in the sense that I I don't need to make these anymore because some i have something else in my life that fills that spot. and I have to just tr trust that if I earnestly and with good faith address the day, I will know it when it comes, does anyone know the score in azerbaijan uh Armenia, anyone who's up on that one? What's the spread by the way? All right, I think that was about an hour, sometimes I really fly, well talk to you guys, hopefully soon, we'll see, uh, and can't wait for the next debate, honestly, it's going to be a real uh experiment, seeing how I uh, I get around to... dealing with just letting it wash over me completely, just letting it all wash over me so that it's just noises and then I can just distinguish the noises by amusement to me. Bye guys!
