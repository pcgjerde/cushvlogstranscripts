 one down of the big lake they call gichigumy, lake it is said never gives up it's dead when the skies of November turn gloomy with a load of iron or 26,000 tons more than the admin fits gerald weight empty, that good shipping true was a bone to be chewed when the gales of November cane early bow. The ship was the pride of the American. inside coming back from somewhele in Wisconsin. As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most, the crew and good captain, well season, concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms, when they left fully loaded for Cleveland, and later that night, when the ship bell rang, could it be the north when they were feeling. the wind and the wires made a tattle bail sound and a wave broke over the railing and every man knew as the captain did to was the witch of November come steel in the on came play the breakfast had to wait when the gales of November came slashing when afternoon came it was freezing rain and the face of a hurricane westwind. when suppertime came the old cook came on x saying fellows it's too rough to feed you at 7 pm the main hatchway gaved in he said fellows it's been good to know you the captain wired in he had water coming in and the good ship and crew was in peril and later that night when his lights went out of side came the wreck of the edman fitzgerald. RIP, RIP to a legend, we love the edmon fits jeral, don't we? Wisconsin, yes, Wisconsin does bait border Lake Superior, there uh, the very north, there's a coast along uh the lake superior side, on the other side. of uh the upper peninsula, so between the upper peninsula and like Minnesota, i think, i'm not actually very well traveled in Wisconsin, i have to be honest, i really did cling to the the lower coastal corridor. because Wisconsin like a lot of those midwestern states, it's a lot of different uh places, you know, they don't necessarily interact a lot, like for example, I grew up saying, I referred to uh things like Coca-Cola as soda growing up, which is very true of the coasts, but in the mid-west, it's supposed to be pop, my cousins who grew up about an hour to the northwest of me in the... uh fox river valley, they all said pop, and they would come to manand walk and they would say soda, they would say pop and be like, what the fuck are you talking about? so like the west western part by the that's by the river instead of the lake i have no idea what's going on over there, i think that's like mostly square heads right, it's like luthrans, it's basically interchange. from Minnesotans, where they say pop? we're essentially more uh, more urbanized, more acculturated into urbanity maybe, i don't know, because is known as an agricultural hub right, the dairy land, but along the coast, those are all uh, there's not a lot of farming going on. That's more traditional commercial ventures and you've got you, Milwakee is sort of the farthest west, right? I'd say that Milwake is the fartest west and north Rustbelt city uh, and even the town I come from, Mandedwalk, which is an hour and a half north and is not uh very big, it's like 30,000 people, but it had its own uh mini Rust belt industrial economy around ship build. uh and then heavy manufactury and light manufacturing so there's like manaduak uh there's this big company that made yats after world world war 2 saw make half of the US submarine fleet and then after the war it was a ship building place but there was also like manaduaka cranes and heavy machinery and fucking uh the ice machines pots and pans plant. Yeah, I don't think Minneapolis St. Paul had the industrialization that Milwaake did, like Milwaake had had a real industrial base going there in the monotomy river valley uh and it brought with it you know a urbanized population and it got for example like I'd say one thing about that I marks a rustbelt city is that it had a... significant urban uh black diaspora population show up sometime around world war world war 2 and after the second great great migration if you didn't have that i don't think you really qualified as rust belt because that is where uh the last places where capital was developing and where people could move to be a new urban proletariate with an expectation that they would be able to get a job. Minnesota didn't really have that there uh yeah like it happened way later like like uh as the industrialization was already taking root so so Milwakee had a real industrial economy uh but it was one of the smallest one of the last sort of a throw off of Chicago uh place that as soon as you know the engine of industrial manufactury as economic engine as soon as that engine is removed the idea of making stuff in in the uh manner that it is done in American urban heartland you know the places that build things the places where the labor peace was signed after World War II yeah didn't do industrialism, they'd had the mills, that's what you had, that's that's that's like before the factories get there, you get the mills, the mills are supposed to like, but they never got there, the the crest receited before it could get to Minneapolis, yeah somebody's talking about how the in mandad you could get six dues. before they take your license for a long time, well after it was uh banned other places, it was not first defense drunk driving was not a crime in Wisconson, I think until the 80s or 90s, the federal government had to threaten uh them with taking their highway funding away, which they also had to do to get them to lower the uh raise the drinking age to 21, but first defense drunk driving was not something that you could get booked for basically, you just get sent home. so that i i grew up sort of in the in the shadow of Rustbelt Wisconsin and it didn't really get farther much farther than that, you've got Milwaaki, you've got you know the the the little off shoots north of it uh green bay being one, but miwakey is like the the center of this, and it's where you get uh the real of social life in Wisconsin in the form of large uh uh influx of of African Americans, that creates a cultural dynamic, and then you get the creation around that phenomenon, that urban phenomenon, these band of white flight suburbs that act as a cordon sanitaire between these rural idol of the rest of like pre-industrialized like fully industrialized Wisconsin. uh and and the reality of urban industrial social order and so the cultures are different. the politics are different, and you see in Milwaaki, a real attempt by the local government in the form of the socialist administrations of the three, of three of the most influential governors, or I'm sorry, mayors of Milwaque, the key moments of of early, industrialization in Milwakee, the civic government was dominated by self-conscious socialist. people connected to the socialist movement and members of a socialist party that was grounded in class, like a real deal labor party, not like the democratic party, there's a there is a structural difference between these two things and that one, the democratic party is essentially in a client relationship with the bourgeois, like their existence is fully determined by the indulgence of and at the discretion, and it operates at the discretion. of the ruling class, yes, there is a grassroots support for the democratic party, and there is the party apparatus itself, the bureaucrats who make it up, but power is dispersed dramatically in one direction, there's at best an advisory role for the fucking populaus, the the socialist party exists because of the subscription of workers in the form of buying party newspapers, being paying dues to the party itself. volunteering for the party, those structures that are filled by uh mercenaries basically, like this is how hegemoneny works its way through a institution, if you want to understand that concept, this is a good comparison, the people who make up the actual party itself, the ones who make decisions within the structure of the Democratic party are essentially mercenaries, they might have a... political point of view, but the thing that is motivating in the government is advancement up the rungs of a capitalist system that they've invested in, because they're being drawn only by this position uh as as a social relationship, as a relationship to capitalism, as in not being fucking exploited by it, as in not having to actually work for a living, because it sucks to do so. "socialist party, the people who make up the party are doing it because it constitutes their identity, it constitutes their sense of self, their participation is self-building, it is not exchanging their time for money, which is what it is within a a uh boujois political party, that is a pure time for money thing." that time is being compensated for, not with money, but by the sense that one is collaborating in the building of a better fucking world, like they are, you are able to live within the constructs, within the these uh, the incentive structures that fill the party, that pull people from the grassroots into its uh organs like capillary action is commitment to principle, but that's only possible because there are jobs to be done, that there is money to be distributed, that there are positions within the hierarchy that can figure out how to direct all of that grassfoots desire for socialism into a coherent politics that can be effective, so there has to be a hierarchy in terms of responsibility and access to information and access to lovers of power, but that hierarchy cannot does not necessarily have to be governed by mercenary. uh capitalist self-interest that the point of the of the counterhegemonic struggle within capitalism by the working class is to build counter-hegemonic institutions that internally generate a type of relationship uh to politics and to one's with priorities that is fundamentally different from the uh mindset of the people who make up bourgeois parties, which means that they will actually respond to the uh incentive structure of the of the the political party and like the labor unions that are attached to it, the people expressing their will through those organs then have their will earnestly carried forth by the people in the party because there's no conflict, there is no... since there's no point at which there is a conflict between the self-interest of the bureaucrat of the party member of the politician and the uh the base. the mass, the the the working people, under bourjois party system and in bourjois politics that assumes capitalism, like the democratic party, bourgeois comfort of life, distance from alienation of labor, is a condition for the democrats participation in politics, they have to be... because they don't have any connection to anything greater, a socialist party would not understand uh their relationship to their self-interest that way, they are totally willing to shape what their b comfort is, what their relationship to actual work, actual alienation is, relative to uh, their sense that they're collaborating in an expression of their actual understood desire, their drive, the their purpose that they have generated for themselves through struggle. i'm not the one to talks about billions, i've never actually watched billions, although apparently i should, apparently it's very good. so you really did have to get back to Milwake, you really did have like a genuine socialist party in in embryo there able to assert municipal power, because there was this dense connection between the working class of Milwakee, the fact that a lot of them, that the massive number of them were german immigrants who all spoke German and had that like cultural uh connectivity that that like... uh ease of translation of concepts, that social lubricant of being like within a greater like anglo culture, they could you know define each other, and uh they were able to exercise municipal power, and so during the creation of the American industrial city at the turn of the century and after. are able to end the socialist city council where just as importantly if not more so we're able to direct public investment into uh uh civil interest into like a greater interest that is that uh transcended the profit imperative and it had an effect uh but as the work as that uh socialist party was broken and as the democratic party triumped and assimilated the working class movement into its structures during the new deal, by the time you get to the 50s and the real explosion of uh of uh industrialism in uh in Milwaque and like the creation of uh the modern of uh like wealth and and development that that has marked milwake ever since then, like they had a socialist mayor during that uh era Frank zidler and he was able to do some good stuff, i mean i think i honestly thank the socialists for the fact that the the vast majority of Milwakee's most pristine and beautiful waterfront uh is all still public park land turn into fucking condos or uh private yaught facilities or bullshit or some public private partnership, but when it came to the greater challenges of of integration for example, of of of how to take this group of people who are showing up last to the to the buffet uh of... the industrial boom in Milwakee, how are they integrated into the political structure, and if it is as workers, hey, you might actually be able to keep persist in pursuing uh socialist politics at the municipal level, but if it's as others, as as uh competition and threat, then bourjois uh political considerations will dominate every... voting patterns regardless of what they do, regardless of if they're workers or not, they will be voting along the interests of their, not as their... real class, but as their self-perceived class, and their self-perceived class is that of being uh the beneficiaries of capitalism, and they wish to persist in that role, and democratic politics shape was shaped around that resistance, and it's because of the failure to uh maintain a unified working class party uh political project that could compete for power at the crucial moment, which was... after World War II, and specifically after the death of Roosevelt, because Roosevelt was this massively expansive figure who was able to fit the entirety of the Democratic party and it's and the new deal state that it was creating, all of those contradictions could Corde sort of be subsumed into him because of his uh, his personal uh investment in the project, like at by the end of his life, FDR was the new deal state, in a real sense, represented it to Americans, and he had to have absorbed that sense, so his understanding of his project actually filled him with like a, I would say actually filled him with like a Paul atraids like quinsach Hadarak like uh mental uh vision uh or or of his power, because I do think that Roosevelt thought that he was saving capitalism from a crisis that would have... destroyed it with the goal, I do believe, the long-term goal of transcending capitalism, because capitalism, capitalists in the 30s, for the most part had a relationship to capitalism similar to the relationship that that slave owners in Virginia did in the early days of the Republic, like Jefferson and those guys, they absolutely. that slavery needed to persist in the here and now, but that it was a uh, and they would act politically to make sure that it was persisted, that it kept going, but they uh, they would have had a long-term vision that their actions would be leading to a future of emancipation, that's what they thought they were doing, now of course. that was a delusion, that was them trying to paper over the inherent contradictions in their way of life that they couldn't examine uh and so they discarded the idea uh as practical in the near term. now i would say that by guys like Roosevelt, maybe not all capitalist, maybe certainly not up and comeers, but people who had people from families who had been rich as long as Rosevelt, by the 30's had gotten to a point where... capitalism in its vulgarities and of and offenses to sense and uh and aesthetics and morality were such that they were embarrassed for capitalism's persistence and they hoped to move towards a future where it was extinguished and I would say that FDR was in that tradition now is that a foolheardy of him of course in the same way it was of the slave owners it's a delusion of a capitalist trying to uh fit his mental his self-interest into the historical moment in a way that gratifies him, a way for him to save a thing that he hates, capitalism, for self-interest, narrow self-interest and then create a narrative whereby he is doing a greater good, and he's doing it delusionally, but by 1945, I would argue that FDR's pursuit of peace with the Russians and relationships to the post colonial south, were the... vision of somebody who really wanted this thing to work, who really wanted to turn the new deal into a fundamental restructuring of what capitalism means towards it's eventual extermination. now he could not contain that contradiction forever, he was going to eventually have to come into significant conflict with either capitalism or his political project, but he never got the chance. because his goddamn head exploded, and maybe it exploded from the contradiction. I always, I want I wonder about guys like FDR and Lenin, where like the coming contradiction that they're not able to reconcile, that they know is coming, just makes their heads explode so that they can just check out of it and leave it to the next guy, and when he dies, you have this jump ball basically between the two existing political hegemonies that were... and that was the uh working class project symbolized at the level of executive power by Henry Wallis, is not a socialist, didn't come from the socialist project, came to politics from a moral position of Yankee puritan probity, but that position had put him on the top of a movement that was connected from in layers of dense layers of functional hierarchical control from the grassroots a multiracial, not, not obviously in the sense that we would want now, but but much more so than uh what the capitalist uh alternative wanted, uh, working class movement that expressed itself through the actions of political uh parties like the the democratic party, but also the communist party uh, and then also labor unions and their associate organizations, and then there's there's a fucking wedding cake stack of authority. delegation and democratic control that ends up in the person of Henry Wallis who believes in his project of advancing humanity by extinguishing capitalism peacefully with the same purity of belief simon pure naivete as FDR did in his vision, but a further elaboration of it, and 5:44 when FDR's health is failing, and the critical question comes, who is going to be: the likely next president, wallis, who had been FDR's third term VP, replacing the reactionary southerner, Cactus Jack Garner, but the party stalwarts were willing to put this dying man on the ticket to keep things smoothly going, insisted that Wallass not be on the ticket, they made it a a non-negotiable uh condition of their participation in his renomination. and he buckled and they put truman party hack on the ticket, meaning that in the in the key moment that came, the party apparatus itself, governed by these hacks by these bourgeois rentiers, basically political rentiers, we're going to impose their will, which put us in a terminal decline of capitalism towards suicidal extinguishment, the same way that the uh the uh explosion of the... economy in the south doomed their project, and in the same way, our our cultural uh rulers and our ruling class broadly understood, no longer is embarrassed about capitalism, no longer feels any of that uh early republican uh disdain for its savagery, we have now decided that the savagery is a virtue just like the old antibelum planters did, readers of South Carolina did, and as that southern political economy was destroyed from outside, so will, I think this uh political project. but of course, at a certain level, internal contradictions lead to external conflict at a sort of at a totally fixed symmetrical relationship, like they they they grow to meet one another, until failure in uh external - inability to uh resist an external con uh, an external challenge, off an internal uh reckoning, yeah, honestly, and this is why I am Gpilled, because I can be facil and imagine the uh, the battle between the north and the south in the civil war over over the over like the... the i guess the civic reality of capital extraction like what it would be to live under capitalism where like an ativistic and frankly barbarian uh logic of domination of like physical domination is extinguished by a more equally bloodless or i mean an equally cruel but more uh impersonal rule, but that the thing that makes that impersonal rule possible, the impersonal rule of the market is a baseline level of human dignity, like that human rights are inextricably linked to uh capitalism just because capitalism requires a degree of participation on the part of individual people that has to be undergirded by some sense that they're participating in a thing and not being compelled to do a thing, and now we are at an end state where American capitalism, which has always been the temporal spear point, like this is where the thing germinated, this is where the thing really where where the uh the tumor went into hyperdrive was uh was in America, so that means that we have not only did we create that fucking monstrosity of a uh of uh political economy in the south and of course a monstrous one in the north as well, one that's just one more way uh one more move removed from total like... domination and then you know it was defeated but it was assimilated into the politics because their ruling class was never excorporated, the ruling class that made up that uh that political economy was essentially assimilated into the broader ruling class of the emergent united states instead of being annihilated and and some synthetic sin uh culture, interracial culture emerging in the south, which had to happen, like that cast distinction had to be broken up, and there was an effort to do so, but another, another hingepoint of history where the wrong alliance of powers within a party, within a within a dominant structure of political authority in America win in a contest for power. and I would say that the reason that uh the contest for power beyond just the the coin flip stuff like Johnson being on the the the president after Lincoln, even without that you still have a massive problem there, you still have a huge uh contradiction that has to be resolved, but at that point Johnson represented the only coherent uh side, the the the radical republican side was built out of reaction to Johnson's policies and so it had to be built on the fly, and when it was being built, it was being built in in a moment when all possibility of land confiscation and redistribution was being taken off the table and the ruling elite of the south who had carried out the insurrection were being mass pardoned and insimilated back in the government and where the places where former slaves had been given land by the US militant. as a military uh exigency of war, we're having that land confiscated, and that was all on Johnson's prorogative directing this center of gravity within the greater republican project, the greater project of winning the war, the greater union at that point, national union as the republicans called themselves that year, project, and Johnson represented one coherent part of it, the other one was completely rift because it wasn't coherent. "it made up workers, it made up yowen, it made up merchants, it made up the professional uh class that supported the Republican Party and made up the officials within the republican party, but not around a central idea other than getting rid of slavery, but beyond that there was no agreement, and you had moralists like sumner, full liberals, had assimilated the idea that you know liberal free individuality was the siniquin of uh political liberty uh and personal liberty, didn't really care about any of the crucial questions of uh monetary policy for example and redistribution of land that would have made the uh reconstruction viable because he took for granted the free labor uh hard money nostrums of the the organized forces within capitalism that had carried out the war, but there was others, there were radical republicans who understood the implication of emancipation and the necessity to create a new political economy in the south that would have to break up the power of the old rulers of the old landed class and redistribute it downward to a multiracial yowen and and protoproletariat it in the south, would then relate to each other as workers instead of... along racial lines, and then carry out their relationship to capital as workers, of course, that was there, the ingredients for that were on the table in 65, not. over a short term, not within 20 years, but like I say, as a bending of the river to a point where maybe when the crisis comes again in 45, we have the same exact historical nexus and the same contours, but in a in a world where reconstruction was pursued more effectively by a coordinated, politically coherent section of explicitly anti-capitalist politics around the republican party that could have been embodied in a guy like Benjamin Butler and was embodied in the protoform in guys like Butler and Benjamin Wade and Thatius Stevens. Now this isn't to say that racism goes away in the south or that racial categories seas to be the the categories people view the their identities through. No, but worker instead of being subsumed becomes active. and the the the the burban elite who took over again after the civil war were well aware of this. Jim Croe, there's a there's a famous book on the subject, the strange uh, the strange life or the strange case of Jim Crow, I believe, that traces the uh, yes, seavan Woodward, the strange career of Jim Croe, and it chases... It's it uh, it uh, takes the arc of post war, post civil war politics in the south, uh, and char and is able to show pretty dramatically how the rise of uh Jim Cow, Crow, formal regimes of segregation, which were only imposed in the late 1800s, like all through reconstruction, there was no formal apartide, like there were interracial governments during this period, there were black governors and black uh members of the house and a black senator, but that went down all, there were black judges and there were black um sheriffs and mayors, real power, and wouldn't you know it that power was most concentrated in places where black land tenureship was strongest like in South Carolina, places where land tener was weakest, you had it the the the... the the uh failure even before the the the uh economic collapses of 1872 drew drove a stake in the heart of reconstruction, maybe that happens no matter what and reconstruction starts failing then, but if it starts failing with a certain momentum around political expressions of uh multi lake multiracial land redistribution uh and politics around it around the republican party connected to a national party that had its support in the middle classes and advanced progressive working classes of the north that could have allied itself as a new pole of politics, not one that wins, but the one that exerts pressure and becomes a foil for capital, instead of what we did get, which is that a capital assumes complete control of both political parties after the war, and then politics is entirely af. of regional and racial uh anxieties and uh repressed rage of southerners voted for democrats because they hated the north, they resented their defeat at their hands, they hated the uh the the serpent of of uh the serpent of freedom and class solidarity that had been unleashed and they wanted to defend uh their their position there, and in the north you voted for republicans because democrats had killed your dad, democrats are the reason that your cousins all died shitting themselves in a latrine uh in a fucking union camp before they even got to see battle, you vote the way you shot, that's what they said, vote how you shot. and that became the only basis everything else was subsumed because politics could not express the real felt alienation of of of workers and farmers as industrial America really got going and really started stripping them of their autonomy. and that is why as much as the you you have to, you have to affirm that the union was the progressive force during the civil war, they were doing necessary work, but they were doing necessary work. that at some point would be contested and had to be, because it was still a capitalist project, and there was no real working class at that point developed in America to to uh, actually express itself there, because free real estate had bought off time for class consciousness to emerge in America, free real estate and slavery kept class consciousness from developing until after our first great paroximum, our first great political crisis with... American capitalism, which was the civil war, and that's the root of American exceptionalism, which hilariously is a term that was coined by Stalin when he was making fun of American communist that because of free real estate, the United States was exempt from certain laws that marxist thought govern class dynamics and I'm sorry he was correct, America is exceptional. And the difference is is in the equation that dominated the emergence of capitalism in every European state, which were the first ones to get it, there is a fundamentally different uh equation, there is there is a factor that did not exist and that is frontier, but if you because the formula says at y amount of social pressure x degree of political consciousness emerges, well no, at y degree of political pressure, x amount of free real estate is is accessed, x amount of redistribution downward through uh imperial domination comes next, which means you don't get political formation until way down the line over here, down here is where you get it, and then it only goes so far before it's interdicted by a further expansion, now that is no longer the case, and a lot of our confusion about politics bums down to the fact that we're operating out of an extinct paradigm, the same way that those European communists were operating out of an extinct paradigm, even though they didn't know it, because America had already created a new formula that was more amable to capitalism and and stabilized it the way that a virus variant with will stabilize its relationship to the health of its host to prolong its ability to replicate itself. but the thing that built it, the structures that built it, the institutions of... deliberation, politics, culture, business, uh, transportation infrastructure, energy, uh, culture, anything you want to talk about, whatever, whatever, extrusions of politics, and culture you want to talk about, they were all forged under the assumptions that undergird that formula, where yes, there's wide degree of uh, of uh, of... exportporation and everyone agrees that that's fine, as long as we have that, we can operate under these conditions, but we no longer operate under those conditions, the formula has changed, because all those externalities that were priced out of every one of these fucking formula have now come back, the the externalities that are necessary for any of the equations to work, coming back, because profit is... is the accumulation of abstraction, it is taking real, it is making real something that is abstracted from a natural fixed environment, from a relationship of objects, the way that all other human activity is defined by, like we live within a matrix where our actions have consequences and we see we see them. and then we get the the uh immediate response or close enough for us to understand where it's coming from and then operate accordingly, we are conditioned and controlled away from doing damage, lasting damage, because we're actually connected to the uh cause and effect cycle. the development of technology allows us to function more efficient. and we create new realities that are abstracted away from these effects and it it is the it is the distance from them that allows us to create new technologies to intensify our uh our technological intervention with our environment in order to allow us to live more uh soothed lives, lives that are more comforted, the thing that we all feel, the desire to not hurt, but to to actually feel good, however we define that, and over and over time we define it entirely according to our ability to avoid unpleasant sensations and uh pursue pleasurable sensations. so we are now trapped on all of us sidonic treadmills, but the what makes it in to break out of that through logic and through intervention in media and trying to explain it and and come to a consensus is that all of us configure that feeling differently, we are all processing the pain, the misery that is coming back to us, both literally in the sense that people are having to flee wild fire. and and and you know people are having to move away from homes that are no longer uh stable, people are uh being dispossessed for multiple years by the destruction of infrastructure by uh storms, i mean climate change, which is this return of an exter of an externality that was priced out of politics and and of culture and of our understanding of the world by the magic of technology and by the promise of ease. because the democratic drive that defines politics in the era of mass population and and and industrial technology, not coincidentally is one of a demand for reliefs of from pain, and different answers for what that means a is out of class struggle and out of the creations of classes and and the recreation of cultural uh structures that reflect a new reality to certain people based on their conditions of exploitation and different answers come up and one of them eventually becomes a self-conscious working class socialist movement according to marx, one of many responses, the people who are exploited in x- way have y reaction, and in Europe they mostly did. In America, they did, but on a much more delayed scale, because of the intervention of land, and it was the problem of land dispensation that led to the civil war, because the imperative of expansion was so fundamental to the American project that even though it was raising political questions that the constitutional order was incapable of resolving and therefore leading towards a... fucking uh unnecessary from an economic point of view uh political civil war, neither side could put the breaks on it because it was so fundamental to everyone's project, making money out on the frontier, people are pissed, people want bread, give them a chance to make it on the frontier, and not just in terms of people who are going to move there, but people who can uh speculate in the stock of railroad companies, the Kansas Nebraska Act. which shattered the uh compromise of 1850 and really did bring the antibelum slave controversy to its end game was largely the product of Stephen Douglas who had a huge amount of money invested uh and stod to gain an incredible amount from the uh the success of uh railroad routes to to create the trans that ran through this territory that had not yet been brought into statehood which it would have to be in order to pursue this project and so the answer of well how about we just let him vote on it which is kicking it kicking the can down the road and so they said we'll do that we'll kick the can down the road and they did but you can only kick the can down the road so far because the formula is so dependent on expansion it cannot countenance any political challenge to it. the political challenge is dispute is is dispersed uh by some subsidiary question, in this case extension of slavery. now we're a similar stage for American capitalism as southern southern slave capitalism was, which is how the hell do we sustain a political economy when our growth matrix has been uh inhibited. and there's no answer, there's no internal answer, instead we get this culture war around questions of identity that is uh the product of 150 years of failure of the working class in America to cohere in the face of America's imperial project, which subsumed and neutralized its political uh power at every stage. so now we have this thing that has dominated a world economy, of course, you know, the relationship politically is different in other countries, but it doesn't really matter, because everyone is pegged to us, everyone is pegged to us, there are all their own relationships, they're all their own political and economic relationships to this capitalist world. system, but they're all in a relationship that is defined by our actions, and the the the the engine of the thing is in our spending economy, and in the the currency that is uh, supported by our world-spanning military, but there are things within that, like, so China gets capitalism way late, China gets capitalism, but basically at the very end of the line, capitalism starts on one and of eurasia kind of ricaches back a bit like if you imagine it is like a meteorite hits England in like the 17th century and it just sends shock waves across the globe and then capitalisms develop nationally in different areas over different times you get the echo coming out they're all getting capitalism in in Utero in some way as they're relating to this emerging world market and then eventually uh a crisis within it emerges that leads to some configuration of forces that carry out modernity, that's what it is, is that capitalism is the is the is the wheel pulling all of these carts, but the way that it is expressed culturally and politically is different in every place depending on the conditions of development that existed when capitalism had to start - there to compete with other states, and so the reason the Russians are the only place, are the only ones were able to carry out a communist overthrow of European capitalism, is because it was the least developed, it had the least developed institutions to resist, and so it was the working class communist party of Russia that had to carry out modernity, task that marks put on the hands of the bourgeois, put on the hands of capitalism, because it would be the changing of this condition, it would be the liberation of humans that would give communism its social validity and would make people work on a social basis, sacrifice personal ambition of comfort for a project, because they feel like they were part of something. It's actually that they had the most powerful ruling class, because the antibodies that resist uh, working class power are not to be found in the raw, in the in the exercise of like raw feudal land tenure, the way that the Romanovs did, it's by the institutions of the middle class. It's by it's by the relationship between uh urban cosmopolitanism, which is independent of capitalism, I would argue, I think one of the fundamental problems a lot of all rities and and post leftties have is that they they think that uh capitalism is somehow inextrably linked to urbanity and cosmopolitanism, that is incorrect, those things are older than capitalism, those things exist everywhere, the urbanity and and the the the uh expansion of horizons of uh of the dissolving of distinctions i would guess along uh like rigid categories of identity uh they correspond to being in a group of being in in in close quarters with other people, that is a relationship that then is interacts with capitalism in different ways depending on what sort of social structures have emerged when capitalism is imposed on them, and capitalism very much was imposed on Russia by the Romanovs in an effort to stave off what happened to the Chinese coming up at the very e when capitalism was forced on them at the barrel of foreign guns, capitalism comes for the Russians and the the Chinese at about the same time in the mid-19th century, the Russians abolish surf them, the Chinese go to war with England and get their asses kicked. and what that means was that when the crisis comes for China at the end of the Caboose, because we're going basically from the areas that are most dominated by massive longstanding imperial uh state structures that are not around internal competition and not subject to the imperatives of uh to to like efficientize in the in the face of like annihilation uh where they're dominated by a need to cooperate social against a uh horse-based nomadic culture that is like a direct competitor with your way of life, to the places where the pressures of uh of nomads are basically not existent because of insufficient grazing land and uh mountain ranges, but you have a small cluster of peninsulas uh and and naughty outcroppings and and islands that are all internally defensible and uh therefore undominatable from outside, so that's why capitalism emerges there, explodes there, and then is adopted internally or imposed externally, depending on how developed those uh, social technologies to translate, not, not the actual technologies, because the Chinese had all the technologies that made capitalism before, long before Europe did. is the uh political conditions that allow them to be uh utilized and those are generated by new property relations that emerge in England in the early modern period, like if you want to know why capitalism might destroy the earth, it might come down to the fact that that goddamn area between France and England that they call doggerland, then and that was like 100 thousand years ago was above ground and connected the British. uh mainland the british heart island, England to France, if that thing never, if that thing never filled in, maybe we don't get capitalism as the dominant uh, like programming for like all social interactions at the point when our ability to manipulate technology is almost superhuman. and god-like, I just imagine Napoleon with his 200,0 man army, I just listen to an episode of age of Napoleon about this that inspired me to think about it, 200,0 men standing on one end of a this thin little strip of water who, I have no doubt in my mind could have marched into England and subdued it, when you look at what Napoleon was able to do against the the Prussians. uh and the austrians and the it's he would have had no uh difficulty partially because although the English were the world's dominant um military empire at that point their army was pretty dog shit it was it was mids uh their dominance was was all naval based the their their navy was where they put all their eggs and and it was a good investment they maxed out uh art navy, but that left them lagging in army, and by that point, uh, English liberalism was not yet. creating any reason for regular people to believe in it, things were pretty miserable at that point in the pre-chartest days for the English like working class, the emergent working class who were just recently been dumped into cities out of the countryside after being denied, the ancient rights that had animated their family's connection to the land and and to the crown their entire fucking you know the entirety of their families existence in England, so the their military does not have the... of bonaparts, they don't have the genius of bonapart, he marches across that straight, he fucking dices and slices those motherfuckers, and of course it wouldn't even have gotten to that point by then, because there would have been no distinction, you know, it's just, it's just a way to say, at no point could England have escaped the wrath of the rest of Europe, the way that they were, once they unleashed capitalism on the rest of them, they beat them over the head with English uh liberalism and made them subdue and destroyed all of their cherished traditions and and ways of life uh because the immediate promise of capitalism imposed from without as it was by the English in most of the most of Europe uh is everybody loses out it gains nobody except for a small uh strand of merchants in the cities who are able to take advantage of their uh their proximity to the to the trade nexus and and be able to just sit on those axisses of trade basically. everybody else gets the shaft, surfs even surfs like oh you're liberated, congratulations, you get uh now if you don't sell your if you don't intensify your uh efficiency, if you don't basically exploit yourself, you're not going to be able to feed yourself, even though you live on the on your... own fucking property, even though you can grow your own food, you're not depending on, you now have to are compelled to sell in a market relationship, the artisans who had been like in the cities living in a urban cosmopolitan milieu for centuries at this point uh are are dispossessed of their uh their of the power that they had accumulated at they had in many of the cases been able to build guilds that acted as sort of bourgeois, proto bourgeois mechanisms of like class solidarity to uh effect to guarantee like their own conditions of work, and that was being dispossessed too, and even the fucking ruling classes, even the tenured landholders, the the the barrons and the margraves and the kings and queens, they were having to as a condition. with they've been doing it for 200 years from the decerists to 1905 or the the the fucking uh the decerists the uh what were they called the Nerodnics in the 1880s and then 1905 they were trying and trying to get together some sort of liberal opposition to z autocracy and they couldn't do it it wasn't happening. in marxist theory is alloyed out of working class movements in European capitalism because uh of their conditions of competition with other states which didn't exist in China, what they got in China was a revanchist domination, a century of humiliation as it was called, that informed all of liberal and then communist. responses to the decaying uh the decaying dynasty. and that is why the they were able to tack to the neoliberal center uh in the 70s because they were carrying out a self-consciously nationalist project. remember they talked about socialism, they talked about communism with Chinese characteristics and what that boiled down to is with a commitment to China as a nation, a commitment to China as a polity, not necessarily as just one, representative of an international working class, but as a politically particular unit, and so that gave by the 70s, you know, you have the great paroximums of the cultural revolution, as Mau and all those nervous students try to stave off capitalism, they can feel it coming, and they try to stave it off, but there there's insufficient uh capitalist technological development to facilitate it. you're sitting on top of a of a uh stagnant, a stagnated economic engine, something that got hooked into the capitalist world system in the 19th century and had barely built any kind of uh internal industrial economy and it done very little to and like the Soviets, once you do that, you have to have a mass expiation of guilt, so the despoilations of the the famins of collectivization in Russia lead to the great terror. and the purges, just as the great leap forward leaves to a mass internal uh cannibalistic frenzy, an attempt to to do something that was essentially impossible to have a communist movement carry out modernity, i said the say biggest cities in the world, cities is not capitalism. cities isn't capitalism, capitalism is what brings nationalism, you can't have one without the other, modern nationalism is a is capitalism's neurotic crisis of identity as it's uh, as capitalism. uh dominates private life, as it creates a private spear, and as it imposes violently upon people, as I said, this process in Europe is felt as a declention everywhere, it's felt as a downward turn, and that blame has to go somewhere, and the blame cannot be internal because that doesn't do the job of facilitating uh civic coersion, or uh, it doesn't do the job of facilitating civic. sent, so that's useless, it has to be an external enemy, it has to be another nation, it has to be another language, and so communism, when it comes to China, comes on top of nationalism, in a way that it doesn't necessarily do, in Europe where capitalism, nationalism had been developed before coherent working class institutions had emerged, there's an inoculation against nationalism. cities mean industry, but that industry does not necessarily capitalist. what makes a capitalist is when everyone engaged is engaging in a market relationship because they are compelled to, where they're following a logic that is not dictated by their. uh consensual assent to market relations, does it mean that that means that the the uh the communist part burns out in the cultural revolution? how could it not? I mean, I know people like to do epic mememes about oh, I want to do a... struggle session of Jeff Bezos or something, the reality of the cultural revolution was monstrously traumatic for everyone involved, you can argue about their green shoots and like the Shanghai Commune and like... there was good parts of it sure, but it was in every respect a nightmare, and it is one that extinguished really the communist project, but that left the nationalist project, and so China was able to essentially transition for being a communist state to being a cold war developmentalist state, but with the trappings of communism and the international orientation of communism. We've never had a communist state, I know that's feels like that seems like a copout, but we have not, we have had states within a global capitalist system ruled by bourjois ified party apparatuses that had greater or lesser devotions to an undergrding social project. and so the the thing about that is is that means that there's plenty of reason to support the soviets after the during the cold war, they're clearly the superior formation within this structure, but they're still within a capitalist mode of production that dominates, they have to extract surplus value from workers and they have to also uh alienate the workers from their autonomy over their lives, it has to have... and so now China has been able to do the developing part of capitalism with a Chinese state project, called communist, called nationalist, whatever it is, with certain assumptions undergiding that that mean that however they want to call it, you want to call it communism or nationalism. they believe in a project of people, they believe that institutions have to serve a social purpose, not all of them, but the uh the relationship between capitalist modernity and Chinese identity as such, that there are more there than there are anywhere else, certainly any here, there's none here, obviously. we're governed by just human uh reptiles like just hollow men, skeletons and they're just driving this thing into oblivion because they cannot recognize any human project, they can only recognize capital extraction. China still has human institutions that are able to carry out independent intervention in the market. Now what that means in the future in the conflict between the United States and the and and China to the degree that a conflict even exists and can exist considering how deeply intertwined they are, I don't know, I don't know what the shape is going to be, I'll I'll punt on that, I don't like, I no longer predict shit, I just try to read history now, because it's easier to get a right answer when you already know what happened. but I do think that if there's someone to root for here, my god, it's not uh, it's not difficult to understand, but the beauty part is you don't have to take any moral weight onto that question, because there's nothing you can do about it, there's nothing you or I can do to put any finger on the scale of this coming conflict, all we could do is just smuggly root from the sidelines, so that means it doesn't really matter and you can't blacks, you certainly don't need to devote yourself to finding out the truth about the weigers and then telling other people the truth about the weigers, either way, I mean yes, I would say, If somebody asked you, don't go along with all the China hysteria, that's for sure, don't start being like, yeah man, they're gonna come and uh, they're gonna connect your dick to a uh landline and and control you from a remote control, but I mean just look at the response to COVID, if you want an example of how... a social order can interact with uh crisis and of course the response there is uh oh but they're so authorit. tarian about it, if you like that, if you think that's better than what we have, well then you're uh, you're a bug person who wants to live in uh the matrix and be controlled by the chinese communist drone following you everywhere, and i just got to say look, i don't buy any premise that starts that we're freeer people than the Chinese are. Look at what we go through, look at what we put up with, and the thing that, and this is what matters to me is that you can point to real authoritarian, authoritarianism in China, but the United States almost always mirrors that authoritarianism, but that authoritarianism is hidden behind the mystical, mysterious veil of the market, it has been abstracted out of political violence, but it is political. It is political choice carried out by an oligarch of control that is human and origin and that can be intervened with, but we have naturalized it because of a lack of any other cultural vocabulary, any other project to orient ourselves around, and if you're gonna have that, if we're all going to live in a in a situation where... the market, some combination of technology and uh, an algorithm, I mean this is what we're talking about, we're talking about real technology like the social credit machines and the CCTV cameras and the great firewall of China that the Chinese have, or just the regime of daily economic compulsion that gets us and debt, forget any of the rest of that. forget got to pay your bills debt, debt is all of the all of chairman she's regime of thugs turned into an abstract concept detached from politics, but that still dominates your life, it is even more of a dictatorship because it is not even agreed to be political. like we complain about social credit, what the fuck do you think your credit score is? that is your social credit score, it determines what you can do. so yeah, for the only the only the only point of intervention in this spiraling. fest towards some sort of confrontation over China or some retreat into a a dim bulbed camp sort of uh cargo cult around China as our savior which is no good either is to just use the conflict as a way to get in as a wedge, a recognition of all of the transparent authoritarianism the... we live and breathing, and that is why our coronavirus response has been so bad, because the market is the tyrant, that means it cannot serve social needs, the market is unconcerned with social, the market is market is in visiral conflict, it's essentially the anti-mather to the social, so it can only make off of the thing, it can only extract value, it can only, it can only make a buck, so people are forced to, you have to pay $100 to get a take home covid test, you think you'd want those things just given away for free, and and of course what this means is that the one thing that would emerge in any social structure, like if we had world communism and coronavirus happened, of course you might say, oh the coronavirus wouldn't happen with the communism, probably not, but let's say just bad luck and something happens and we get a fucking uh coronavirus in a in a communist system, people would come together, fund a vaccine and distribute it, that would happen in any structure, it is a response to the thing, capitalism is doing it, because their system runs on a a a a consumer economy that is being genuinely hindered by the continuation of this thing and it's pressure on. huge privatization of wealth scheme where public research gets privat for profit, which is how capitalism works, but every incentive still aligns to make a vaccine that is effective. and then once it's available, how is it distributed? well, if it's if it works, if it's doing what both capitalists and communist would want it to do, then rich people are going to want it, and they're going to want to get Americans it very quickly. everybody else can kind of wait, and people in the global south who don't really spend a lot of money, they can wait a long goddamn time. in fact, we might not want them to ever get it, because hey, maybe this solves some of the problems we're having. with arithmetic on our global uh political structure, so everything tells you looking at it, okay, this thing basically does what they say it does, rushed, yeah, probably going to have uh unintended side effects that are going to be bad for you, definitely. I had to charge my sorry, the phone was, the stupid mac lap wasn't plugged in, sorry, I'm just on a roll here, I don't want to stop quite yet, even though I've gone long already, but yet you have this huge resistance to take the vaccine, and here is the thing, it is all warranted, there is no reason to trust these institutions, they're bad, they do bad things, they want bad things for you. but the thing that drives the political response to it, the thing that becomes the most coherent expression of this resistance to vaccines ends up being dominated not by a critique of the institutions other than as like a partisan thing, but as a expression of an individual autonomy and uh transcendence of like social obligations. that is literally anti-social, like it is a denial of the existence of the social and of social obligation as a concept. now of course, as I said, plenty of people don't think that way, they they want, because they think it's a scam, they think it's wrong, but they accede to so much, this is what I'm saying, we seed to capitalism's absolute mandate every day of our lives, it sucks us down, it drags us down, but there's nothing we really feel that we can do about it. what we can do about it is express that alienation somewhere else, we can transfer that feeling to something else. and we can assert authority and power over our lives somewhere else. and there is this vaccine that they tell you to take, and you cannot take it as a way to express autonomy. here's me being an agent of history and not just another passive reciprocant, but there's plenty of things you could do that with, the reason people are choosing vaccine is because that is one that has a broader cultural violence, because nobody wants to be, nobody wants to suffer, nobody wants to do something different, nobody wants to risk the punishment of defying the world alone, that's why we keep doing what they tell us to do every day cuz we don't want the punishment, the only way we uh participate in resistance is if we feel like someone's going to have our back and we're not going to be punished for it, and that is what allows us to express ourselves that way, and anti-vax sentiment can get that response, because not because people are expressing their alienation of capitalism, at least not in a way that is directed towards an a a healthy relationship to our institutions, but you are hearing from petty bourgeois, would be barons who are met much less trans uh and much less abstract than it used to be. there is an entire political current that is gearing up to turn that into a virtue to say yes, like our participation in this massacre, the sanguinary carnival is a act of virtue, and that requires denying a social, denying a moral obligation to a social, denying the existence of a social, and so everybody ends up getting caught in this. anti-social political vortex, because that's where the because that is the only politically articulate version of that resistance you're going to find is within the republican party and on the right, because no other current exists, everybody, everybody else is just drafting off of the the left liberal hegemony of the democrats, Bernie was the alternative to try to turn into a a question of institutions, but he got, he got rinsed, because the people who vote are the last land owners, they're the last barons and so the ones who deny a social are the ones who dominate the republican party. now of course, the social that the liberals believe in is a cramped liberal fantasy that is not up to the contradictions of capitalism, but they can sustain it. in their suburban bubbles the same way that the delusional uh no society mega people can, and so the only thing that they can react to is not the compulsion of the market, but when the market is absent, when the hand of the market is not there to obscure, so the fact that the fucking thing itself is free, it is a government intervention, it is saying here we're going to give this to you, fundamentally disqualifies it, it renders it an imposition of an alien and foreign body, because the way that the reactionary American landdhower reconciles their participation in capitalism with all the things they hate about living and that are imposed on them, they abstract that onto the state, the state representing an other. that is attempting to dominate their individuality and autonomy, so the the the market can make them do anything and it's fine, because it is nature, it's God's will, basically, but when the state does something, that is an expression of the will of this inherently malevel another, and so they resent, they resist it, and so they're going to when Biden got in, at the timing he got... and it made it impossible to have any other dynamic around it, and so then getting the vaccine becomes politicized, and that means anybody who is anxious for good reason about America's uh, pharmaceutical infrastructure, it's governing institutions is absorbed in a greater umbrella of this, anti-social reactinary posture, they can only draft off of it. and that's why it's very funny to see people who in the last year or so did a very lot did a uh made a made a spectacle of themselves sort of walking away from the left by deciding that the left is no good because it's basically just captive to the democrats and therefore all leftism is tainted by neoliberalism and can only uh fight a culture war that reinforces class divisions and therefore decided that the republican party and their populist tradition would be would act differently, would be able to be suborned to a class project, so in the moment of this monstrous failure of a response to COVID, with people being thrown out on the streets, with people being forced to work shitty jobs and cut off from unemployment with people being having their lives at risk because they can't get to a fucking hospital or they can't the... afraid of what they're going to it's going to cost them to get the fucking vaccine, well a lot of people don't even believe it's free uh or or what what's going to happen if they get sick as a result of taking it, all of that real angst and anxiety, how is it expressed uh politically as a question of whether or not you should be able to eat horsey wormer and then becoming a exponent of a culture war of resentment that says: the liberal elites are are condemning my my precious folkway of eating this medicine, all of a sudden these people trying to walk away from the culture war by disengaging from the democrats, what's this? oh, I'm on the exact same, just, I am on the other side of the exact same steril stupid argument that cannot result in class politics. what, what is the class project that comes out of telling people, yeah, don't care what the doctor tells you, go on facebook, as an alternative to a vaccine, as I said, that should be rational. understood to be the right thing to do, so you have to deny that, the the the reality of the vaccine effectiveness, you have to deny that, and instead assume that the vain, neurotic, childish, bourgeois, self-identity of these precious fat boys in the suburbs who don't want to be. what to do, that you are hostage to that perspective, and of course that means I'm going to outsmart the CDC, and I'm going to take this instead, and I'm going to own you by doing it, because the vaccine exists, going out of your way to take the paste is a political act, and it is motivated by a childlish oppositional defiance, and then you have to defend that all day, and wrap yourself into a a pretzel to figure out a way that actually this is just more proof of the uh the sicco dictatorship of the libs and not recognize that oh this is only a thing we're talking about because these guys are doing this why are they doing it? they're not doing it because they did their independent research they're doing it because they saw a fucking facebook post. it is a political act. of self-identity just like all the people posting black lives matter last summer were that pissed off all these people and said we can't talk about class because we got to keep talking about race. good luck talking about fucking class when all they want to do is be told that actually there is no such thing as class, there is no such thing as human beings, there's only me and my desires and then everything else is just a formless gray shape that i have to fend off in any way necessary. I mean at a certain level you have to recognize, oh I am writing this for uh the indulgence of a just the same sort of spectating hooting swine, the disengaged uh spectators who are watching this country get grounded into fucking bone meal, who are getting off on watch. I'm just serving out more slop for them, and then you have to ask yourself, is this what I wanted to do, and if your answer is, oh yeah, no, I just wanted, I just think I'm going to get, I just want to either get a job out of it, get some self-esteem, or just, I don't like sports ball, so this is just as good. and that is where the real nialism resides, that's where the and and that is selected for, everybody in all of left media, right media, media period, they're selected for mercenaries, that's why everyone is so terrified of being a grifter or of being grifted, it's because we recognize what the incentives are of this structure. and i myself do whatever like penance i can for my participation in this by trying actively not to contribute to the reactive narrative and to provide some sort of orthogonal metarrative and that is of course self-serving but who else is it going to serve? we're all only as compelled by others as we're made to be, and I'm building my connections, but you know, work in progress. and yeah, the real way to exercise all those demons is to help others, it's very uh banale and uh also vague because help is a very wide term, but yeah, I think is potter Steven, potter Stewart said it, helping, you know when you feel it, if not see it, all right, I'm off to take my horse face for the day, chao.
