 in the shuffling madness, the locomotive breath, let the all time loser, head long to his death. unhost, i already did that, unhost, what is going on? Yeah, okay, I got cancel. you feel the piston scraping go scraping off his brow thank god he so the handles buse the train won't stop going though it could slow down yeah yeah you hear the silence jumping, angels as they fall, the woman and his best friend in bed and having fun, always calling down the corridor on his hands and knees, so charliely he stole the handle, and the trainer won't stop going, though it could slow down. now yeah, yeah, flute solo, you know how it goes, you know, you know just road tol, you know toll, you know about the flute solo, you know how it goes, you can sing it yourself, do I sound okay? does does it sound all right? had problems yesterday apparently, it was a little tinny, i don't know what that is, something with the internet, someone asked, this is actually a very good question to start with, somebody asked if i have trot brain, am i a trot at the heart of it, and you know what, having certainly after having read deutcher's uh biography of trotsky. uh, I absolutely feel like at a certain level I have to take the claim, because I really do feel like Trotssky is the lens that everyone looks back at history with, which is not in a position of action, but in a position of observation, and that is why he refused to ever really. It's that he is always seeking the transcendence of the conflict, he's always seeking the third poll that should... historically be doing the work of resolving these problems, that is why he took the riddle of how to be a convinced marxist in Russia, which was a fucking feudal backwater being integrated into capitalism is an essential a medieval country having capitalism thrust on it, you still have to like, if you are a marxist and you believe, and marxism is the... belief that replaced christianity at like within the the the liberal cosmology that followed, the death of God as well it had to, something has to fill that gap, and marxism was good, but how do you live by its tenents, it's guiding principles in a situation where you do not have a revolutionary role to play, you only know about this: stuff because of what happened in Europe, the development you seek has to come through capitalism, not through a revolution from above, which it would have to be because of the unorganized nature of the peasant masses, the majority, communism is about building a a a self-conscious into a majority through conflict with capitalism, not through conflict with the communist directed industrial economy, and none of them, none of those bolscheviks would have gone through with 1917 if they thought they would have had to have done that, they were assuming because they were all listening to trotski, some uh intervention in the form of a a European led global revolution that would start in. and there was a period there in 1918 specifically when those motherfuckers thought they were right, they thought it was all coming together, they were just even though the whole country was falling apart and they were in the middle of a civil war and they were doing brutal violence, they felt like oh my god this shit's coming together because of the the German revolution of 1918 and the like the strikes in in in uh german cities throughout 1919, but the tide rolled back and then when Russia was defeated on the field of battle in the in the Soviet Polish war, which hilariously you could blame on Stalin and people have blamed on Stalin for not driving his forces directly towards Warsaw, uh, when that tide rol back, new conditions observed, and people had to decide, okay, what are we, what are we more committed to? the marxist project, the socialist project, or my place in it? what are we more protective of? and that was the conflict that defined the question of how to deal with the peasantry, because in my mind, buukarin had the right of it. the bourjois could not defend itself in 1917, it would have been overwhelmed by counter revolution from the reactionary. feudal overlords would have happened, they were not there, the only part of the of the uh political structure of of the class structure in the cities uh was and St. Petersburg specifically was the fucking uh the bulshevic party. and so of course the people who ended up winning that question about what to do with the peasants were those who said collectivize at the point of a gun because that was the way to save their position within this new uh new world they made and their conviction that they were right, they were historically vindicated, which is the thing they cared about more than anything. and Trotski was paralyzed by the question, he wanted industrialization, but he did not want what it would have required, and so he sought the revolution, he was perpetually seeking the third thing that would, and according to marxism, should eventually emerge, the fucking global revolution, which is like supposed to be on its way, and so... that puts them in a position, the trot at heart of being horrified uh by the prospect of uh actually holding power. because they can only imagine holding power as uh moral uh like personal moral uh uh decrepitude personal uh um violation. and so like the the tratskiust is the person who flees from power because they don't want the responsibilities it entails, because they don't have their conviction is of something that is not in the moment, they're not convinced, they're not convinced, but how could you ever be convinced? and so you will always flee from power, that's why you got a split at every five minutes. because you have to flee from power and it's responsibilities, even the responsibility of supporting other countries that oppose the United States in some abstract sense that doesn't even matter in your day-to-day life because you're in the imperial core and who the fuck cares what you have to say about another country, well how is this the most important thing in the world that you have weighed the heart of this foreign part foreign uh government against the... and found it wanting, like there's a context, but the the idea of of appealing to uh the other to rise up instead of asserting power is, I say, I would say the the default state of leftists in the west since the fall of the Soviet Union, essentially everybody's a trotskist once the Soviet Union ends and the people who... like cling crazily to supporting the Soviet Union in the history or current communist regimes no matter what they do like China uh they're doing that because they have uh they're trying to deny their essential Tratskiism, they're trying to deny their uh phobia of power because of the futility. of it, and so you can hold off and hold a position where the only political formation you can really support is one made up of people of perfectly like mind, because that's all it is, it's mind, there is no material interest binding any of these people any of us, we are not members of a class of of of a labor class and... and so everybody's a trot everybody is either embracing it and going ham sectarian style and denouncing every other every non-american regime that does anything that they wouldn't do in a plot. ideal of a fucking socialist system that has that could not exist in the current moment because of the persistence of capitalism? and so even as we come together, in what we think is an imitation of mass politics on the left, we're really just a bunch of trots bringing together our splinter groups until they start fracturing again. and that will persist until there is a genuinely um materially fixed working uh socialist movement in this country forget working class like i said that's a meaningful phrase now just people organizing not on not in political parties not in interest groups not in uh a third like um pressure groups but as workers. and building connections to other people that are like politically infused but socially dense that are forged by neutral experience and that define our action out of the clouds and into reality where a lot of the seat of the questions that seem paralyzing from the heights are clarified because a lot of them don't even fucking come up because We're all arguing about things that are theoretical, we're arguing about conditions of what would who would i let in my movement? there is no movement, you are asking these questions to have these questions to ask, you are fleeing from power, the very prospect of it, which begins with submission, which begins with submission of time and energy, submitting to others will, and and the decision of what to do with your time when you're not being compensated for it, when compensation is the soul mode of drive that we have built into our uh, our um, our social feedback, like what we not? the only way we uh the market defines all uh in all actions that we then like associate with being productive like if we're not being paid for it it doesn't feel like real uh we don't feel true motivated to do it that is the libertarian thesis and it is what they try to turn us into and we're pushing against that we're swimming against upstream at every moment trying to pull together in the face of that because the work that needs to be done is not going to be renewed. or remunerated, however the fuck you say that word, it is not going to be compensated for in the only currency that matters currency, because everyone's trying to keep their fucking head above water, very few of us think of us ourselves as having time to spend not keeping a roof over our head when things are so goddamn scary and precarity is all you feel. so it's a lot to ask people to do work that's not going to be immediately pleasurable or compensated for, what's going to make them do that is not an idea, it is not a theory, it is not a side, it is a shared interest with others that can then take that fire hose of of selfishness. and fear and direct it, oh, I don't have to just be anxious about this, oh, I don't have to just be angry, because other people who know what I'm going through, who are not, who are not uh, who are not condescending to us from a cultural uh, height, which is very much what the online left is, by definition, this is true of all cultural expressions, like, it doesn't mean that there isn't it isn't necessary, it doesn't mean that ideas that end up by percalating into grassroots work don't start there or aren't rather I should say communicated there, but there is a barrier there, especially since a lot of the things that these people talk about, me included, are not relevant to people's direct uh strategic and tactical questions, those strategic and tactical questions uh, are only answerable at at the point of experience. We are all uniquely alienated. We do not have a shared language of alienation. That is perfect, and the word language is the most important. part there, because when we say we experience, we all get, we are all mutually alienated by capitalism, but we experience that alienation differently, it means we have different words to describe that feeling that we used to for ourselves and among ourselves, and that means that we build and forge definitions of terms in our intimate relationships, now the now the terms we're talking about are are brought down from a cultural firmament. all the expressions and and language of culture and politics that we share, we are having imposed on us, not from around ours, from those around us, but from this this cultural superstructure, but the definitions of those words, the inflections, the the unspoken shared emotional connotations of the words are forged uh personally, are forged not. on the internet, and we all still have some social life, and even if it's more impovered than it used to, that's still where we get our definitions, and so the sterility of of post-working class politics or post-class politics at all in America, is that when we feel this alienation, we have this huge gap between what these words are used as currency in the culture and what we what we think the words mean and that means that when we're picking and choosing the words to describe our exploitation and misery we are uh not reproducing a relationship uh between like our material conditions uh and uh what we blame for it, but we're picking from this gumbo, this cosmic gumbo of you will of ideas that are coming from above and that don't relate to my direct experience, because there is no working class counter hegemonie to express cultural ideas, this is what this is essentially. his entire conception of how this works is that you you do not get a a uh working class that can viy for power with capital through uh just organizing uh at the base, what happens is is that through organizing on the base you create cultural institutions that do not answer to capital that are generated from uh the collective will, the decisions of these people that are made outside of considerations. profit and compensation, they're doing this shit as it were for free, and it's the degree to which they will do things for free that gives them the power to act as a social organism against capitalism. i could draw this as a graph, i swear to god, and the and that used to be in this country, there was a working class that had a... this this thing that connected grassroots people working in factories with union organizations that then confederated and then had relationships to a political party that was infested at every level and and staffed at every level with people moving through this with capillary motion through this machine and then getting into positions of authority within cultural creators and and and policies that were directly uh associated with now the thing that a lot of people miss about this arrangement is is that you don't get to a point, i don't think anyway where capitalism is essentially culturally overwhelmed in this way, the way that the revisionists would imagine, the point of this, the point of creating this structure or the point rather, i should say this the... purpose this structure serves in generating revolutionary potential is that you have people who are self-aware as workers and there are more of them over time and they make up a bigger percentage of the of the unorganized masses so that when a crisis of capitalism comes that cannot be negotiated that can no longer be negotiated you are now negotiating terms of surrender they will go to they will go to war, they will not sign terms of surrender without seeing how it goes on the battlefield, we've seen that time and again, there is a limit to the reform that any system can take, and then either uh, two things in historically have happened, either the ground collapses under the feet of the ruling class before they can declare. war like in the French Revolution, or uh, they declare war and usually honestly win, because the working class isn't ready, and I would argue that there were several points that called for the uh, that strategically called for the working class to be ready to go to war. and I would say that obviously the big one was 1914, but the the the work of creating a transnational working class had not, it did not happened, it needed longer, it needed longer, who knows, under stable conditions uh, how how long it would have taken for uh, solidarity in Europe among internet uh working class parties across national lines to. overcome nationalism, i think it would have happened eventually, but world war 1 happened and they weren't strong enough to stop it or risk their position. and so and then of course after world war 1 and the Russian revolution you have another moment of conflict after World War II is a huge moment when Stalin back down and you can say that he had to, but again he had to do it to save the Soviet Union, but that's not, the Soviet Union is a vessel, the Soviet Union is a fucking vessel, we're all vessels for this thing. we're not supposed to fucking uh care about our immediate uh power maintenance of power, but you could argue that the the the conditions meant we would have lost, and so we we stood down, and that that fight by the way extended to the United States where there was a huge explosion of strikes immediately after World War II, uh, the biggest strike wave in American history. at that point uh and this was in conditions of you know relative prosperity following the the great depression, but all labor conflict had been muzzled during the war uh and there had been the popular front with the Soviets and so a lot of the most militant workers in America were convinced that they were getting ready for a push after the Soviet Nazis were defeated to confront capitalism in alliance with the Soviet Union either over. or uh you know as sort of a situation where the United States and and uh the Soviet Union agreee to a sort of leveraged buyout of each other after World War II and that they could coordinate that from below through their mobilization within labor unions uh these are the CIO communists and such and there was a huge huge uh strike wave. part of the strike wave involved Harry Trumanan nationalalizing or trying to nationalize the steel industry until the Supreme Court told him no, but of course unlike Jackson uh he obeyed that time and that wave broke and with it came a counterreaction from capital in the form of Meccathiism and the red scare which was used to root out the real motivated, people who will do shit for free, core of the labor movement and replacing it with people who were going to do way less for free, and with that taft heartly, which is a stake in the heart of the labor movement, absent, just as a as a self-preserving bureaucracy and and and mechanism for patronage distribution, shorne of ideology, just as part of like the the organ system of capitalism, it also killed that too, the red scare and taft heartly killed the body and soul of the American labor movement, of course nobody knew it at the time, they thought okay, we'll get them next time, but next time was the 70s, and at that point the the working class had been so thoroughly uh castrated of any kind of ideology or um political vitality. that when it came time to restructure uh the the deal essentially between uh workers and capital that have been struck after World War II, there were no actual working class interests at the table, there were only bureaucrats, there were only bureaucrats of structures who were totally adhered to the state and had loyalty to the state, not to the working class. and we've been living in the aftermath of that ever since, and what that means is that there is no, there is no counterhegemony, there is no left-wing counterhegemony, there is a leftest strain within culture, but as part of the broader liberal capitalist realist millieu, a new left must be built through struggle. I think that's the first principle, that's the first principle I operate from, and people wonder, how the hell can get people get mad at the government and feel alienated from the government because they have to pay taxes and they feel like that's a pressure. or the government tells them that they have to wear a seat belt or or uh they have to wear a mask, that's oppression, but their boss can tell them, you know, how much time off they can have, when they can take a... kiss, uh, what they can eat for lunch, whatever the hell, uh, they can determine the the the vast majority of their life, and they don't see them as their enemy, and it's because they're the ones who pay them, and in a culture that is purely and fully from the point of view of capital, that is, that is constructed from the malaki and eye of capital, at least the head, the stuff that we all react to the same way the parties concentrate this, and then we all react to it, and and and revolve around it, but the main the big stuff that everybody sees, not the little stuff that micro sects see, is hegemonically liberal, there's no counterculture, countercurrent within it, and so we can only operate as as self-interested units, and that means that even though we're all experiencing capitalist exploitation and alienation more keeny every day, because the most direct expression of that is. for with money, we are paid for it, it doesn't feel that bad, and consequently we vent our alienation at all everything, except the cause of it, because the cause of it has been compensated for, and if it's not enough money, that's really your fault, for not hustling hard enough, for not having gotten the right degree, for not standing up to your boss and asking for a raise. It's your fault, you're not having enough money, they're there is like a god-like dispenser of value because value is determined in the market, value is determined in the market and we absorb that, and then we operate from those assumptions, and that colors our entire approach to politics, our entire conception of ourself. as citizens, as political subjects and it means the class is washed away, class is not perceptible in our expression, our language can't pick it up, there is an article uh in harpers about the besomer alabama amazon uh warehouse um union drive. and they follow this young guy uh worked who worked as Amazon uh he's a young African-American guy uh he worked there and he was a self-described like uh entrepreneur like he thought of working at Amazon as a stepping stone and he thought that uh you he was gonna end up selling to Amazon he was gonna have his own cosmetics company and then he was going to be a partner of Amazon, he identified with Amazon and if he didn't make money he felt ashamed, if he if his thing wasn't gonna succeed he would have felt ashamed, he would have because it's god and so he didn't want a union because the amazon amazon told him and the only people in the neighbor and the majority of people in the plant in the factory that wanted or the... uh fulfillment center that wanted a union where the old people who remember when Union's union jobs existed uh in the steel industry there before it went away, their kids don't have those memories, they don't have that experience of sharing grievances against the person giving you money, the person giving you money is their entire life been the dispenser of value in every element of society. in your fucking soul, and now that doesn't mean we're all doomed to it, but it's what you have to fight against, and you have to assume that we're in a condition of prostrate institutions, and since crisis is accelerating, I would say the crisis is accelerating pretty rapidly, even if it doesn't always feel that way, uh, that the... the dispenser basically is going to disrupt our expectations enough to bring us sort of out of the trance, bring us more into the moment of our lives, bring us more urgently into connection with each other over these crisis conditions, what do we do? what do we do? at the end of the day you can only ask the computer what do we do so much because they don't know because they're asked. you ask yourself or you ask each other and you act, and again, this is not to blame anyone, like one of the big things that makes it so hard to communicate, because of this is the emotional content of these terms, and in the absence of material interests, all politics as we experience it through media, or otherwise is moral, it's all moralizing, it's all moralizing, it can only be a moral question, because there is no material dimension, as I said, that is all getting steamed off through self-loathing in the market. and so if questions are moral questions only, then holding positions is of um, holding positions on anything is a moral act, having opinions becomes the only moral act because it's the only public one. the only one that we enact, and so that means that these questions become totally colored and our ability to answer them throws goes out the window because we're fucking defending our very self-conception as virtuous people, which is all we have, and the thing about marxism, and this is forgotten because we just can't process it is that Marx was a moral deflationist, unlike all the other socialist leaders who were emerging and thinkers. were starting to to right oppose to capitalism in the mid-19th century. Marx did not object to capitalism on moral grounds. This is very important to understand. Marks was not saying that that the exploitation of capitalism was evil, and the capitalists were evil because they did it, which is different than all the other, utopian socialists and Christian socialists and anarchist of the... period to find it, to him, capitalist were acting out their historic role in disrupting the feudal order and creating the conditions for self-aware working class to emerge, which would then act in their collective self-interest, which would abolish bourgeois morality and would have abolished all of the petty questions of of good and bad that consume us and consume our and make us neurotic with... about our ourselves, oh, is it moral to steal a loaf of bread to feed your family? well, nobody's needs defeed, nobodys everybody gets bread, everybody gets bread, you don't have to worry about it, all these, all these questions become meaningless, these questions that we fixate over, if we can push through, and so marx was more, marx was morally deflationary, he wanted people to think of politics less about morality, he was is in opposed to rouse. you wanted it to be thought of not that way so that you could view every situation dispassionately so that could you could view the contours before you with a clear fucking eye and because we live in a post working post-class culture, we live in a post-class society in a real meaningful sense, not that there isn't class exploitation. but that it is no longer processed as such and therefore like the culture does not have within it the strands, the the the expression of a working class culture, that's gone, and with it is anything other than a moral basis for politics, so all of us, even marxists, even people believe in their bones, that that that everything marks said about about the dialectic of history and materialism. uh is true, they still argue, even if they don't know it, on moral grounds, and invest these questions with moral import, and like if you want to understand the culture war as it is, and the liberal ratchet towards a a more and more strident, multicultural. the shit that the post left always talks about as though it's a conspiracy between rethion and bank of America, it is not, it is the... subconscious, collective spasm of conscience of the urban liberal class, these are people who are in a system where they benefit from exploitation and misery, where they get to lives of unaalientation, unaalienated labor that is alienated by their guilt, that is motivated by their fucking guilt, and that guilt must be expigated somehow. and that is where the the the moral uh grandstanding and and uh bidding up come from and moral inflation and that means that more and more liberals as as conditions get worse uh as as anxiety and politization of of culture become more and and the urge to change something becomes more felt by people even if they can't articulate why? they have to express it, and and if you feel even if you are not even if you are being exploited, even if you are a working a worker, even if you are precarious, you still feel guilty, because you have conditioned yourself to view the world through a lens whereby the world, things aren't fair and it's capitalism's fault, but you're still benefiting from it in your mind, because of the cultural uh, because of your cultural expectation. It's not about any actual class position, it's your cultural expectations, and it is people almost, it is almost exclusively people who are feel guilty, are making the decisions about where the... contours of the culture war should go, both uh what politicians should say, opinion makers online and social media, uh, people in trying to make a a job out of it like fucking Robin Diangelo and and another fucking racial uh water diviners, these fucking racial uh rainmakers, and then even at the very top you've got very guilty liberal billionaires, because this is this this thing is absorbed everybody. declassed everybody, including the rich, the rich are being declassed, the rich are being lumpinized, but of course capitalism doesn't need them to uh be class oriented to orient to for capitalism to work to their benefit, because it is a machine of extracting profit and pushing it upward, and even if the people who it's been given to are horrified by the machine and would like to stop it, they can't, and so they figure out explanations in their head for why they should still have all that. even though it's being wrought by this horror, and the answer liberals come to is, well, it's the racism, it's the racism, it's it's white maleness, we got to defeat that, which is of course most like the it's a white male paradigm, they're just trying to extract that part of themselves that feels guilty and then exprigate that guilt throughtic destruction of the other. and then on the right, conservatives think, oh, it's uh, it's the blacks fault, it's uh, it's non-hierarchy's fault, basically, because black people form in the United States this other, this racial other that is not fully within citizenship, and that is the the escape valve for class conflict within the the American polity, it always has been, that's why fundamentally northern capitalism could not acced. to the end of the racial cast system in the south after the civil war, it couldn't do it, because it would have destabilized the the uneasy dayton that was currently existing between workers, smallholders and capital, it might have tipped things in the direction of class war, class conflict cuz my god what if the poor whites and the poor blacks get together after the civil war, what if they what if they uh compare nose, they will be an un beatable position, they they will have leverage that will be undefeitable by by the the the shabby trappings of post war American capitalism that had not yet turned into the mighty dynamo that would conquer the world, and so that racial cast system is at the basis of American capitalism, not as the founder, the foundation, which is what... and I think that really is where a lot of confusion comes from, is once again, this is moralism, creeping into objective questions, it morally feels right to think, because you get to talk about it in these terms. that are amenable to the discourse and amenable to politics, which is racial, we can monkey around with that stuff, we can't do anything about capitalism, we can monkey around with the order of of hierarchy and who gets to get in and gets to go out, we can diversify our ruling class, we have that option, but we have to not be uh, you know, more, we have to be morally committed to that, now. gets built in, it gets, it gets deeper than any other experience, so for a lot of right wingers, yeah, throughout history, they have been motivated in their mind by racism, even though that racism is built on top of, this machines need to perpetuate itself, and i think talking about it in those terms and saying that the capitalism came first is important so that you can see the mechanisms in every moment that need to be pushed, you can see the real uh uh pressure points and not get caught. in moral questions that aren't meant to be resolved that exist to keep us perpetually batting at fucking yarn in a cage, so the war, the war between conservatives and liberals that's heating up now, the the the the genuine drop in investment essentially the boomer going to war over woodstock over the cultural revolution of the 60s and 70s one and the urban finance end of capitalism in collision course finally with its with the tail end which was the formation of local extraction economy based uh capital formations in the slave south. and they've been banging and they've been uh, they've been in conflict, their conflict is driven American politics. for a period there was a working class element that became a tri that became a third uh poll, and you had a sort of tripartite political structure for a minute there, then that broke again back to the two, back to the dynamic between these two parts of capital, petty and small urban and and uh and rural bourgeois, basically now... international and national bourjois, they're having their partisan war that is becoming deeply charged, one part has completely at the grassroots given up on investing in any institutions or norms and that goes through the entire organization, meaning yeah, they'll fucking cancel an election if they can, of course they would, because democrats would let them, because democrats are even more comfortable, they believe themselves to be even more comfortable, even more snug. reason they're liberals, the reason that they're happy to uh put the rainbow flag of things they believe on their yard and in and uh and endorse theoretical diversity is that they feel more secure in capitalism's bosom than the uh the national bourgeois do and again we're talking about the people actually make decisions and who things are generated around not the regular schmucks who are just responding to them, they think they're comfortable. they're all terrified, they've convinced themselves of the boogy man because of their racism, or but all of that even is driven by the fact that they're being crushed, they are being crushed, they will be absorbed into the the international finance, and they will personally either become cuckified rich people and therefore lose their identity, or they're going to keep their keep their identity and become poor, that is something they feel and that... makes them terrified and all of their fears get manifested in things like race, they they are afraid of being dominated, they see the way black people are this country are treated and they imagine that in this new global world where they're on the bottom they will be treated that way too, but at the lightly higher levels, at the levels of Hollywood, at the level of the fucking tenured academy, my god where people live in these tastefully segregated uh integrated neighborhoods or gentrified neighborhoods or in inner ring suburbs where they get their diversity mark largely through the media and therefore they don't have to have fear or their fear can be transmitted into uh anxiety about the bad white people, they get to sublimate their racial anxiety onto the bad white people, which is why they freak out about Trump, they're sublimating the their anxiety to this other group, whereas look at and both of them are imagining a future that's going to get worse, they don't imagine anything better, but what they imagine is their enemy suffering, and so we are getting to a point of crisis, if things get much worse, i mean if supply chain disruption really becomes a thing, if the fucking tap of mountain dew runs out, if the economy drops again, if there's another if they try to uh mandatory vaccines, if there's another attempt a lockdown or a first attempt a national lockdown, who knows, if there's a close election, this is all being generated by one class at war with itself, and because we're all experiencing politics as this, our categories get confused, because most of the people on the left. they're on the same cultural side as the liberals, and they have overlapping values at a certain level, and so they feel the need to address those in their lives, and they do, but there's a conflict at the heart of that that can only be pierced by piercing the moral fog around all questions, that that envelops everything online. so I am all about demoralizing our historical analysis, demoralizing our opinions about shit, taking away the sense of of of selfworth that comes with watching something or listening to something or reading something or telling something or posting something, now that you say that's rich coming from you, of course, but hey, I'm also being. compensated for this, remember, so that's going to make it much easier for me, if you're not being compensated for this in anything other than like a psychic wage of moral virtue, if you remove that energy, if you remove that force behind your engagement, things become clear, you regain, you get something like a post nut clarity, actually, you have nutted yourself of your your morals, backed up anima, your your repressed richean uh orgon that you have been uh sublimating into this mind battle, this fuck, you're putting this energy into a mind war, blast it off. see someone says have people logged off, no, nobody listen to you, i've said this before, but nobody's logging off, logging off is not a possibility, because our social, there's no such thing as a person, right? we are a cloud of influences, we are so and beyond the fact that we're made up of that we've encountered, we also cannot define ourselves by anything but comparison, so that means we are we we experience. technological sphere increases, now of course, this is good, i mean in a dialectical historical sense, this is necessary, you have to create class consciousness across geography, and that requires being able to engage with ideas about personhood that extend throughout all of humanity, so that's necessary, but as it increases, our sense of self becomes mediated. so if everyone logged off, it would leave you in the same life you lived, I mean presuming you live the same life, with essentially a limb removed, you will, you would find yourself unable to uh, navigate the world because of how much of your understanding of what the world is comes from this, this zone, this abstract zone, so we're all we all have to do it to some extent. Now I think some people could cut it off if they were going to change their life in a significant way, like if you join a commune, you probably can log completely off, if you read if you... are able to create a situation where you are able to replace, have that cut off limb regrow in the form of a a news uh uh um new relationship to others, if you start organizing, you can probably cut off completely, but you know, well, but if you still... are where you are, and most of us are, because we don't get to choose that, you know, we can try to direct the ship, but we can't just redirect, we cannot dictate terms immediately, we cannot take a moment of clarity and try to reshuffle the deck completely, we're still constrained, which is why you can never talk about someone being in you, about in a, you cannot talk about there being some like moment of of illumination where we all come together. and we all have an understanding because every moment we're being josled away from that and directing things differently takes time so shrinking reducing the size of it, reducing the vitalness of it as an organ of self-conception is is laudible, but I stopped telling people to log off a while ago. It's more about reorienting your uh emotional relationship to it, because then that will dictate how much time you spend there, because if you do not invest these questions with moral moral energy, they become a lot less interesting. you know what if somebody's just literally pitched crypto, that's very funny, you know what, blockchain, the beauty of this thing is is that if this is true, if the the resistance to capitalism is within our like technological infrastructure is finally coming into fruition through the blockchain and crypto, if that's true, it's going to happen no matter what i think about it, i will not be contributing in any way because i don't know shit. I must focus, I must, I must emphasize it on this point on the the question of technology, I mean I don't know much about much, but I know shit about fuck, about fucking technology, I understand the arguments for blockchain, the way that it could keep money from being, it would be able to prevent capital flight uh, and and tax evasion and stuff, okay, I read that in ministry for the future uh, but you know all the crypto currencies seem like speculative assets of an economy that's run out of profitable uh investment opportunities, i mean that definitely seems to have been the motive, forget anything, oh we're going to destable, whatever libertarian crackpot notions undergird it's building and i bet that was the motivation because those people were motivated, they really believe that shit because they have aligned their politics with their sense of self-interest, they think libertarianism will get them rich, so they'll work for free because they've convinced themselves that they're gonna this thing is going to work for them even though for most of them it absolutely will not, they will be destroyed spiritually and uh financially, but they really believe that shits and they have the technological, those guys have technological aspects man, that's one place that the right has the left feet. ways to Sunday is that those fucking nerds, those libertarian nerds, they love the uh computers and they know how they work, and the left is a bunch of fucking humanities graduates, self-included, so whatever those guys were thinking, very quickly it became first money laundering uh device. for avoiding taxes and buying things illegally, which is a tax issue at the end of the day and a currency issue uh, like they're basically the government basically says, you can't, that money is no good for that thing, you can't buy that with this, and over timeime as a speculative asset, i mean honestly i'm... people have as a long-term investment opportunity and as a short-term like uh shake the money tree type thing, it just seems like the profit motive is dominated it completely and that you would need that counterweight of people within it all pushing in the same direction out of not self-interest, not financial interest i should say, and i don't see the structures within it to uh to encourage that, so once again, that's about as much thought as I have to put into it, because it would be dumb of me to have a strong opinion on bitcoin or cryptocurrency or to spend much time talking about it, because I i know with the time I have on this earth, I'm not going to be learning about it, that's for sure. I do think that the amount of fucking energy it uses is monstrous and I do think that the basic, the the phenomenon of of cryptocurrency and NFTs is the market looking for. speculative assets where they cannot be found, because even speculative profits are now largely being worked out of the system, like long-term profits, which of course are always are are been trending down since the 70s are now such that you can't even get into a volatile market now, and so there so the thing i can't get over with this shit is that. they literally take economic growth, which is supposed to be uh, what investment creates, like you invest money so that work is done, right? and that work then creates more value, that is then profit that you get to take, right? that's the capitalist cycle. now that work is involves human labor, it involves technology, it involves natural. resources of some kind, some sort of input, and it involves externalities in the form of uh pollution, and energy used for the transaction, at the end of which you have a thing, in some way, in some respect you have a thing, that is then that then contributes to like the built economy and can then serve as the purpose for more growth. bitcoin removes the productive part of... the investment cycle leaves the creation of energy, the way the use of energy and the uh the uh exhaust of externalities in the form of uh of these goddamn bitcoin mining rigs using electricity and and and pumping carbon into the atmosphere, without actually producing anything, that is just that. the death, that's the death spiral, man, that is capitalism at the terminal point, where the profit motive has outstripped all signals from the fucking uh, the system, all actual contact with it have been stripped, there is no more human to animal to biome connection to the imperative for fucking uh, profit, and at the end of that you have a situation where there's no more, this thing cannot uh innovate anymore, this thing cannot be a progressive force, it is an outlasted, it's historic purpose, like i said, marx didn't think capitalism was evil, he thought it was, and and this is one of the another place where moral. gets confused is that at the time w Marx was writing capitalism was serving historical purpose, he thought that that purpose was coming to an end and that's when he was that why he predicted imminent revolution uh, but colonialism and the United States basically saved it, colonial uh domination and super exploitation of resources in the perfery saved capitalism, in a way that Marx could not have predicted, we're now at the point where... Capitalism has fully exhausted its historic role, it's progressive role of creating innovation, of concentrating capital, of creating cultural superstructures, stallages of ideas and uh and institutional knowledge that could be used to direct a technological society towards social ends, to to take the machine and reprogram it, to turn the terminate. aftermath of that failure, and so now capitalism is deeply immoral and everything, you can't even say it's it's progressive anymore, it does not even serve historic purpose, it is just because obviously it was also immorral and marx used very scornful language to condemn the immorality of the ruling class, but they were also fulfilling of a historic role. now they are just evil, just pure evil. Consumption is evil if it has replaced uh morality which is which it has and by morality I mean a fully consumption is a part of life but it is like anything supposed. to be fixed in a matrix with other parts of life, meaning other things other stories of value, let's put it that way, the value form in capitalism overwhelms eventually all values, and and exchange value is the only value, but those are of course the difference between those two things, which is an lusory fantasy, and if we and we live in a culture and a society, we live in a society that has reifified that into a principle that dominates all others to a way that is not sustainable, i mean it's going to destroy the world, not end life on earth probably, but destroy what it thinks it's creating, destroy the thing that it's supposed to serve, which is human civilization. I mean my god, you have this motherfucker going to space, you have this goblin, saying thank you to the Amazon workers and customers for paying for this. as if there's any deal we could make with him that would make that uh that what would mean we won? like you can talk all day about oh i got 500 soccks in uh i clicked a button i got 500 socks to my house in two hours okay congratulations you got that convenience you got that consumption but what did you give up for it and what you gave up for is every other part of humanity and your own ability to determine your life like at a basic level you've given it yourself over to a machine we all have. and we get to watch this guy go, hey, i'm going to pretend to go to space, i'm gonna pretend to go to space, i'm going to do something that isn't even fucking space travel, something the Russians figured out in the fucking uh 50s with two tin cans tied together, nope, sorry, someone on twitter pointed this out and i think it's it's true, it's that he clearly sat down with his his his space dudes and said, okay, i want to go to space, how can i do that in a way that doesn't require me to train and isn't going to kill me? and they said, we'll just take you up and like show you the curvature of the earth, it's just a it's just a big boy goes on a fucking plane ride and then he comes down and says, we're going to take all of the factories and put them in outer space, which is such an should be an such an insult to the mind of anyone, how anyone can hear some say someone say that and not instantly be he disenchanted from capitalism astoounds me. this man is more money than anybody in on earth, he directly benefits from exploitation of people and their labor at every point in a global supply chain of misery, by any any system of value that is wrong, unless he deserves it, and that is capitalist morality, he is there because he deserves it. how could he deserve it? now the old days hierarchy was upheld by saying he deserves because god put him there, shut up. liberalism came along, rationalism came along, the enlightenment science, it became harder to convince people of that, and so that became they're there because of a meritocratic process that put them there as they should, and that was the liberal revolution, to take the industrial revolution and replace orders of superstition with rational orders. of merit, that was the French revolution, that was Napoleon marching across Europe, that was the 19th century, was the imposition of those ideas that by the 20th century were hegemonic, and then eventually overwhelmed the world. hejamonic in the westish, so now you have a situation where we have this so-called meritocracy that of course a lot of people don't believe in, some people say, leftists say, it's not a meritocracy because meritocracy is fake, but liberals will say no, meritocracy is just not perfectly implemented, and the multicultural liberal u project is the attempt to impose a perfect meritocracy through affirmative action, through redistribution necessary to get to that point. so according to liberals, We are going, we are more meritocratic than they used to be, but we're not meritocratic enough. The important thing is that we are meritocratic enough so that every individual liberal deserves to be where they are in the system, if they're benefiting from it, if they feel like they're benefiting from it. That is the that's the neat coincidence. Is it, yes, there's a lot of white people who succeed but shouldn't a lot of... men and my right ladies, but not me. now there are a lot of liberals though, who say, uh, no, it's not that racist, calm down, but there are also conservatives, who aren't full race warriors, who do think that you know what even though there's affirmative action and and and the media and stuff, we still basically have a fair system of capitalism, so like i would say the... the center, the vital center of capitalist belief in this country says, we have a system that is meritocratic enough that the richest man on earth should deserve that through some sort of genius, some sort of uh ability, equal to that amount of money, and that motherfucker came back from space and said, we got to shoot all the factories into orbit, now either he really believes that. and if he really believes that, he is a fucking moroon and he does not deserve to be up there, or he's lying to you, which means that he is not a uh maridocrat, but a fraud, either way he should not be there. and certainly the fact that he believe he thinks you're going to believe him is the should be the ultimate insult, more than anything, the fact that he fucking thinks that some portion of you are going to believe him, either agree with him or even think he thinks that, he does not have any uh respect, that's for sure, but yeah, no, nobody who says something like that, after blowing all that money and then telling people, yeah, this is your money and blowing, goes up, does that, comes back, has that result, can possibly say that capitalism has not failed, it has failed, in that it has fulfilled its historical fucking destiny and is still hanging around, we have to rebuild some some sort of workers resistance to it that can contest for power as it declines, which it is. i was supposed to talk about black jacobins today, but i ended up going off on a bit of a tangent. uh, you know what, next week, i'll do uh, i might just do the whole rest of the... next week because the thing is it's much more uh it's it's much less detail oriented than um than the other books we've done the historical ones anyway like uh reconstruction it's it's much more like sweeping narrative so uh how about for next week i'll just read the rest of it. All right, I hope some of that made sense. Bye-bye.
