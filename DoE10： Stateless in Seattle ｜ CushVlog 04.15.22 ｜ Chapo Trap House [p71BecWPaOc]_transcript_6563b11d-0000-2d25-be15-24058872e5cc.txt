 Come on, get up, get up, get down with the sickness, you fucker, get up, get down with the sickness, fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness, open up your heat and let it flow into me, I can see the sickness is rising, and you see all this good has died, oh yeah, the world is a scary place. come on, you know we die, get up, come on, get down with the sickness, you fucker get up, come on, get down with the sickness, you fucker get up, come on, get down with the sickness, open up your hate and let it flow into me. Oh yes, it is a sick outfit, thank you, I'm uh, I'm looking fresh to death, it's what I'm all about these days, looking fresh to death, and I'm doing it, I'm doing it my way, oh right, yeah, I don't, I'm not on that, I'm out here, I'm out here, I'm out here uh, trapping. so today we're going to be doing chapter 10 uh of the dawn of everything, which is a pretty important chapter, i'd say it's it's it's i think it's the longest so far and it's definitely one where a lot of the strands of their arguments are starting to really come together into a a uh like a coherent thesis. that the more I read about it honestly, the less uh, importance it seems to have to me, like I, I, I find myself largely agreeing with what they're saying, and and and agreeing with how what they're saying is a challenge to, and alternative to, really, the conventional narratives of of human civilization, but the more I find it like get this point, the more I kind of also think at the same time, well who cares, what difference does it make, like they they're the the underlying premise here is that this new understanding of human history has a political violence, like all of the sort of squinting and wishcasting and uh creative interpretation of evidence that they do, they do pretty exclusive uh pretty explicitly on the service of a political agenda, and again I don't. have a problem with that, i i i admire the the um the frankness of that, because obviously everybody is doing that all the time is just we're always supposed to pretend and lie about the fact that it that it's happening or and give them credit for being explicit with it, but like the political valence of their argument to me seems totally frankly non-existent, like if everything they say is true about how humans civilizations evolve, i still don't know how it changes the price of uh butter, you know, how it has any influence on the question of politics in the here and now uh, and i'll get into why, but like just to start with that's what i'm kind of getting with as i'm reading this, so just to summarize what's in the chapter, which is uh, why the state has no origin, the humble beginnings of bureaucracy and politics, so this is where they're making uh a challenge to conventional evolutionary models for human civilization that say there's this thing called the state that has these features and which evolves basically alongside the complexity of human uh social organization people uh as soon as you get a certain number of people the the the old argument goes a state will come into being to manage them that that is what they are in this chapter. most, that is the argument that they are trying to subvert and challenge, and one, the first way they do that is pointing out, this is a pretty kind of... no brainer really uh nobody can seem to agree on what the fuck a state is, there are a bunch of different understandings and explanations for what what what you have to have socially to have a state uh and if that's the case it makes you wonder well then what the hell is even is this thing if it has no stable definition if if it's if the definition of it seems to be motivated by the underlying assumptions and and preferences, again the political element of the person studying them, so what they do is they bake down uh civilization, the state into three things that exist in all modern states uh, and that you might argue, evolve at some point in human history, somewhere, but they're going to point out are not. not connected necessarily, which is what state formation theory previously assumed, and they are sovereignty, that is monopoly of violence over territory, ability to determines and dies, basically, in modern in modern, in modern Schmiddian terms, deciding the state of exception, the other is, and that is, and that is associated with like i said a monopoly on violence and the and the uh the infliction of violence. only me or people that i explicitly uh authorize can carry out violence. that is a element of the state. uh, and that is a monopoly and a hording of violence. the second one is administrative capability, which is essentially a monopoly and a hording on information. and the third is charismatic politics. that is the ability to get people to do things just because you're that awesome, you are able to demonstrate to them just how fucking awesome you are and how you deserve to be listened to and given things uh and those three things are all to be found in like a mature state and traditional models that they're once again challenging say these th things come into being not all at once but in a sequence and that's and and it's determined by uh once again complexity of administering a bunch of people so in in in the traditional uh model of this the one that comes first is always administration it is you got you got once you get x number of people and they're doing y amount of complex uh economic activity and and and surplusses, then you need to administer their actions, and that that then becomes the the uh thing that generates charismatic politics, as people justify or vy for positions within this administration, which of course is going to you be directing uh orders in in one direction and people are going to be situated along it, and how do they do that? absent, formal mechanisms that haven't been developed yet, other than uh charismatic competitive politics, and that once you have this strata of power over uh, seeing this administrative apparatus, boom, you've got sovereignty, because now you have charismatic leaders with control of administrative apparatuses who can use those practices to uh monopolize violence. this is not a fitted by the way, it's got the classic thing in the back. i'm not, i'm not one of those. i don't even know my fucking head size, i couldn't get up fitted. uh, and so what grab grow argue is that that is not some sort of fixed, natural, inexorable order. uh that the uh mesopotamian civilizations we've talked about that had these uh relatively egalitarian uh structures of distribution uh in the cities right oh fuck i flipped i got this wrong no i'm sorry uh what i'm describing is what happened in mesoamerica where you have this administration and then you have the emergence on the periphery. of charismatic politicians who then take it over and use it to ever sovereignty. the traditional definition is from administration to sovereignty and then finally uh a charismatic politics divised to ratify those two things together, but they're saying that mesoamerica is another model, and that there's a model where you have charismatic like origin myths emerge from competition, and then sovereignty adhering to those individuals, and then those individuals using that sovereignty to order people essentially to create an administration. so the point is there's no fixed way, there's a bunch of ways that these three things three things can come together, which means traditional notions of a conveyor belt of state formation are wrong. uh, and then to make this point, they uh, pull up three examples of civilizations that emerged uh, early in human history, uh, where one of these three elements of sovereignty are fixated upon and and and uh and structures are built to uh reinforce without the other two uh and the first example is in mesoamerica where you have uh where you had the olmex uh who were the progenitor civilization uh in mesoamerica before there were any aztecs or any inc. or or any mias uh who whose civilization such that it has left its mark is - a is completely fixated on ritual competitive sport between aristocratic warriors uh these ball game where you like hit a rubber ball with your hip and try to get it into a little little hoop uh that was you know endemic among mesoamerican civilizations and that's that the aztex uh also uh played but but all of their uh residual physical culture is fixed on displaying uh scenes of this competition uh and this is like this is an embodiment of a uh a social order you wouldn't call it a state but a a a social order organized around charismatic politics, but which doesn't really feature any evidence of a meaningful administrative capacity, besides the ability to administrate the war, the the the wars and the sports that you know basically blend together, or any real sovereignty extended beyond the territory of the ritual space. uh, they call this a theater state, where the implication is is that... uh rather than being like a fixed uh structure, it is a temporary, perhaps seasonal coming together where these games and sports are carried off and then everybody kind of goes back and does their own thing. uh, the implication here is that a lot of the stuff that we see uh in ancient uh like physical remainders, you know, temple complexes and and art that points to people who are like you, state brained towards a world of like total domination and like permanent structures of control, could very well be a situation where the vast majority of people are either are either humoring to just get all get along with or actively participating as uh enthusiastic spectators to a temporary expression of like aristocratic uh contest between warriors. but one that does not actually uh deal that does not actually generate a capacity for sovereignty or administration that doesn't actually like rule over anybody, not permanently, so this is a state a state let or whatever where you see one of the three legs and not the other two. uh, another example, then this is the most interesting one, i've never heard of this, and obviously you as you can imagine and you'll figure out why in a second, this is very interesting to me uh, there is this uh complex in the Peruvian andes called shaving, my handwriting is bad, huantar, i believe, which is essentially, which is in its physical remainders, what were what we found and looked at uh that was built and left, is a society organized around tripping balls, uh, the artwork. and the uh structures that are left are these psychodelic depictions of forms not stabilized as they are in most ancient art where you have this is a tiger, this is a human and this is an eagle, and they're in some sort of interaction with each other, rather human and animal shapes that went in and out of each other, if anyone if that feels familiar to anybody's ever ever had a psychodelic experience, and that like their temple complexes rather than being a big big open place for people to witness some ritual, are rather a network of a labyrinthine tunnels and that people are led that presumably people would be led through in small numbers or and in some cases uh only uh through narrow hallways or narrow passageways that could only allow one person uh and that at the center of this one complex there's this fucking uh this carved and engraved stelley this pediment that presumably someone would at the end of a psychedelic journey come to and then bear witness to and come out of that experience with some sort of knowledge. uh that would then be, I mean, by definition, esoterically held by people who had been initiated into the process, so here we see a civilization organized around the hording of knowledge that is the basic premise of administrative capacity, but again, no charismatic politics, there's no, there's nothing indicating any individuals in any of this, any of this art, and no sovereignty of any kind, extending beyond the immediate. area where these rituals are carried out, and uh, I honestly think that if we really want to say, how did we get stuck, how did civilization get where it is, where we got stuck in this out of instead of the shifting and protean, movement of people that characterized early civilization, and I got to say at the end of the day, I'm probably as a as a neopite, I'm relatively convinced at this point of the grabgrow idea of early human uh so... order, not as people on different levels of a continuum, but as a constantly shifting and pulsating ball until until you get to a point where all these societies they they like, they encounter one another, they are changed by their encounter, they uh create stable uh stability and homeostasis within a certain situation, they come into encounter with each again, they break up, but they're never uh, there nothing is ever fixed and and structured, because more than anything, the fact that people can move, the fact that human uh, the human civil, the human numbers relative to the size of the planet and it's resources are such that all real conflicts can be resolved by a moving, by going somewhere else, and and that that the uh intoxicating uh um the intoxicating malliability of of society that grab grow uh paint here uh can be uh maintained due to the malliability of the world the literal environment we find ourselves in because there is not the same the the stakes of resource conflict are different uh but then we got stuck. they and they themselves describe it as being stuck and and and you know once you get to dominant states then all of this stuff in my opinion goes out the window which is a big reason that i i kind of wonder what the political utility of this is because it it it wipes the it it it becomes a process of that that like flow that human flow that characterized like the global human community is is is interrupted and reversed and eventually, and it's it's a one way ratchet of those uh, those non, rationalized and dominated spaces being rationalized and dominated, and where does it start? I think it starts in those esoteric rituals that certain adepts find themselves engaging with in or in these societies for the necessary uh task of providing... a religious narrative for the society, which is inherent and necessary, you want to talk about things that are not viable, that's one of them, because to have a social order is to have a agreed upon, you can call it a narrative, you can call it a fantasy, you can call ideology, whatever it is, and it could be, it is to one degree spiritual and another uh secular, no matter what, it is both of those things, and so there was there always going to be people who are going to be better at telling stories, there are going to be people who are better at convincing a narrative, this goes back to the charisma thing, like yes, the warriors are able to but that physical prowess is not necessarily uh go with an ability to narrate their actions and it's the narrative of the actions that actually keeps things stuck together that actually maintains social cohesion, it is not the acts, it is the remembering of the acts and and by definition, the people who are going to deal that narrative cannot be the people who actually did them. there going to be people who observed, so I'm talking basically about the indoor kids, the nerds, they're always going to be there, and they're going to be fundamental to the to the uh maintenance of any social structure, as fundamental as the warrior class and everyone will know that, and how do you how do you keep telling these stories in a way that convinces everybody, including and this is the... part, you, because this is not a self-conscious uh uh thing at this point, there is no uh, position of like radical skepticism of uh of uh phenomenon, i mean yes, but it cannot be expressed, it cannot be validated, because the social body is too overdetermining, it is extinguished by the continual, non-stop interaction towards the common goal of survival, so you're convincing everybody, including yourself, and one thing that helps with that, big time is psychedelic, and maintaining your ability to narrate involves ritually encountering esoteric knowledge through the heightning of senses, which is what psychodelics at the end of the day do. This is yes so people saying oh duality dualism, yes this is an imposed dualism, it is a lie agreed upon, and I would argue that the thing that allows you to dominate your fellow man, is when enough of that group of people in a social order encounter the esoteric knowledge of non-dualism, the thing that can't persist socially because we need dualism to evaluate our our environment and interact with it, like on a moment by moment basis we need to think in oppositions, so we won't encounter non-dualism except in specific. moments of contemplation, reflection, like the buddha sitting underneath the damn bania tree, or if you're too busy for any of that, are psychodelics, but psychedelics matched with a specific ritual, buse remember, when we're talking about this Shavin complex, it's not just blank walls, right? like these are images that have been agreed upon to be depicted, to lead you in a certain direction. and one of the things that can come from like the encounter with non-duality and then having your encounter with non-duality confirmed by others in an esoteric sect, one of the things you can the one of the realizations that can be come to, especially I would argue in conditions of crisis, ecological or otherwise, conflict with other humans and changing ecological conditions. that the same lie that you all tell each other every day about there being some difference between you as a group and the world around you is going to have to be furthered by a new lie that there is some difference between us within the group because and we will rationalize it in our in our temples, it's the only way that we will able to be to be able to people to respond to the crisis that we see in time, because these wonderful deliberative processes that grab girl love to jack off about are inefficient, and they would agree with that, yes, they're gloriously inefficient, they're wondrously inefficient, yes in times of fecundity, they are, they are a luxury that can be afford under certain conditions. and when that luxury could no longer be afforded, the the amount of uh time you give to getting consensus has to be constrained, and that means consensus has to be defined differently, not everybody agreeing, but most people agreeing, and the rest giving up one way or the other, out of some threat or brow brow beating, and then how, and then the greater the crisis, the more that uh, decision-making power has to be abbregated. so he says efficiency is not valuable, perfect, yes, because value is the the uh underlying premise of value is scarcity, and the societies that grab grow are jacking off to are ones where scarcity has been effectively abbregated, not all the time, but out of the equations of like social life written out of our decision-making matrix. value comes into it when consensus is can no longer be afforded. so this society shavon here is the uh is the ball stripping culture where you have ' uh a a surplus uh redistribution effort that goes into the creation of uh a alter that creates esoteric rather than public knowledge like the olmex are doing huge public spectacle to overraw and and impress their uh their neighbors basically like grabgro could argue we don't think of it so much as to overpower them but to you know vent their need to be seen and to be valued and to be uh to be applauded and then they get it off their chest and then they can go back and to being like basically equal to everybody else uh outside of that time frame which is you know that's the that's the will to power that formulates uh that that drives people towards a political life. the opposite is this shoven where all of the uh public art is designed to move the elect, those who can perceive and re-express it uh towards esoteric knowledge that is, perhaps taken and then brought with one back to one's community, essentially a sacred college for the shaman or or or wise men or narrators of the community to come here have this experience and then go... back with this knowledge, but like the way that the almex like what we're describing with the olmex is that is essentially uh that is the military arm of the state embodied, like the fundamental of the military and then you have the psychology of the the bureaucrat the bureaucratic state extending to and defined by really more than anything the academy right, the cathedral if we're talking in mold buggy in terms, this is where we actually like structure our narrative standing the world, which gives the army guys a mission and motivation to fight, but which here's the important part, this administrative structure, built around esoteric knowledge, cannot be in charge of a real state, it needs a thing on top of it, and that is sovereignty embodied at a single point. that is the king, and here we come to the last civilization, the natzs in uh the lower uh Mississippi Gulf coast area, Louisiana, where uh, all the surplus of the of the social structure is brought to being in creating this uh great village where... the uh Nachez son lives, the god the king who has absolute sovereignty over everyone, in his immediate vicinity. he can take any wife he wants, he can kill anyone he wants, he can take any objects from anyone, he can violate every rule that they had, every law, because the lawgiver must be above the law, the law biver cannot be constrained by the law or else he's not the giver of it, you have to be beyond good and evil to define good and evil, and that is what the monarch, that's what the uh sovereign is for, uh, but again, here only sovereignty, because outside of the great village where he doesn't leave, nobody has to pay attention to the king, nobody, nobody takes his orders if they don't want to follow them, and he has no administrative state to uh, even tell anybody what to do, but you have this this unlimited sovereignty in an individual, which of course is then attenuated by those other things, it's attenuated by having a military, it's attenuated by having a administrative capacity. but then in its person it is able to basically hide and mystify the hand of the academy, because the reason you can't have the academy ruling directly, the bureaucratic class ruling ruling directly is because while they might be totally uh uh unable to see the self-interest that motivates their actions because they're ideologize like the rest of us, they've they've enchanted, the important thing to understand here is they're not enchanting when they take power. when they when they when they redirect social structures away from communal life, they're not doing it cynically, they're not doing it, oh i'm going to trick these fuckers, they're doing it because they have collectively come to a realization about what they think is necessary to survive and then covered it with their uh faith in one another, the their trust which comes from having a definition apart from everyone else, that is people have the knowledge, people know that this is all fake, that there is no world, there's no distinctions here, but we're still bodies with feelings and emotions and desires and needs, would rather not experience suffering, so we have to work together as though we were different in. order to reduce suffering, but that is a contradiction, because now once we're separate, fear takes over our relationship to the other. so this is all the stuff that goes into the subconscious transformation that occurs within like the the the academic shamanic, storytelling narrative class, but while their self-interest is invisible to them, it is nakedly clear to everybody else. if you are not in this class and you are part of a rapidly solidifying order of hierarchy that you're at the bottom of, and he's insisting to you that it's for the good and it's what God wants, him stuck in his subjectivity, doesn't recognize the vast. inexperience between you know sitting around the fire and eating berries and whatever the fuck and being in the fields doing fucking agricultural labor being at one end of the spear of the other, so that becomes like an x-ray machine, shows the self-interest and creates alienation, you can't have that, you need an embodied sovereign standing in front of this uh this bureaucratic consensus. and mystifying it with his person which stands outside of human interest, which is not the true of the administrators, so here we have three societies, each with a fixation around one of these three elements of sovereignty that doesn't contain any of the others, and I think the best way to explain that is, this is society. influx, this is society that is seasonally and geographically unbound, this is society where we might look back through history and see these physical structures that were left behind, and we might decide that they were the determining factors of the social order, but what was actually the case is that they are all temporary products of a temporary bringing together of people who might share a culture, share a language, but whose lives are largely spent? responding to the cycles of nature, and these things we have, the the the the olmek uh ritual game palaces and the shavoian uh uh balls tripping palaces and the natz great village of of ultimate sovereignty and the great son is you have different ways for different uh groups within a social order not by like rank or hierarchy but just affinity aesthetic affinity like the olmex the jocks the shovins the the nerds uh and the nats uh the... uh, the beautiful, somebody with some physical, mental, inherented distinction from the people around them, that is that these remains, remnats are these groups coming together and the society in general creating a ritual to allow them to either facilitate their abili the the skills, facilitate ' to facilitate the sharpening of the skills that they need in their communities, so like the Omex, they really fucking needed good warriors, because it was a context of small states all fighting each other. Shavon, it's uh, you need the uh, the shamen, I don't know, maybe because of the the ruggedness of the environment, because than most civilizations that emerge in the lowlands, this one emerges in the in the treasurous Andies, and then in Nachez you have this, this overpowering sovereignty, probably because when everybody got together, because of how far away they were uh and how little they interact with each other because of just how far they could wander in this incredible abundancy without hitting any... else, when they get back together, they can't stop fighting one another, they're they're not, they don't have a common experience enough to avoid conflict, so you need a sovereign with sovereign power to in that moment when everyone's together uh, keep everyone chilled out, this is this is all just me, you know imagining, but like that is the notion is that in this in this flow of human civilization, this up and down, this uh, this steady state. a lava lamp of so human social forms, what we're looking at when we look at archaeological evidence is just the sedimentary remnant of places where certain groups who spent most of their time in uh control of their own lives in all the ways that grab defined grab define like being able to make to make and change social relationships to be able to move away uh there's one other one whatever they're all there in in in abundance. and that what we have is not a permanent structure of dominance that emerges as soon as people come together, but rather the ornamental and uh the ornaments of the necessary structures that emerge in those moments of concentration to facilitate everybody living together and everybody living apart, and again I find this a very persuasive description of uh of the... the reality of social change before the emergence of the of the real mature state, and like part of the argument they make with this is they point out that there is this strong uh, um, there is a strong bias against dark ages and interregnums uh in the historical record when people are looking back on it, because they don't leave all the pretty shit, they it's only in the high uh um the apogy of like dynastic oppression and and expansion that you see these golden ages of material culture and when there's when when there isn't that when you have like fewer remaining uh pieces of physical culture like beautiful masks and and uh and pots and all this stuff and you have less of that and the stuff you do have is of uh is lower quality, it's more utilitarian, maybe because that that surpluss isn't being held in the cities and held in the in the temples, but it's being used in the day-to-day by people, and that you have as complex a civilization, you have as uh, you have all the same structures of cooperation that you have in those periods of high dominance, but you don't have a physical re'. of them and so they become just these periods of of anarchy, and again i find that very, very persuasive as an explanation of how this stuff, how we get these narratives and and how they hide what? really was going on um and so in trying to get figure out how we get like more uh mature states out of this flow we go back to Egypt where uh grabro point out that the uh figure of the king and later the pharaoh in Egyptian society uh stands above human human but does not display. that uh charismatically, there is no culture of competition among humans in a ancient Egyptian aristocracy, the pharaoh stood alone and unchallenged, the only real public rituals the pharaoh ever did were like a chariot race or chariot ride or something where they were the only person going, all those contests have been settled by the gods in the heavens, so there's no charismatic uh culture, but eventually you do see this really intense uh administration emerge around the king in the form of uh caring for him, because this unchallenged god king requires a lot of care and feeding, he becomes basically a little baby, and that's why uh monarchy is like the one of the only uh political structures that has any that has kids involved in any way. because a baby could be a king, baby cannot be - a ruler in any other social structure, and that's because that sovereignty is in the is is in the person itself, it's not justified by acts the way it would be in a charismatic uh politics, it's it's fixed to the person, and that means that the person has to essentially be treated like a god, and that means fed and bathed and and and pampered, and that means the the... employment of a bunch of people to do that, which requires surpluss to be given, first to them and then to the to the king, but then like the king can't die either, because if it's if it's their body itself is embodied is imbued with godliness, then then that has to persist beyond death, if it doesn't, then why are we doing any of this stuff? none of it will last, there is no reason to suborn ourselves to this, even ritually, the ritual has no hold, unless the king is preserved beyond death, unless we wrap him up and hold him up and continue to feed and water him, and grab grow here uh make a an argument that the real thing that led to uh the bureaucratic regime of agriculture extraction in Egypt was feeding, was getting food and drink, beer and bread to dead kings, because for some reason, and it's amazing that don't even... stop to ask, hey, i wonder how this happened, uh, it was decided by who, who do you think decided this, that the food and drink that the kings, the dead kings uh consumed, wasn't the same one that we mostly consumed, the living, the living mostly consumed stuff that was uh, accessible with relatively low uh effort, low labor input food stuffs, they could make beer and they could make uh bread out of wheat, but that was a higher amount of calories and put it, that was a higher amount of labor required, so they mostly didn't, they used this special occasion, but the king only drinks beer, the king only eats bread, so now to feed and uh water this this dead guy, to keep him eating pizza and budwizer, you create a permanent structure of agricultural surplus extraction, and again it's amazing, they've laid out all of this how this happens and they don't stop, they just stop there and they say, oh no see that... what caused it, it wasn't the agriculture that created the state, it was the other way around, like once again, they're only making the narrow point that uh, it was in flux, well how about we try to determine some direction here, who the hell is deciding what the goddamn uh god king eats or drinks? it's not the god king, it's the priests, it's the priestly class, you don't think they recognize? which types of food require what sort of social structures that then bequeath unto them administrative capacities and sovereign capacities, so we have is uh this sovereign god king who is now and hearing sovereignty and or I mean it's adhering uh even without like the uh the warrior culture. he is able to assert authority through this regime of agriculture to uh to feed him now this is unstable and collapses and i maybe you can understand you can see what the problem is here uh the reason that the god that the that the uh god king becomes immobile basically uh becomes not a warrior not someone has to challenge his challenge and prove his power in the... world, someone is born with it, is that it disempowers the warrior class, you cannot claim power through force. again, who does this serve? who is in the driver's seat? now somebody saying, oh he's blaming it on the Jews, see the Jews get blamed for this because of their... uh their position in Europe and the fact that they were not allowed to engage in the uh largely engage in like the the culture, the agricultural uh value structure uh of Europe and were forced to adhere to those middle strata, i mean they they got into the bourgeois basically because there was nowhere else to go, they were forced into it uh, but they just that's just a fucking happen stance of history, this is just a class taking power over time and that class being uh an administrative and bureaucratic class who is able to operate from a remove from other structures of power and therefore able to uh assert control other of them. now what capitalism is is when this class takes power and then creates technology that takes it away from them uh, because I would argue the capitalism is inevitable unless something else changes, but I could argue no, like if we're talking about like this in fluid dynamic terms, capitalism is inevitable as soon as uh, a permanent regimes of state power become hegemonic, as soon as they can no longer be challenged by uh other structures, because one they will always beat the... other structures because of their advantages in efficiency uh and two uh they are inherently uh like any other social structure uh in conflict with like the lived environment but the problem is is that without any fluid social order to take the energy away to like take the venting take the refuse created by uh the contradictions within it uh, it will crash the entire structure, but the thing is people are making decisions right, and at some point people are going, but but they only make decisions by abstracting away responsibility uh, and decision making to uh questions that can be answered and imperically, what i mean is technology is built as like a wedge to facilitate administration overing charismatic power uh and warrior uh power, military power, which is what the state is, like if the state is these two things coming together, the modern state as we understand it, one that can win against any other competitive uh, any other... uh combination of these items uh is one where uh real power has been concentrated in the burocratic and executive, but that requires a a uh programming, it requires a cultural algorithm to power every interaction within it, because these are people making decisions and they know that there's no... right answer and so they have to at the end of the day flip a coin and that is the ritual of power and the answer to that riddle that the administrative state gives is a machine can flip a coin and so we've had a fl a coin flipping our uh we've had a machine flipping the coin ever since and because this state structure within uh with uh within a like a closed ecological loop, continues to destroy itself, and class conflict powers that destruction, class conflict in conditions of a ecology that is still fluctuating, but it is now slapping against the whole of civilization rather than guiding, and the only way that power can be held in that instance, in that phenomenon is if it is. personalized is if we can wrench our spiritual conception of theself inward and away from anything else that we could recognize as human, the way that we did with the stuff that we could recognize as as something deeper than the arbitrariness of humanity in in earlier times, and this is the thing that is unidirectional and that is a teleology. whether grab grow want to admit it or not, and that is, once you have that shift, once once there's that eternal cultural, hegemonic ideology that defines the self uh differently than it used to, there's no going back from that, there's only going a furthering of the process and capitalism is merely the uncloaked technologies of that cultural programming that all uh mature states are uh than all mature states are powered by and over time it only gets worse our definition of of self becomes more inward looking and technology is what asserts that technology is what makes that first physical separation and then uh first in in space, like suburbanization, and then in time in terms of, yeah, you're you're you're not any farther away from each other than they used to be, spatially, but you now have a cyber realm that you can spend time in that is not an engagement with any other person, but is mirror merely a mirror reflection of the self, all our time spent online reflects the self and redefines. uh the self is separate and that is the technological arm of this uh this algorithm that is deeper I would argue than uh than capitalism and goes back farther. capitalism is the uh social recognition of changing conditions just as feudalism was, just as the slave empires were. oh shit. things are bad now, how can we stay on top and then reconfiguring based on what is that what is allowed to maintain those two parameters, people in charge, staying in charge, and adjusting to uh the new conditions created by the decline, the consumption of the world that cannot be uh, that cannot be redeemed faster. enough, okay, uh, so they posit that mature feronic power in Egypt emerges because this uh, baby king setup is unstable because things get worse, there's a drought, people are starving, the baby king can't do shit about it, and his bureaucracy can't do anything about it, because it would mean them doing some work which they don't want to do, so it collapses, but it does not collapse in a anarchy and and uh and in a pejorative sense, it rather outbreaks an anarchy in in a positive grave growing sense, and you go from the old kingdom to something that is referred to in the literature as the first intermediate period, a dark age before the second uh the the the new kingdom or the what the regular kingdom, the middle one, middle kingdom emerges, but grabgro says: rather than some collapse into uh into chaos that is then emerged out of sort of uh without anything having changed uh rather the formal like the power of the uh of the kingly sovereign class is reaffirmed because out of this collapse into petty principalities you emerge in a real charismatic heroic politics because people have to fight to live again people have to fight to live in these declining conditions and in so doing some people are going to fight better and by being able to fight better they're going to and and help others fight better and organize a victory and what victory means is plunder and what plunder means is people eat and that means this person now has a sovereignty invested in them by virtue of their actions, their heroic actions, and so the new pharonic power that emerges has a base in that heroic era, but of course then it grows decadent as uh, it becomes embodied in a inviable person over time, and then conditions get worse and the legitimacy is destroyed, and that's the cycle you get over and over again, and it's a cycle that we're in now, the... difference, the only thing difference between the this uh end stage crisis of the system we're in now and previous declines of empire is that there's nowhere else to go, we have run out of the the the flow in the globe because we've totalized capitalism, that is totalized dominance, predicated on resource extraction, beyond what is sustainable, beyond uh self-sufficiency, piling up. to do violence with, that is to waste it, and eventually it collapses, because within itself it cannot reform. now the marxist vision is that the specific technological reality of capitalism, and how and what all of that previous cyclical action had created as a physical culture of objects and knowledge, technology, which was currently in the hands of the administrative sector. of like western rulers, but which could be taken by a working class that was living in the same increasingly living in the same conditions that had produced the bourgeois, and their increased numbers would be enough to have them take power, because if it's bourjois versus workers and they have the same level of cultural sophistication, access to technology and the same like linguistic facility, all this same technological advantages of that had let the the bourgeois rule from a position of minority, if they had those same things plus the numbers, plus all of these newly uh enlightened workers who had been pulled from the ignorance of uh of rural agricultural life that it let this thing go on for so long unchallenged from below really, i mean you'd have cyclical peasant up raisings, but they could never uh really overthrow power, they could only redistribute it a little bit. and then it would be reformed at the top, because they're fucking peasants, they're they're farmers, they did not have the technological capacity to confront the boujoints or the rulers before them, the the feudal aristocrats on their own terms, they needed to have access to the technology, and the marxist vision is the working class would be able to do that, and they made a grab, they grabbed for the controls, but it was a failure, and now that means the... now of course that that makes you think, oh no, that just means the cycle is going to continue, well maybe not if the world is completely destroyed, but i honestly don't think that's going to happen, i think that is what we want to happen the same way we wanted there to be a nuclear war to end all civilization during the cold war cuuse that's a happy ending buse we're not missing anything at the end of the day that's what it is we don't want to miss anything at least i know that's kind of what powers my fear of light fear of death and by because we're we're addicted like our our egos are addicted to sense, they're addicted to pleasure, pleasure of the senses, and that is of course why we are all in a constant state of uh suffering, because we can never have the thing, the actual pleasure, we can only seek a idealized version of it, a capital d desire that can never be fulfilled. and if the world is a smoking crater then we didn't miss anything that's why the ending of don't look up was such a terrible catastrophically bad idea if they really wanted to scare people about global warming because the vision of of total annihilation is a rapturous one, it's why Dr. strange love is a comedy. so that means of course there's going to be a lot of mystery horrible, beyond anything we can say, the slaughter to come, as Cameron Diaz said in the counselor, will be probably be beyond our imagining, because there is there is nothing cruler than a coward, but the earth will endure probably, even if there is a nuclear war as a part of like. permafrost, we're going to turn to Venus and that's the end, there will never be anything else on earth, or before we get to six degrees, political strife on earth leads to a nuclear war that yeah, probably kills all or most humans, but also tamps down that uh that move towards six degrees and refrost that permafrost, and so if that does happen then the thing that can be optimistic about is that if the if this cycle continues, this this thing of sensient beings coming into recognition of one another that is civilization comes that that process begins, the wreckage of what we leave behind is going to be what they sift. to build it, and uh, they will be different people than us, because of that experience, and it's essentially the same, the like the sucker of optimism comes from faith and faith in the faith in that which cannot be seen, because um, everything we see around us, the structures of domination that run our lives and and and the experience of living that... we are compelled into makes us feel like uh, life is uh misery and that there's no point to it, but we're all still alive and we all value things that go beyond that sick desire cycle, and we don't have a name for any of them and they cannot be identified in the fossil record anymore than the evidence of grab grow's uh sort of egalitarian uh autonomous lifestyles uh are left. and like the word love is an easy one uh to use to define this stuff, it's it's sappy, but it's real, that's what art is, art is this is the remnant of that which cannot be uh formalized, cannot be seen, because what it is is it is a feeling below the... to replicate it, which is the same experience as seeing God, you can have the experience, and it will leave an emotional residue, but that residue, as time goes away, as time moves in one direction, entropy moves in one direction, are ability to put any words to it goes away, our ability to communicate in any meaningful way, goes away, which is why esoteric knowledge of the kind that is horded by the shaman of the universe and helped bring about civilization as we know it uh can be generated sort of uh with generated and maintained because you get somebody in an altered state, show, put them through a ritual, and then in the immediate aftermath of that experience that can't be named, can only be felt and is felt as this oneness, this this uh peace, this serenity, this absolute, and this is the important part, absolute certainty, which is something that none of us can have in our moment to moment life, and certainly can never express in any sort of language, and I think depression, a lot, one of the big reasons that we're all depressed as a culture is how few opportunities those feelings we have and so that means all we have is our uncertainty and uncertainty breeds fear and misery and desire and suffering and all that, but there are you can feel ultimate certainty and of course that's what religious fanatics and psychopaths go out and seek and they destroy the world in seeking it, they never find it, if they found it they wouldn't be doing that, but it's that seeking of it, the powers there. actions and we're all seeking it in in self-destructive ways because you can't seek it formally without violating uh our laws of reality, like our understanding of reality as as monads, as unconnected beings bouncing off one another in a in a totally chaotic random uh stew of matter. like yeah, you have no faith without doubt, but the certainty still lives underneath it as a memory. but not as something that can be expressed to others, the closest we have are the symbols of religion and mythology or an attempt to evoke in us the memory of the feeling, and the more successful they are at doing that, the more effective they are as uh as cultural technology, but in a class society we have these symbols that are meant to evoke these feelings and to some extent they still do, but to put to the service of a system that alienates us and makes us miserable and pulls us away from that feeling of certainty, and it's that fundamental schizophrenia that defines life under capitalism, yes, but only because capitalism is the faster and more technologically uh advanced and more uh ecuanically experienced than previous ones, there are more people. on earth and more of them are experiencing life that way, but it's a schizophrenia at the heart of power throughout history, and it it, but it's fell within the power, those with power and those without, because these symbols are to evoke this feeling, and yet our lives are determined by structures that that that insist that that feeling is the lie, that that certainty of unity, that certainty of unity is a lie. It's not sustainable, it can only sustain itself as long as surplus can be extracted to lubricate its creaky wheels to keep the friction to a minimum, and as soon as the lub runs out, the thing starts falling apart, the Roman empire was the first version of this that really dominated uh the the geographic area that would... most amenable to uh technological innovations because of its competitive state framework, but this is why i ultimately don't really see the how why this book is supposed to be blowing everyone's mind politically, because as i said they are correct, there once was a churning sea of human social forms. moving in and out of existence uh with the tides, with with the tides of history and with the uh random randomness of event, but that flow is interrupted by a fixed regime of power, dominating first one geographical area and then extending outward, and then history is these things popping into being like tumors in a fucking liver. and then growing like the malignancies that they are. It's a very fun book, I'm having a lot of fun with it and and I'm I'm actually glad for all the cool information, like I really do, this has helped me think about history significantly, like this stuff about like you know the global flow, that's really useful, but as a political thing, which they're trying to emphasize, i get it, they're trying, they're saying, you can live collectively with all of the uh cultural stuff, all the things we think of as necessary for for a real like meaningful civilization, the things that make us reflect on our oneness, but allow us to enjoy our separateness, this is basically what he's hoping for, and what uh Marx was seeking to create on earth, and what is the end point of all human civilizations, or the the the imagined end point, regardless of what they're actually creating. a situation where yes, there is uh enough freedom to allow us to live not in fear of one another and enjoy the separateness of each other, enjoy our variance, enjoy the randomness that our temporary appearance gives us, but to recognize... that we are not separate, but different faces of one another, that is to live without fear, that is to live without doubt, and arguing that you can have that, of course, not perfect, people are not going to feel that way all the time, there's miseries of life, life is suffering and pain, but there's going to be a baseline that maintains a homeostasis that minimizes things like ger violence, warfare, ritual sacrifice and class conflict born out of alienation. because there will not be that fundamental uh schizophrenic break between the symbols as we are to observe them as they are propagated by those in power and as it is and what it is like to live under them, but once these tumors start popping up because of changing uh ecological conditions and people responding to them at different points until somebody responds to them in a way that gives them a competitive advantage because it reduces a degree of inefficiency that allows for decisions to be made quicker for uh for social alienation to be directed inward or directed outward and pointed at an enemy as opposed to staying inward and undermining uh from the social body and then it starts gobbling up all those egalitarian areas behind besides them like they've described several times how in Mesopotamia you had this relatively egalitarian uh settled urban culture in ur and then on the peripheries of its trade network these heroic kingdoms, people who basically were like, this stuff is gay, like i'm a big strong guy, i don't want to have to listen to these people and do what they want to do, i want to go out and kill people, i got a lot of testosterone flowing and i could and if i fight i know win, or at least I have a strong belief that I'll win, unlike the fucking nerds in there, like no, I don't want to fight, I might die, and they go out on the periphery, and they create these warrior cultures that under conditions of ecological flux allow force to be employed in a way that decapitates these egalitarian cities and takes them over from outside. and that does seem to be what happened in Mesopotamia, you have like they've talked about how like the the the council structure that they had before the king showed up persisted after the kings took over and the day-to-day life of Urians uh of was not that much disrupted disrupted. by having a king uh, but of course over time that changed and that power wrenched downward throughout the social order as stresses accumulated, as other empires emerged that copied them in order to fight with them. so they have a thing in here where they describe how bureaucracy actually emerged uh, not to facilitate. domination, but to actually uh facilitate agalitarian distribution of resources, a little village in uh Syria where 6200 BC, a fire happened that that fixed this community, this clay uh structures and baked them, and we have what have we got, what do we know, we got a little village, equal sized houses and a central store room and a symbolic, a collection of like symbolic tokens used to keep track of distribution of resources, so this is and no king, no power, so boom, we got bureaucracy to facilitate egalitarianism, similarly, there's a system in in Peru, the iulu system of distribution of resources in a community to make sure that everybody has land and that nobody gets too much power, no too much money, where it's all debts that are accumulated. over a period of time uh the technology like these notted bits of string that were used to to count and and and and record keep were all like loosened out at the end of the year in order to keep everybody square uh which is sometimes associated with the incan uh kings but which preceeded them and was then taken by those kings just as in Mesopotamia those bureaucratic structures are now taken over to impose it equality as in we're all equal as uh subject we're all equally subject to the king but with the demands that that comes with being equalized as well like look the king demands x from everybody you're all the same but of course everybody isn't the same and what those systems like the iUL system would do is recognize difference oh this guy's got a broken leg he can't uh bring me as much he can't produce as much crops you know there's there's someone sick here okay so we have to redistribute the labor and we will redistribute it collectively so we have the people who can be subject to violence, are written out of the contract, because we've imposed equality through bureaucracy, but one design to dominate, and it's like, once again, I think that's a very elegant, structure that is could persuasive to me as to how that happens, but again, it pretty much always happens in that direction, over time is that the warrior cast society that is able to create... uh an aristocracy of physically powerful uh and militarily skilled warriors who work perhaps with a priestly class, but who over and dominate the priestly class, because even the priests think that these guys are gods because of their power, because of how awesome they are, and what they've seen them do, what they've seen them do, they're going to be able to exercise. violence much more effectively than your fucking little community garden uh coops and then they decapitate you and they take over and eventually use all of your structures to their ends. so this is we get to the end of the chapter uh and they they conclude states emerged not out of inevitable processes of evolution but through happen stands and that play kingdoms become real ritual structures that are meant to be temporary get elongated into permanence, but the civilization pre-exist states, and they end with the description of Mino and Creet, which very well might have had a theocratic form of government where like priestesses, female priestesses ruled over men, like the island in the nick cage version of wickerman, and they basic they use this just to point out that even though you have all this physical evidence, yeah they had some sort of democratic uh like witches coven running over them uh, nobody in archaeology will call it that because they just have refused to believe it could exist. well, look at, imagine how much that uh, the regime of discrimination, like refusal to say take evidence at face value, uh, the app the application of like a rigor a riger that would never exist in to that they would never extend to anything that affirmed their believes, uh, imagine how that shapes all of our understanding of history, and it's like, yes, correct, once again, I think they've made their their argument very persuasively, and at this level, I'm I'm ready to say, it makes sense to me, so I'm going to believe it, because that's all I can end up going with, but again, my big takeaway is that they make no argument, yet, there's one chapter in the conclusion left, that uh, for like anarch'. in the now and here and horizontalism in the now and here that um that deals with my central problem, which is what we've shown pretty conclusively in this book is that the inefficiency, which is a virtue, the social virtue if you want to keep something stable and long-lasting in isolation, that inefficiency of decision making is a virtue, it allows you to have bureaucracy. and uh uh and it allows you to have uh priest warrior classes and allows you to have uh sovereigns and and without feeling like you're being exploited, it allows you to do that, but again that's only in a stable state, but the stable state is not possible in the uh, in a condition where humans are coming into contact with each other and recognizing strangers and not friends. which is the definition of all interactions between humans once you get past a certain degree of human uh of of a certain level of human civil human population, not within a group, which is what they do a good job of undermining, but collectively, how many people there are on the earth, and eventually they start bouncing into each other and bumping into each other, and once they do, they're going to adapt to that reality where they'... can't go somewhere else and maintain their level of inefficiency of structures where they have to stand, and if they have to stand, then they have to change their structures and what's going to have to go is all of this glorious inefficiency, all these areas for consensus and uh and response to the land and each other, recognition, it has to be hierarchicalized. now the the marxist teleological dream, the culmination of like the... human experience that we're all yearning for is for the regime of technological administration that we have developed that is absolutely capable of of providing one on earth, not in equal conditions, but in conditions of minimal alienation, this is what i mean, not equal conditions, and they would agree, equality is means nothing really if you don't have uh basic buying into the social structure you're part of, we have we could turn this, it might be too late now, i mean it is too late now with what we have, but like during the 20th century, when there were still hinge points of real uh contingency in the... battle between the working class and bourgeois that characterized the 20th century, if things had broken a little different, and and here's another part of the thing that makes me optimistic fundamentally, in another world they did, in another version of earth, they absolutely did, a version of earth that is as real as ours, they did, that where the feelings and the blood and the and the sweat and the toil and and the grandure and the... the aesthetic heights and and the all of the the the beautiful like marbled uh experiences that every all the billions of people on this planet have felt have been felt there too that the working class directing this administrative alienated technological state could create could take that technology and put it to the work of creating a unequal, and then the thing is, it wouldn't stay unequal, right? like, it's not like, oh, you're telling me that all the people in Africa who live in like uh, absolute poverty are going to just stay in absolute poverty, but be happy about it now, no, because there will be a project of alleviating that poverty. alleviating that, that poverty will be a collective goal accepted by every structure of human civilization and move towards, which means surpluss being moved from one part of the structure to another. from one geographic area to another, but those people in the middle, not being dispossessed, not feeling like they're losing anything, because without the need to affirm hierarchy through surplus, the but still, this is crucial, able to enjoy difference, but do it ritually, enjoy difference ritually, and also in the performance of... a act, a heroic collective act of pulling people out of misery and poverty, and then once you get there, what's next? there's a reason that the Soviets set the fucking uh terms of competition between the United States and the Soviet Union on space exploration. We would never have gone to the moon without the Soviets. We might be going there now, but only as a last gasped effort to find value somewhere else and human civilization as it becomes untenable on earth. we went to the soviets because the soviets understood like once you've created a a a peaceful, once you have created a a social order that allows everyone to work in one in one towards one goal using the technology that the concentration of capitalism has allowed to uh to be birthd into being, all that misery, all that human misery created these things that can then be used, now that was the marxist vision, i would argue that that's also the anarchist vision, because like even when they say there's no authority, it's like well they still what, it's a bunch of collectives, but those collectives make decisions and they're making decisions with by definition this like increased technological capacity that is being used towards the social end of pacifying violence between people, so that means even your anarchist communal horizontalism would bring about this condition of a general level of minimal uh sustenance, safety, certainty of safety, you go to the fucking stars, you could literally go to the uh conquer, not conquer. but explore and touch and reflect on oneself throughout the galaxy and we basically forced the the we the soviets basically forced the United States to create some sort of uh vision for uh for interstellar travel that like there's a reason that all those like America buffers like Tom Hanks fixate on the space program because it was our it was our best vision but of course in America. It was a crime to do that. White he's on the moon. To do that, to go to the moon when you have so much misery in your own country, makes that country look like a joke and a... and and sadism to everyone within it. going to the moon then when there isn't anybody who feels that way. again, not that they might not be suffering, of course, they're suffering, everyone's suffering, but that they don't attribute their suffering to the state, they don't attribute their suffering to society. they're able to deal with it on its own terms because they are not alienated from it. again, some people are, there's always misfits, there is always outcasts, there's always people who can't function, but instead of now where the misfits and outcasts are people who literally want to feel. uh, it'll be people who like were traumatized individually and like we're the product of legacies of trauma that are still going to echo into the future, even if we ever got to that level of social sophistication, and they could be dealt with on that level, that is the the horizon of like prison abolition is that people who are misfits can be identified as such and brought back in, and those who don't can't be reconciled are such a small fat percentage of the population that you don't need permanent structures of domination. to keep them away or to scare people away from being them, so this is the universal horizon, it's the only horizon we can have, it's the horizon, we're not going to get now without a collapse, and which we probably as he like, i mean like, this could literally be a project of the squids in a hundred thousand years, whatever, whoever does it, that is, that is the geist coming into full recognition of itself, and what it requires? is the awareness and recognition that any structure of power that the liberatory collection of people, most of them by definition workers, but not all, could put together, would by definition have to have structures of efficiency of action equal to, the forces that they would come into conflict with, because if they don't, they will be defeated, which is why every great historical anarchist fable ends in destruction, be it uh, be it anarchist Catalonia or Nester Manco's Ukraine, they all get stomped. So that is why I think this is both a great book, but from the point of view of what the authors wanted, a failure, because the end of the day they cannot really as anarchists really ground. their analysis materially, every time they try to, you can see them in the book doing this, they start resisting, because you iky materialism, you're going to start telling me that I'm not a free being, you're going to start telling me that I my my actions have been uh predetermined by material factors, gross icky, no thank you, instead of moving through that, working through that liberal, frankly juvenile objection, and then coming out the... the end of it, go through the fucking tunnel and come to the to the the the pillar and do not be afraid, but no, you got to run away from it, you, no, you're saying I'm not a free being, uh-uh, no materialism for me, so that means like when they're talking about, you know, uh, they're they're glorying in the the glorious, they're glorying in the inefficiency and the freedom of these uh structures. They never consider what allows that to persist materially, they just take it for granted, and what they do not recognize is that a social structure that can make decisions through administrative structures that depend on unquestioned hierarchy, as opposed to having to establish legitimacy and time and order is placed can do things in a way that allows them to harness the technological weapons of society and then direct them towards the domination of others with all of the misery that it is caused internally facilitating it by being directed outward, i mean it's it's astounding, it's an astounding machine, and there's a reason that it won, there's a reason it took over it. and there's a reason the only thing they could defeat it is a self-conscious state structure, not necessarily any of the states we have now, like the United States, LOL, no. but in terms of something that has all three of those things that he talked about, but where instead of being concentrated in a sovereign uh, that is above us, a sovereign that is within us, and that can only be facilitated, that feeling of a sovereign that is within us and is us, but is also... separate from us, that's only possible through humans going through a a process of alienation from the world that becomes terminal, which is where we are now, we are terminally alienated from the world around us, we are terminally selfish in a way that is not stable, the only next step, the only thing after that is either complete annihilation, as I said, possible, but but not inevitable, and not likely honestly, or the final realization of that neurotic separateness, which is a refixation, a re-enlargement, a a a a spiritual big bang that reinscribes us as part of a collective, and that allows us to participate in hierarchical structures without being dominated by them able to utilize bureaucracy and administrative administration and and exploit separation of labor at least temporarily until the degree of technology is sufficient that the amount of labor doesn't have to really suck star trek future see like in under capitalism if you're this is one reason i people can't imagine what socialism would really look like, like post scarcy socialism, buse under capitalism, yeah, if you don't have anything to do, you go crazy, if you don't have a job that is uh productive in some way, it turns your brain into mush, because you're not engaged in anything meaningful, because you can't make meaning, and as an ideologized subject of capitalism, that's what you want, but in the post sc communism that idleness is where we work, where we work, and of course that's something that probably will never happen, that's once again a fantasy horizon that keeps you on the treadmill, but what will exist is a place where the the actual pain, the actual alienation of uh of carrying out. like a divided labor, although labor division should be minimized as much as possible, where they have to exist, minimized in such a way that that it's absorbable by the social fabric around it, which is not what we have now, all everything, every alienation is shooted outward into into misery that we feel that we then express to the people around us and it dissolves the social fucking foundations from within, i mean we're in the middle of that right now we can't see that all around us and yet we're we're we're part of it and then we're also seeing it and revolted by it and the more we're revolted by it the more we we engage in it it's it's a it's a doom cycle but like for example say there's no technology that's going to make it so that somebody doesn't have to uh you know go into a sub to the sewers and like fix something or you deal with shit deal with gross stuff, have to do something like with your body that is painful or unpleasant, somebody could do that job, but somebody could do that job for like two hours a week, as opposed to being compensated in money they can then use to to buy things that come at the expense of others and that just drown the misery and by expense. you just do anything you want, which will be constructive by definition, it will be constructive in one way or another, it will be, it will be constitutive, it will be constitutive of human of social life and therefore will be positive, and some of it is going to be fucking astrophysics, because people are still going to want to answer those questions, and they're still going to have the capacity to do it, they're going to have more technological access than ever to try to pursue those questions, everything that we do now, is productive, like meaningfully, socially productive, will still be carried out because the desire to express that feeling of... connection, love to each other is still going to exist, but some people are going to want to express that love by finding out if there's other uh species in the universe, or if you can you know see God, and if you've conquered matter, you can do that until everything possible that could... happen has and every version of redemption and rapture and and revival that any of any human uh uh symbolic order has ever uh believed in can be can happen so yeah we're all we're all going to rise again we're all going to meet each other in the great by and by and knowing that. makes a lot easier to deal with the the real misery of of living in the black iron prison that we are in. so yeah, i got to say uh, yeah, grab grow, valiant effort uh, and I think they really do believe that they're dismantling uh marxism in some way with this or providing an alternative non-marxistt egalitarian uh uh social history to to rival the marxist one but uh sorry swinging a miss because it because it cannot be materialist it cannot be truly metaphysical and it cannot really reckon with the alchemchemical transformation that goes on when a society uh breaks into classes and creates uh rituals around the perpetuation of them, and then it makes a new type of person, I've talked about this with this book before, and that you can't go back, you can only move through, and that means that you have to grapple with the uh, the institutional and technological consequences of those transformations, well they, anthropologi has a non-marxist class analysis, but it's it's academic, this they want to make this into like a popular alternative to marxism, and look how big it is, and they're talking about apparently like before he died, grab was talking to grab grow about about to waingrow, waiengrow, he that would be funny if this was graber and waiengrow, the guy from heat, um, he about this kevin, it's a grab girl, but they want like they were going to do like a whole series with this, like that, it was going to be like this, a debt like... some other books and the they were trying to do like an alternative to uh capital based on anthropology here, but while I think it does provide a real moving and plausible uh analysis of that of of what human uh society uh looked like before reaching a... uh, a population threshhold, and this is the important thing, grab grow are trying to take that on, explicitly say, no, it's not a function of population, and I think what they're doing with the book and they're doing a good job of it is saying, yes, not within population of a given group, but once you get enough people so that they're bumping into each other as strangers. It creates pressures on these forms that push them and extrude them in one direction and that we've been living in the consequence of that ever since. Okay, so there we go, that's chapter 10. Next week, we're wrapping up here, this is the last uh formal chapter is chapter 11, ha, ends on chapter 11, how many chapters does Det have because if it's 11 that'd be pretty funny uh, on the historical foundations of the indigenous critique, oh I'm sorry, it's full circle, so we're going to go back to the indigenous critique of uh, civilization that began the book and and and finish bricking up their monument to uh the the ecstatic. wonder of of matriarchal uh consensus society, that has 12 chapters, oh man, swing in a miss. and then there's a conclusion, i think i'll probably do the conclusion because you know to wrap the whole thing up will be nice with it's own episode uh so two more of these and then maybe like after that i'll do like a a Q&A or something before we figure out the next book if anyone has any suggestions please let me know because i'm going to need another one after this all right talk to you guys later bye
