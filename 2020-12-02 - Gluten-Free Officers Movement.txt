 She think loves the dog, she thanks lass a dog on fire. Herly burly by man, that's a good song, I always thought that would be good uh, at bat music, I said that I wanted my uh, my hipster ass baseball closing pitching music to be 2 + 2 = 5 by radio head. but I think even more obnoxious would be doing a man man song as my bat b music uh for officer for a free officer's movement in america my kingdom for Jerry Rawlings oh man talked before about how like you know in a context of of unvail of uh of of com compounding crises, like if we assume that uh there isn't really a respit after covid, if if the next step after covid is an intensification rather than a remitting, a relapsing and remitting uh uh uh emiseration, which I think is unlikely but possible, then you got to throw politics out the window entirely, the only hope we have to to like stop the skid off of the end of the mountain and into the abis of just to... atomized uh uh techno overlordship is going to be the us military. i mean, no joke. not of course the monsters at the top of it, not those joint shesus staff who are mostly monstrous because of their banality. i mean, these are all just ikmens. they're allmens, not in the sense that they did as great evil as Ichmen did, even though of course they're perpetuating militarily, the great blood fountain of American empire, which has a massive fucking body count itself. they arement in their way that they approach their uh butchers lives is with a total blank banality, it is time service, it isn't even like you could say about a figure like Hitler, it isn't even some expression of a mad will to power that is at least connected to a human spiritual yearning, even if it's corrupted and monstrous, they are merely punching a clock in the service of of a of misery, i mean the only. reason there able to do it is because they've been abstracted from the process, likeman was in his little room with his little typewriter, same way these guys are in their little centrs looking through their fucking uh night vision goggle shots of exploding weddings, you think the how many military males we got in there? oh it was a good uh 30 to 45, well there we go, good job guys, we have now reduced that number of terrorists because as we all know the number of terrorists is fixed. and therefore the job of fighting terrorism is just killing them until they're all gone, that's how it works right, so they tell themselves as they punch the clock, they're never going to stop anything from happening, they'll become amazon generals, they'll they'll just get inducted into the vezos like Peter Teil division and they won't even think about it, traditionally where there has been uh, not not socialist, not marxist but at least progressive and like broadly, i don't know, humanitarian, populist sentiment within the military, it has come from its middle ranks, uh, it is all of all of the non non like of all the military regimes of all the cou imposed regimes uh of the 20th century uh, all the ones that were not strictly reactionary, like strictly existed to serve the interest of of the... most retrangient uh uh um faction of like the the national bourgeois, like your Pinaches, uh, the ones whose whose regimes did not just become like authoritarian uh imposition of neoliberalism, they all uh occurred because middle level officers, like lieutenants, often captains, sometimes colnels, very, very rarely generals get together and because a lot of them come from working class backgrounds, you know, they're not, the military is broadly egalitarian in its uh, in its, in fact it's disproportionately weighted now in our military specific. and generally in history, it's disproportionately weighted towards poor people in terms of the number of people who make it up because of the need to uh buse you need numbers, you need cannon ftter and those aren't going to come from people with money, if you're in the if you have money, if you have position, if you have status and you're going into the military, it's in exchange for a shiny shiny sword and a beautiful red uniform and a guarantee that you'll never have to do a fucking push-up in your life, you get to ride around in a fancy. horse and sip sit and sip tea and order other people to their debts, or maybe charge along them grandly, but from the front so that your debt is part of a grand narrative that their deaths can never be, one way or another uh you want rank and therefore you're a reactionary, and so the top levels of the military will always end up selecting for that, in the middle rank you have some upstarts, you have some people came from the bottom, started from the bottom now the here, or maybe from the restive and always and always liminal middle class. and then you encounter army, military organization, military is free to core, military education, which is going to be broadly liberal in a way that's going to conflict with the uh, you know, if you have a nationalist conception which you have to, if that nationalism goes beyond these narrow ruling cleak, which is more likely to happen if you come from the bottom part of it, all of a sudden that national concept is not strictly reactionary, and so where is this happening? free officers movement in uh Egypt, NASA of course uh, I mean no matter where they ended up and how degraded they end up, the bath revolutions in Iraq and uh uh Syria um and also Khaddafi, which by the way, Qaddafi, I don't think is a great man, I think that you know he he belongs among the pantheon of bies who are able to stand up to America, and you kind of have to give all those guys credit, and you have to respect them just because of how difficult that was, uh, but uh, and you know he wasn't he did not uh fully sign up, he was always playing a double game and until it stopped working for him, and he did forever, and another thing I respect about the motherfucker, he uh, he never promoted himself to general, the guy was a cornel when they took power, when the green movement that he was ahead of took power, and then he was in charge for 40 years and he never promoted himself to general, he was always uh colnel and I respect that, humble. um who else uh the fucking i mean the most like the most like explicitly left-wing movement actually had the support of a number of actual communists and i'm referring here to the carnation revolution in 1974 in Portugal when when young officers some of whom were you just liberals some of were disenchanted conservatives everybody was sick of the estado novo the decrepid salazar uh sort of uh uh corporates like protofascist I guess uh government that had ruled since the 20s uh before Franko uh came up the ghost uh and there was an attempt to maintain the estado novo and to in fact and to maintain more importantly the colonial brush fire wars that Portugal was fighting to maintain their territory in Angola and Mozambique where Portuguese boys were going to fight and die including the friends of these officers and they came together and with their educations and their experiences and said holy. shit, you know, we have a chance here, and they carried off something that could have tipped into a like a military led communist uh overthrow there, it didn't, because the the weight of like the the the center of gravity was not with the communists in Portugal, it was, it was with the left more broadly, which means that it would eventually settle more towards liberalism, which in the context of the heart of cour Europe, it's hard to argue, would have really had any other way of going, and you know the early communist league. years of the cardashian revolution ended up kind of regretting what happened because it did you know it ended withport, but now here in this crisis moment when everyone's turning to shit and everything is turning, we're just getting either like the iron boot of biden bidenist, macronist, mercellian thought, like the global just the the jackboot of of of naked uh neoliberalism or just the incoherent uh uh react. dog-brained populism, the spectaclized uh um fantasy politics of Bolsonaro and Trump and fucking Orban and all these motherf all these main case all these marginets, where is the place where those are the dominant tendencies? Portugal is one, and you can say that Portugal's left-wing government has made compromises and is undermining you know some broad uh left movement internationally such that it exists, but I would argue that in the context of where you could be, and uh in the current moment where your government could be in response to dealing with this COVID crisis and the way it's reshaping the economy uh and way of life, I would rather be in Portugal and they had one. those uh uh colnels movements, chavez began his rise to power with an attempted coup before he took that the uh like the position that having struck that blow and created that creadacore for for freedom, people gravitated towards, problem is the United States military, our our thing is almost designed to squeeed. please out anyone with any capacity if not you know for for left-wing sentiment because I'm sure there's plenty of broad liberals in the in the young officer course some of whom could could if conditions deteriorate and they're forced to make you know more stark choices about choosing between profit and human life, they might choose human life, they might choose socialism or barbarism as the choice becomes more clear, but even if they wanted to, they have no initiative or ability. the their job is to push the buttons in this giant wheezing machinery of of war where winning is not the point of it. this is one of the first military, this is a very rare thing in a military where it is designed to not do the thing that it's supposed to be functioning for. like when you go into the military, it is, you're taught that the role of the military is to win wars, but the actual role of the US military is to fight wars and those are two different things and having to that lie, it's unsustainable, and i mean i uh, i don't know how many people who find themselves like tending towards humanity and towards socialism and away from capitalism and barbarism, they might just get turfed out before they have a chance to get even to the fucking junior officers level, but i have said that is speculation, i have very little familiarity with the military, i'm a soft fancy college boy, i didn't go to, i didn't go, when i'm from, it really does come down to a lot of cases, you go to military. or you go to college, that's that's the the choice in like uh, yeah, manadawak, which is like a a a fly spec mini d rust belt town that had been a um a maritime hub, uh, it's actually where half of the submarine fleet was built during world war ii, the other half was built in Pennsylvania, and there's a sub USA, you can go and visit in mano, and they had a big uh, uh, they created, they, I think they still make the the uh, the manaduak uh, cranes, i think uh, but there was like a pot and pan factory and it was all going away as i was coming up there as i was like coming into awareness because i really was born with the neoliberal era there in the early 80s and so i was uh seeing it all fall apart before my eyes and so by the time i get out of i got out of high school like if you go to the military unless you want to stick around in like huff glue or you could work or you work at a farm with your family and you want to do that you know and there were farm people around there, it's all surrounded by farm women uh, or you uh, you had to go to college or the military, those are your options, and because of what my experience of life had led me to, weird quirks of biology and experience, i mean the fucking uh back injury being one of them that would have disqualified me even if nothing else had, although honestly i don't think i could have joined the military if i wanted to, i'm deaf in one ear, i don't think i think i wouldn't have even like i wouldn't have been drafted in war one world war 2, i would have been 4f with the head cuuse like i hear that people got denied uh service in world war 2 which was not something people really doged like you really wanted to fight because it was so socially expected uh but people like not getting it because of fucking flat feet and i'm like god damn i literally can't hear out of half of my head i bet they would not have let me in even then but anyway so but then like even if i've been ablebodied and and and whatever my temperament my experience. my interests, my social self, sense of self was not really compatible with the military, it did not appeal to me, so hey, college, get some solarships, take out some money, see what happens there, and I made that choice, but there are those who go through the officer core, which is essentially the college of the military branch, that's the college of the military. like vector there, and then you come out of that and you've got a bunch of ideas, you know, you've assimilated some, you can you rejected others, you have some sort of sense of self politically, even if you think you don't, because a lot of those guys that love to think that they're a political, but of course that's also a political position, one way or another they are thoroughly political, they are political politicized, which means they're encountering this moment of crisis at deprivation is in the same way we are, how will people respond as things get worse, and that's what i said, if the if the slide is intense, i don't think there's enough time for us to build up the infrastructure to resist it at a class level as a working class movement to withdraw work in a strategic way in order to to reduce the system's ability to function so that some sort of confrontation has to come to be had with capitalism uh like i say this is all presposing one trajectory uh in that case i think we got to just we got to be hopeful that that uh cast exists somewhere but like i said that is the less likely outcome but you know that's got to be something that people think about and you know keep stirring in the pot there when they think about things long term is the military because it is like the biggest only trusted non-partisan institution in this country, like we've talked about how we're in the among the politicized of us, we're creating a new but dichotomy between, i mean two groups of people who live in alternative realities, not just to the point where they think different things uh, but that they essentially uh pay humage to the authority of only things that they're choosing, and in that case you really don't have any institution that can be ever ever hope to tame really. out of control social uh violence or even just uh rapid decline of you know coherence of an economy civil order but yeah as I'm speculating on a hypothesis but certainly does complicated. the way a lot of people like to on the left, people who style themselves leftists like to think about the military, like yes it is - it is an agent of doom, it is our worldwide uh, it's it's what rends the sinues of the earth for us, but the people within it have to be understood to be in roughly the same relationship personally and culpability-wise to the real exercise of of this machinery as plenty of people who you would call comrade within the United States. and so that's uh why you know it just things always need to be more nuanced but we always just drive towards oppositions and Bernie did have the most military donors and also as Fredrick Jamison has pointed out the U.S. military is one of the few places where you actually live in some semblance of a social democracy in this. country, you know, obviously it's threadbear and getting worse over time because cuts everywhere austerity everywhere, but you go, you go into unlike any other place in American life, if you decide to go to college or you decide to like learn a trade or or try to you know hustle or whatever the hell you're trying to do uh in in the in the wage economy, if you join the military you are guaranteed certain things like housing like healthcare in exchange for a civic and your duty, that's actually how those are that's that's the social order that would like hypothetically create a uh and sustain a social democracy or challenge capitalism coherently, but of course the argument here is, well none of this is going to lead to socialism or a socialist revolution, obviously not. obviously not, what it might do is stop, not stop, of course, but slow, change the trajectory of, reduce the intensification of the process of full atomization and and uh and uh social dissolution and spiritual dissolution and literal physical dissolution that is occurring under this crisis ridden, death spiraling neoliberalism, and then maybe in in that context you can work from there, it's easier to work in a room that's not filling with water, it's easier to do a crossword puzzle if fucking xyclon b isn't coming in through the fucking vents. so yeah, none of this is is prescriptive beyond that, it's like, what about uh, you know, should you people be joining the military, I don't know, these are all decisions people have to make on themselves, but I do know that uh, that the the totalizing work of of defining yourself online through having a rigid approach to reduced binary questions. is is how is is a recipe for someone who cannot engage the world around them uh uh positively cannot is not likely to create the feedback loop that that produces a positively charged social interaction that can actually sustain itself, but yeah I would not, I mean I obviously even if I could I would not have joined the military ever, I couldn't imagine myself. doing any of that uh, even if I wasn't even if I was guaranteed I wouldn't be in a theater of war, but the thing is you can't guarantee that and that is the big reality that underscores all of this, and it lends such like real um emotion, charged feeling to the question of a militarian society, because while we're talking about this, it's killing people, while we're speaking, it's killing people, I mean in every sense, not only is it a machinery of death, not only does it by its name by its very existence rob American citizens and citizens globally of well-being and and wealth and health and possibility to thrive. uh, it's act also the single largest corporate uh climate emitter in the world. it's killing us at every level, that's bad. it makes sense that people want to make this a like at the signal issue, and then there's a question of solidarity. how do you can you say that you have solidarity with? with the victims of empire if you're conspiring with the perpetrators of the violence of empire, which I say, that is the, I mean, that's the contradiction at the heart of organizing in the imperial core, but it's unresolvable, and the reason people love arguing about it is because it's unresolvable, because it will always lead to more arguing. veterans i think - would be a ver, and and the thing about... and this is a reason i don't think that we're going to get to anything with the democrats and republicans, i feel like at this point the brand of the democrats has been so spoiled among I would say veterans as a category broadly, certainly white veterans and of course that's racism is a reason for that, but a lot of it is unnecessary, a lot of it is around charged vacant political theater that doesn't actually resolve to have anything to do with the parties themselves, like everybody can point out tediously that the actually democrats give more money to the military and they give more money to va offers and they their policies would help veterans, yeah, sure, but that's not how it's experienced, it's experience is a cultural slugfest between performances of value, the democratic performance of value is even if like joe biden and those guys, the political and that means that the thing that's going to come up, the thing that's going to catch among us, if it's going to, is going to come in the form eventually, eventually, probably of some sort of party formation, and it will be outside of that dynamic, because that's the only way that you could breach the the the hall of like a labor and political movement uh onto one that people are aware of in the media sphere and then one into which people are moving towards elsewhere, the generation of political momentum, you're not going to have uh that if you have to deal with a lot of the shit about democrats and culture stuff, and also if you're if you're a post left, you wants the republicans to do it, it means the republicans can't do it either, because the republicans are the party of racism, the republicans are the party of... of hatred of minorities and fucking immigrants and hostility to women as equal citizens, that's not going anywhere either, so nobody's working class person, no matter where they are demographically is going to be able to adhere to one of these parties uh enough to get a broad swath of working class people that operate from a working class perspective because they're alienating the other half. and you need one of those haves to get with the people who aren't part of this bullshit or parts of both of them, more likely parts of both of them, and that's by something that isn't tainted with these garbage, with this shit, and you can say, but it's not fair that the democrats aren't the part, are considered not the to hate troops, and it is fair that the republicans are racist, that doesn't matter. Yeah, you don't want to talk about a third way because that's, I mean, that was originally fascism, and if you talk about the military part, people hairs are really going to get back in the heads about fascism, and then of course it was the you, neoliberal neofascism of the current uh, the current trajectory, either way, no, thank you, but uh, that only makes sense if you think that the two ways we have now are like a left and right, they're not, it's actually more of a second way. like the current way is one way, it's one big thing, nothing is going to change, it's locked, the gears are frozen, we're tumbling off of the end of the thing, politics is dead within this structure, so anything that comes outside of it is an alternative to that, so it's a second way, I e socialism, buse fascism. was a third way in a real contest between capital and labor, it was, it was a real donny Brook, those comes looked like they had, they had old uh richle penny bags on the run for a minute there until fascism showed up to save capitalism's ass, that is not we're the situation we're in right now, we're on where politics has become a a uh trump low, it's it's a fucking an illusion and we're we're fixated by it while uh the actual politics is fixed. the Chinese are tweeting about Australian war crimes, they have entered the game, folks, China is entered the mind space, they are going to try to weaponize human rights just like we do, it is going to be delightful, oh man, seeing people tie themselves into contortions to try to outwoke one another in their uh just of bloodshed because of course all of this talk about human rights is strictly for the egg heads, it's strictly for the dumpian assholes, no one else is listening to that or cares, so that means the language will get more and more horrifyingly grotesquely uh uh diversity uh infused. Yeah, my real dream is, you know, I said it's going to come down to China versus uh, America, well how about a couple of officers movements, high fiving in the middle, what about that, to get rid of the like the top at the the the top and corporate merger or confrontation, how about one of those, huh? how likely is it? no, not very, but the good news is if you think. about it, nothing is likely, because none of these, there's so many probabilities, and none of them mean anything until they've resolved into one state or another, which means you can't look at anything until it's already happened, and that the whole thing of likely or unlikely is much less important than understanding the greater structures, it's not whether your predictions are good or not, it's about whether you feel like you are grounded in your analysis and then you can extend it for a bit, but the further you extend the fucking misstier. gets because contingencies pile up upon one another and render every subsequent moment just uh vastly more difficult to calculate because of the amount of randomness involved, the cat is neither dead nor alive, the cat the cat is floating through like we all are, like i talked about how the election was sort of a opening of the box, and i think it was an opening of the box for one thing, but it only opened the box on that. that thing, now we got to deal with that that's a dead cat, okay, but there's a bunch of other cats here, there's a bunch of other boxes, none of them have been opened yet, and all we can really tell by that bit box is maybe looking which direction we're likely to see the next box, grasping in in in broad strokes, not through, i mean and of course this is what i'm talking about like at the level of theory, the good news is while people talk like this, well people are operating at this level, people are operating at the level of technology, people are operating at the level of personal engagement, the movement being built as I speak, the contours of which are coming into view, what it is, I don't know, no one even knows they're part of it, and no one will until it's already happened, so if you want to say there's no hope that nothing can be good, that doom is inevitable, well honestly that doesn't really change anything. because you're still gonna be living a life, you're still going to have people you love, unless you're just going to kill yourself, which you're not going to do, you're going to live your life, you're gonna have people in your life that you love. you're going to try to make your their life better, the more you love the people around you, the more you're people you're going to love, the more you're going to care about them, which means the more likely you are, when a situation comes where you can all help each other, you do it, and then you're doing it and you're moving towards the same goal as somebody who has the perfect outline in their head and never lost faith and never took the black goal, you're going to end up doing the same thing, doesn't matter what got you there intellectually. that's all that's that's just following after your heart pulling you in a direction your heart pulling you gravitationally towards other hearts and like that is just to say like it's fun to talk about this stuff and it should inform you your life one way or the other it's stuff to talk about thing people need things to talk about people need things to think about and things that help that makes sense of the world are better than things that make the world more murky and make them more angry and make them more scared because they understand it less, like those things have help, they have benefit, but they cannot be the thing that makes you act, they can't be, because you will just be missing the forest for the picture of the trees. You know, I realize that there is something to that old that horrible saying that people uh that love to who want to avoid uh any kind of account, any sort, they want to do politics purely for cloud and have no interest in actually changing anyone, the old the old anyone's mind are making the world better, that is the old, it's not my job to educate. thank you, thank, and that is obviously incredibly cynical when used, and it is used specifically so that people can get out of justifying their beliefs, because one, it's it's hard, two, it's frustrating, uh, ei, not fun, and three, it's actually impossible for some of them because they don't even know why they believe what they believe, because deep down, they're operating off the social signals and they haven't reason to that point, so if they get into an argument or they get into a thing where they have to educate, they might run out of knowledge, and they can't run out of knowledge publicly without undermining their position and status, they always have the bluff that they know more, that is essentially a call of a bluff, they if they don't have to they won't, since they can just say that and that lets them opt out, but i think one thing that makes people say that that isn't just craven and isn't purely just about cloud is the fact that uh there is something to it if you extend it to, it's not my job to educate me you about everything, and that's the big problem with one of the big problems with this online thing is that everybody is operating off the premise that they have to be a fucking expert on everything, they have to be at comment on everything uh, and so when they're asked, why do you believe this, they might not really know, but also it might not matter that they don't know, because it's not really their job in life, it's not what they know about, it's not what they can communicate, there is something they do know and can communicate. and if you ask them about that, they'd be able to, they would want to answer you, because they would be happy to share, but nobody, nobody is in that position, everyone is the position of trying to bluff each other around knowing, that's why a lot of the questions end up, the the things people are supposed to educate you about, end up just being like contested sides of an argument rather than any useful uh insight, uh, because uh, that's all you're really trying to do is tell somebody the right side of an argument to take, not any practical application to your life, so everybody shouldn't be fucking answering every question about every goddamn thing, maybe when you know something about something, say it, and of course I know easy, like that's hilarious for me to say, I built my fucking career on being a generalist loudmouth, and it's like, yes, fair cop, and that's I'm one of the people who help create a incentive structure for people who go online to talk about politics, which was if you just act like you know everything about... everything, enough people will take you seriously, they'll pay you to talk, and then you don't have to do any, you have to work anymore, which is what we're all trying to do is avoid the fucking wood shipper, the woodshipper that is whippling around us at every moment of our lives, or is we perceive it as such, even if it we're materially relatively secure, but as saying is that now, you know, I think is a time to like pick which you think you can. confidently articulate and I feel like I have found through a lot of bullshitting and a lot of uh a lot of public uh thinking through, I have found like a a a dement of like human thought, conception, whatever, information that I feel relatively confident about talking about, of course, just by lock, it's the stuff that's easiest to learn about buse it's really just about absorbing information and then collating it, you don't need to apply it the way that a scientist does, that's why I respect them, or apply it in any real sense, because you don't have any, you don't really have like cowork. or customers in the traditional sense, so you're not bound by those relationships, uh, it's a weird place to be, but it's left me here feeling like, okay, this is stuff I can talk about, and I really try not to talk about, I'm trying to win myself off of talking about anything, I don't feel like I have something to really add, uh, and that's why I'm like cutting myself away from predicting things, besides trying to sketch out like a three-dimensional model for like the the slice of time we find ourselves. uh because it it attenuates any like i think some people might be better to to predict specifically if they had more grounding in certain empirical scientific traditions than i do so and like questions of economics like i like the arguments about you know uh uh mmt and fucking uh uh job guarantee versus UBI i don't know enough and i don't think I don't think I'm going to find myself motivated enough to learn enough about that stuff to add anything that anybody else hasn't already said better than me, all I can do is like from my position of understanding observe the argument and see which one's convincing, that's all you can ever do, it's chilly, it's getting cold, and then it's apparently going to be a storm this weekend, oh boy. That's why I like to talk about history because I feel like I'm on a nice solid ground there. No, I know in the broad sense what happened, and that's why politics, politics is essentially history backwards, politics is essentially like, I mean political science, I mean, like, you, whatever you call political science, the made up science of political science, it's history backwards, we're trying to turn it and sc see the other way, you see the other way through the telescope, and it's possible, but you need to have tools I don't have, so I like to do a little bit of that, then I like to use mostly history cuuse I feel like I've got a better uh, grab on that one, because all you got to do is read, easy, don't have to do math, oh my god, kill me, what happen if I shaved my beard, I would probably lose subscribers. will say that, i'll just put it at that and leave it, i don't think it'll ever happen, just like with the shaving of the head, i don't think it's going to happen, if it didn't happen at the height of the first quarantine uh, before i even had my you know uh, my moment of enlightenment that i've been, has helped me cope ever since, it's not going to happen now, somebody said, somebody keeps talking about Ethan hawk in the chat, the other day they said that ethan hawk personally called us out. and said chapo he hates chapo, which I never found out if that's true, nobody said it to me on twitter, nobody like said CC, this happened, and now they're saying that Ethan Hawk says that he is a marxist leninist, is this happening, are these things happening or is there a weird guy creating like a paro reality in the chat and trying to get me to participate in him because he's a little sicco, is Ethan Hawk gonna be the American Gaddafi, I highly doubt it, I don't think that's going to happen. such a weird guy to pick Ethan Hart the rich man's Stephen Dorf Ethan Hunk I did finished Ragon Land it's great uh wonderful I don't I'm I hope he doesn't keep going I feel like he there's at this point it's redundant like anything other anything from then would be a different project and uh probably not one. that he's that interested in, i presume, apparently he's doing uh uh work on like the early democratic party, i think, if he is, i am very excited about that, uh, i would love to see, oh god, rick pearlstin writing about martin van burren, give me that. Who will be the lib pinkertons? wasn't that lib uh isn't that the antifa Pinkerton who domed that guy in denver? i know it's horrible and i'm not happy it happened, but there's something slapstick about it, the whole setup, it's hard not to laugh, i'm sorry, just the way that he just, i mean and the guy does seem like a kind of a douche, you know, not that sat. like you know I don't get sad about way better people than him dying, but uh, I just don't like the whole spectacle of that shit, I just find it, I really don't, it's it's more than anything it just depresses me because it shows how far we are from real politics, the way it goes, no, this is not a ranger regiment jacket, I'm stealing three types of... valor with this shirt, three types of valor are being stolen with this bomber jacket, so you've got here the United States uh, marshall service, then we have airborne here, that's right, second rangers, and then so I'm stealing valor from those organizations, and I'm also stealing valor from the cast of the film conner. because I do not in fact, I did not in fact work on that movie, so stealing this jack, wearing this jacket is in fact daller that, this was my Halloween costume this year, uh, it was high concept, so the premise is, I was not Teddy Kgb, I had the ketdy, Teddy KGB, I had my my red sweat uh, my my red jumpsuit on, and then I had a button down, I didn't have this shirt, had I had a button down kind of Halloween looking shirt that was pretty close to the war the one he won. I was not teddyb. I was John Malkovic on the set of Khan Air buse Khan Air came out uh I think two years or a year before rounders so uh if oh yeah I'm sorry I'm the set of rounders not conner so if hypothetically melković was standing around waiting for a take. like drinking a coffee on a set of rounders, he might well have been wearing this jacket between takes, so that was the halloween idea, and it was good, i got the the beard played, i want i always want to make if i do a halloween costumes, i want my facial shit to play, i don't like it with if i don't have a mustache, if if the guy doesn't have a beard it's kind of annoying if i have a beard. or glasses, same thing, and the glasses are non negotiable, i am blind as a back, another reason they probably wouldn't love the military, really really bad eye, i had i have to get special lenses that take the regular thickness and reduce them because if i didn't do that, this this lens would probably be like maybe maybe a half inch thick quarter inch. i really am a physical wreck, you can kind of see how i ended up being very dualistic so for for much of my life, my body did feel kind of like a fucking prison, like i couldn't move it the way i wanted to, i couldn't hear, uh, couldn't see for shit, i could get contacts, i think, but i've never looked into it, i never wanted totax, one, i think i look better with glasses, my eyes are... deep set i kind of sit back there, kind of look like a cereal killer, uh, and the other is, i don't want to stick my finger in my eyeball every day, that's gross. ooh, smoke weed, i do, somebody wants me to do yoda for some reason, off off that loud, i am, i am the answer, by the way to the question posed by e1, what if yoda was six tall, 6x foot tall and small smoke weed, you're looking at them right here buddy, this is this is if yota was 6 feet tall and smoked weed, what if yoda was 6 feet tall, and spoke we grogu is not yoda, obviously, i thought we were all clear on this, grogu? is a baby of the species of yoda, what have you ever say? feet tall and he smoke weed boom shout out to e1 boys very good very good podcast very very very very talented we're all we're all very fond of them i am not a star wars nerd i i was as much a star wars as anyone who grew up when i did i mean i had star wars sheets i had star wars pop-up book i have the star wars figures i saw the movies a bunch of times but it was just part of like a broader palette of pop culture that i've also watched, like i remember getting really excited to see the fat man movie waiting in line when i was a little kid. uh, i like that too, you know, it just it was back then things didn't define you that way, because we weren't at the micro-sect level of pop culture, there was still a broad mainstream and you were just a part of it, you didn't, unless you were a nerd, which was when nerd meant something, and like i was a nerd about some things i was a nerd about the civil war. That was my star wars, that was my pokemon, that was whatever the hell you people were into, while you were while you were partying at uh with your poke decks, playing match the gathering, I was studying the blade of Joshua Laurence Chamberlin, which you used to lead the 20th main down little roundtop on the second day of gettiesburg, july 186. I was reading the civil war books, I was looking through big civil war mat books, I had this, I literally had you guys had pok decks, I had a service, they would mail me like every month a pack of essentially civil war trading cards, they were, but they were about the size of um, they were the size of like recipes and they came and you got a recipe book or a recipe box and then they came the about the... size of like a postcard or a recipe card and they had on the front they had like a battle or or a general or place or a piece of military equipment and and the back i'd have the stats and i would so that was i i didn't really have a pop culture thing, i've developed those like you know attachments as i got older and i engaged with like this new pop culture where oh now there's a now nerd is like a category that you can like choose from and oh what's this? it's basically absorbing all of culture, because the things that make nerd being nerdy cool, are the things that you learn are cool in or the things that make you nerdy are the things that in college you learn are actually cool, and so the culture is it comes more collegy becomes nerdier, and everyone gets pulled towards nerd or pulled away from nerd. uh, that's the weedden snider divergence, but i never cared enough. about it, because it was not grounded in like the child, I think buse all a lot of the reason this is so powerful for people, the Ya people and the and and the the Devon Ferraccis and the movie Bob type guys is because this ties them deeply to that period of time when their lives were promised when they felt fresh with with life and enthusiasm and they had you know life ahead of them and they they want to like stay connected to that and I understand it, I think one of the reasons I was never able to like fully get inford with any of the stuff, even though of course. I was I got went along, I i watched the Marvel movies, I enjoyed them, I it was a way, it was what people like I were talking about, so I talked about it with them, but I never gave my soul over to it, because where that is in my in me is not in fucking Star Wars or fucking comic books or any of that shit, it's it's the second day of Geddiesburg, coming down little roundtop, and they don't put that shit in those movies, very rarely. I was, I'm certainly not as much of a warner as the actual warner, like that guy is me on like every type of like you know steroid of talent, like far better writer than I could ever hope to be, you know, and therefore a more rigorous thinker and there like a much broader spectrum of knowledge than I could ever hope to attain uh, because it powered me, but you know I was never very... powered because my talents were meger and my uh motivation also and maybe even less so uh but yeah i'm thinking more and more that that the alternative history of reconstruction might be my long-term writing project i might do some other stuff but i'm starting to think i might like sit down i mean it would start with just reading i'm going to have to really go back and look a lot more like reread phoneer start with rereading the boys and then everything i've missed you know since i kind of got destroyed by the internet and then i might do it, i might do that, might happen. watch this space, if it does start happening, i will certainly talk it out here, like that will be a very useful, i think that'll be useful for my process i think, so if i actually start doing this and start reading about it, i'll probably do a little book club as i'm going through the stuff, moving through, does that sound good? like whatever i'm reading at the moment, i'll probably start with four, makes sense right? yeah, so we'll do a fonner uh book club very shortly, i mean maybe at the beginning. Maybe next year we should shoot for it cuuse I got stuff I got to do uh in December so yes next year going to start a Fanner book club on here not like a whole hour but you know like a little chunk at the end or something and we'll and we'll go through fonner and we're all we'll do the boys after that probably those two and then maybe like I'll just do them like as I read the book I'll maybe talk about it instead of going through the whole thing we'll see we'll see. what people want to do if it's still even a thing if i'm still here to do it but uh there's a a couple books by at least one book by James Oaks i really want to read uh and then actually there's a big you know what else I might want to uh actually do I'm wondering if I should even do it before fanner oh there's this book called uh I haven't read it and if people anyone has and you have a review please let me know because I think I might start with this one the same way when me and Chris started talking about uh the politics of uh like uh the early Republic for a project we we read um the Willins book Rise of American Democracy like it covers that arrow great and then you can build from there uh and I want something that you can start from like even below the level of reconstruction uh and and that covers the period, and there's a there's a book called, I hope I'm remembering the title here, it's it's it's a it's a rather cumbersome title, yes, the republic for which it stands, the United States during reconstruction and the gold guilded age by Richard White, I was thinking if that's good, if people have heard it because I haven't read it, and I'd like to start maybe with something I have read before, uh, we could start there just to get like the the political uh in the greater uh context and then founder from there, so anyone knows we'll do that and if not we'll start with connor, i am and i have to admit, so all right, so i'm thinking about it, i don't know yet what the project will end up. looking like there's a maybe i could do it, god help me i could do it like as a novel oh my god turtle dove style which is maybe too cringe uh or sort of like a little monograph like that lin's book that just sort of sketches it out sort of like an alternative like historical chronicle more scoloting less cringy maybe the whole thing is cringe no matter what? Maybe counter narrative history is inherently cringe, I think an argument could be made, but at the same time I'm trying to move towards the thing that I think I can fire my enthusiasms around and get me over the hump of like presenting uh, you know, a coherent view of something. No musical, let me say this, it's not going to be a musical, there will be no rapping, there will be no hippity happy, rapidy, crappity. Well yeah, it is wish fulfillment, but the thing is is what I would want to do is I would want to stear away from like the best of all possible world scenario. I would i would not, I would want to like self-consciously, if either way I did it, I would be, I would want to push against the head winds of my of my fantasy of what I would want, and I think I could do that the more grounded it is historically, that's why I want to read a bunch and reread stuff before I even start, because I don't want to just make it a little uh, a thumb sucker, because the only reason. counterfactual history is useful is if it allows you to see how mechanisms play out, where fluidity exists within a system and where and where like energy and force. to be applied and you could do that sometimes more clearly by abstracting yourself away from the moment which is too fired with uncertainty to really be able to uh articulate whereas you could just sort of if you study the past it up you can sort of project out a little blurry alternative pathway you know like if you know enough about the conditions where things arose from you can start building a dream you know if not a dream of ultimate victory a dream of alternative, a second way, dog is barking, woo, doggies, get killed walk in yoggy, is he here, richard, you can sit in my ex, my wife's ex-hus. husband's post dead techmodernistic bullshit house, but you will not watch my television, favorite rapper, got to be young mc in that he's the one I probably have listen to the most in my life, buse man, I i really burned through Stone Cold Ryan in Junior High, played that shit non-stop, I knew all the lines in every song on that tape for a while, now though, even years later, I no all of uh bus to move of course got that one tattooed on my brain but also more uh more uh obscure ones like uh principal's office so yeah definitely young mc yeah no i'm a boomer guys i i i warn you going in i don't pretend to be one of your uh one of your comrades I don't pretend to be from the screets, I'm not, I'm not Steve Bushemi rolling in with my fucking skateboard and my rock band or music band shirt saying, how do you do fellow kids, that's not me, I'm old as fuck, look at my hairline, look at this shit, it's a fucking, it is a wasteland, the golf coast right now. I am not a reactionary now, that's the one thing I don't think I am, I don't think I'm a reaction, I mean depending on what you mean by that, of course, people can make it mean whatever they want, apparently, I do feel like I have a different perspective on this shit because I am not a fully digitized citizen, I have been digitized, but in my adult life. I know a time before digitization, I'm being pulled through the fucking stargate, through the black hole, being spaghettified, but I'm in the process, I didn't come out a strand of spaghetti, and that I think doesn't make me better, and I think that's a lot of the stupid heat and argument about all this generational politics, which is 90% bullshit anyway, boils down to this charged idea that there's like a judgment behind it, there's not, it's just position and time, position and time and relationship to means of production. and the technology there of, that's the difference, there's nothing to be judged about it. the saying is I think that I it allows me to see some of what's happening because I can still watch like it following up my arm, you know, like I can feel it moving through, like uh, you know, blood poisoning, it's not just my whole circulatory system, but the thing about that is is that means that I am, I am. going to be limited in my ability to understand anything that's happening because I'm on the other side of this thing, I'm not fully within it, which means that I don't really know what's going on, I can't, all I can do is offer like a uh orthogonal commentary on it, the thing itself is going to have people within it, and the people within it are going to have responsibilities to themselves, to their families and loved ones to try to you, take Destiny's wheel. and they are going to have knowledge that I don't have, because they are going to be a culturated to these ways in a way that I never will be, and so settle up partners, I wish you well, I just I'm not going to act like I can say you're going to save anybody, but there's anything determined by your being younger, by being immersed in this techno world, alienated even further from life than people before you, uh, that that's going to make you in hand apparently the revolutionary cadre who save the world? i'm afraid not, nothing destined about it, it's in our hands, we're going to have to reach across all these arbitrary boundaries and come to together for any hope of an alternative to full liquid social liquidification. I'm revisionist, of course I'm a revisionist, that's such a stupid fucking accusation. Revisisionism had, it's like all these mid-century terms, people are cas playing, like tanky, whose tanks? there's no fucking tanks, there's nobody you could even plausibly say are the tanks, I'm sorry, china doesn't count, even in your heart you know, it's not the same thing. as the Soviet Union, it just isn't, because it's not, because these the Chinese communist state say whatever you want about it, is not missionary the way that the Soviet was, there was not an internationalism to it, you couldn't join the club, they don't want you as a member, they want to make a deal with you, and that's a different relationship to it than the relationship between western communists and the Soviet Union, so those were their tanks in their heart in a way that doesn't exist anymore, so tanky is meaningless and like it obscures the thing because that puts weight and power morally behind questions that mean nothing, like whether you were going to stand for the purges in a western communist party that had meaning, you were fighting for power, you were fighting against other people who were in the broad left trying to trying to move towards uh like a conversation with capital during the the uh the collapse of capitalism, you were fighting, you were fighting a battle and it had stakes and so of course it had moral weight, there's no moral weight to these questions because there's no this tanks don't belong to anybody, revisionist is the same thing, revisionist was a meaningful slur because you were revising away from a a understood practice that undergirded a global movement, there is not, you're not revising away from anything, you're rising away from my boutique understanding of marxism that nobody else agrees with except you're your fellow cleak members, all you can do is threaten to kick me out of a cleak, i've revised, yes i've revised from you, but nobody else. but your fellow travelers think that that's the case, not like uh revising away from a like a communist government or a a a communist history of state actions, like oh this was evisionism, you can look back from a position of authority, there is just like with the tanks, the tanks there's no real tanks, revisionism, there's no real book, like there's no real reifified idea that you can deviate or revise from. and so in both cases the whole vocabulary only serves to obviscate reality and and mystify the conditions of every argument you're trying to have, this is what I mean when I say that this is this place is poison if you try to, buse like why are you talking about this stuff, why are you care about questions that would even read you to call someone a tanky or revisionist, it's because you're trying to do politics and if that's what politics are, you swung and missed again, if you're doing something else, that's one thing, but if this is what you're doing, it's not enough, me included, i'm saying time out for covid, but seriously, all right, i'm going to go soon, it's getting chilly out here, was i being trolled, about the guy, the Ethan hawk guy, was he trolling me? All right, well like I said, sure, I'm revisionist, but who are you going to call? Who are you going to call? Marxbusters, there's no one there, there's no one whose authority you can call on that will be universally agreed upon by any subsection that you could broadly call the left, so there's no um, there's no enforcing orthodoxy intellectually, just like there's no uh enforcing orthodoxy politically through the barrel of the soviet. uh the red army's guns in the warsaw pack, and that is the that is the condition, that is the the condition of western politics where the drive train has been broken, because there is no working class movement undergirding any of this just like there's no soviet government undergirding a uh a a marxist leninist praxis of state power wielding, of a condition of an intensity deep enough to impact or in the west, trade unions and labor movements and labor parties. I should wear a Kimono, I would like to wear a Komona one of these days. When I get back in, when it gets too cold to come out here, I might get, I might, I might get a camona, I've been looking for a robe, I haven't been able to find one, but yeah, I'm a revisionist, call the KGB, they don't care, call the KGB, I'll just have.
