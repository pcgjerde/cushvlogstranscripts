 shit i got knocked off fuck damn i got knocked off uh that's too bad they might get um shit i might not be able to post that one later because i don't know if it's going to get saved. just kicked me off, i don't know what happened, damn it, i got to remember that, somebody remember that, somebody who watched that the first one, please remember that, cuz now i'm going to forget, shit, god damn it, i was going to watch that again, i thought i had something, fuck, got to get on twitch, i got to fuck, we got to figure out how to get on twitch, that makes so much more sense than this bullshit, fuck, i think i lost that whole recording, shit, fuck. damn it, just kicked me off, 37 minutes in, like less than that, ah, god damn it, that's a bummer, I'm very bummed now, I'm just sad, hopefully I'll remember that again to talk about in the future, but I thought I had something there talking about uh, the futures before us, the eliminationism or or, I guess I was trying to think about the singular. Yeah, that's right, singularity uh, and how that happens, how like you turn humans into just like feedback, like little uh plug and play devices, like pure appetite and and satiation, like pure ab like strip them of all uh, of all identifying traits, like the kind of things that you get from having a life that is yours, a life that is the dream of communism, instead, like pure mechanistic life uh that replicates the market structure and the market transactions. and that works uh and that turns you just into a uh a feeding machine a feeding and producing machine uh and then like if you're needed to feed you feed if you're needed to work you work and it's at the behest of this uh algorithm this totally uh alienated algorithm I mean it might have people who serve it and are better off than you like there's still a hierarchy and that's what keeps people in line but they're still like serving this thing that's alienated from humanity that's uh that's what the uh the sing is the singularity is when they're brought together and they're and humans become part of the machine, like they become part of the the binary code, like human interactions are just part of the code, it's part of the fucking computer doing it, it's computations, it literally becomes the hardware, it literally becomes the hardware, it's like the matrix, that's it, and that's where we're going to go, if we let them do this to us, or i mean i guess it's more likely, it's just one more step. on the road because you get this and then you got climate apocalypse coming up, they're gonna uh, it's going to be a thing about windowing down populations and keeping the people populations, we do have require uh fully uh uh uh god what's what's the fuco term uh disciplined fully uh surveill i don't know like fully dominated like just fully uh at every level surveiled and it's and and your actions uh tail so that's what they're trying to get us to have that's what they're hoping to get us with, they're hoping to get us into become the fucking network, they become the fucking wetware of the algorithm that is capitalism, yeah baby, yes, yes, biopower, isn't that one? talks about, maybe he wasn't totally full of shit, just mostly. oh, what epoch? what epoch? uh, what epoch? um, does this arrow remind me most of? this is a good question. Well, one thing I would have to have is a crisis of uh leadership. Uh, I mean, and I know that sounds idealistic and non-marxist, but I got to tell you man, there is something that is very end stage, just like as an identifying marker, not necessarily a cause. Uh, there's nothing that indicates an end-stage uh uh power structure, then it's controlled by actual incompetence. uh, that that is where the flaws in the in the like, the flaws that are sort of written into the code of something like monarchism or democracy, democracy or capitalism, capitalist democracy or whatever, uh or or soviet communism for example or Chinese communism or whatever like uh the end stages of them all uh have that in common that the leadership is genuinely decrepit, it has been rendered so by either literal imbreeding like the old monarchs of Europe or in our case the a false meritocracy replicating itself where you have these uh you have this meritocratic class who engineer things so that just by coincidence, their next generation of meritocrats are, what's this, their kids, what's what a coincidence? so they replicate essentially a a literal blood aristocracy, but through this market mechanism and this like uh, this uh, this justification, this like justification that replaces like the divine right of the old aristocracy, because nobody believes in god anymore, so you can't say it's mine by right of God, they say it's mine by right of... of justice because we've inculcated like Rosy and Justice is a social norm uh even though what they mean by justice because they have these things are technically available to all and some people do rise up but they replicate their own privilege and their kids are like the children of the most elete powerful everywhere almost universally shitty scummy pieces of fucking scum shit who don't understand anything about the world who are psychotically self-obsessed who are basically sociopaths uh rendered so by their class position and like they're they're absolute distance from anything resembling like real human life and suffering and then they uh they take over and it's like it's and that is a byproduct of of capitalism specifically capitalism's democratic loss how does how does capitalism deal with the fact that in order to maintain its legitimacy culturally uh it has to have a democratic face uh but also if democracy was real people could literally just vote themselves to communism which was the theory of revisionist marxism. uh and the uh like Bern Stean and Couchski uh and it looked like it was working uh and then a bunch of things were invented by the very very capable and improvisory capitalism, one being fascism of course, a way to replicate mass politics on the right uh, and also uh circumscribing politics and one way to circumscribe politics uh is to make it elite. and you make it a leat by putting barriers up that are related to social standing that is hypothetically neutral, but in reality replicates a class privilege, it's just it's it's a secular sanitation of aristocracy, that's what the meritocracy is, and so these people are just as much uh a clueless dollars as the the court of Louistur uh or or uh or the mad king george or any of them. Ah, yes, yes, indeed, so anyway, uh, that makes me think, what's one of them, uh, it's got to be about a declining empire, that's the first and most important uh, like fundamental feature, it has to be an actual empire, not a regular state, it has to be a empire, either formal or informal, that is collapsing, uh, that doesn't mean that the state will necessarily collapse, uh, after all, the British fire 100 years ago was the most powerful force on earth it controlled something like a third of the world's population or or or uh in a huge chunk of its territory that's why the sun literally never set on it because there was part of it everywhere in the world uh their empire is gone but their state still exist they they've latched on to us as little barnacles will we latch on to somebody else could we latch on to China and get a deal that like yeah we lower the standard of living but not all at once and uh and incontention with you know getting uh the ability to come to you come over there i don't know or like piggy back on your shit i don't know so that you could do more formal you can do more uh you can lay off some of the like we would lay off some of that um military might like all that defense spending we'd lay some off on China uh in exchange for getting able to do more uh domestic spending which is what like the the declining European powers did with us after World War II so anyway um so that's another thing, so it doesn't necessarily mean that the state will class, but the the empire is is at a terminal point, uh, the the the economic collapse, that's usually a part of the de cline of empires, uh, the fucking plague is what's kill tripping me up, because like we literally have a plague that is a hell of a wild card, obviously. the capitalism was very shaky right there going up and they like this corona thing kind of gave them an aliby for a collapse it was going to come but i don't think even even the most line go down uh hardcore uh believer would disagree that this is going to be worse than it would have been uh, maybe you don't agree with that, but I really do think that this is going to make it much worse than it would have been if it had been a sort of natural outgrowth of a uh cyclical downturn, and now they got to plead off plead it off on fucking the the rona, um, what's another one? Maybe we're Britain, maybe we're Britain in the interwar period, and this is World War II, and we maybe we are Britain in the interwar period, I was talking about, then the in the war uh in the war, like 911 and the war on terror is like the interwar period and the end world war I, uh, and then this is the collapse, this is like the the climax, this is the the blow-up uh, and then they never came back. from it, but they also didn't go into you, turmoil, they didn't become, they didn't got shattered, I honestly wonder if the thing that will save us is our complacency and laziness is a people, like will be just, will be at the end of the day find it too much work to come to blows in the civil war, is that what will happen, like at the end of the day it'll just be like, oh man, really, getting the... getting the militia together, like going to the state line and and like doing expeditions to the nearby towns, really, it sounds like a lot of work, you if you do it that'd be cool, i support you, i'll put the fucking thing on my bumper of my car, but man that sounds like a fucking pain in my ass, remember on 100,0 truckers we're going to block every uh park every uh road going in and out of dc until uh oh bumbler crumbo was uh deposed and executed on the white house lawn, how many people showed up? i think it was bj and the bear, get that reference guys, bj and the bear, bj and the bear, folks, uh, the other thing i was saying on the other stream that i hope i don't forget was about uh the possibility we have to do real um automation of uh plan like planning. economic planning, the idea that we could plan economic transactions uh with with computing power uh to replace the the price mechanism of capitalism, i really think we have the ability, i think that the the stride, the uh the the strides forward we've seen from what the soviets did in the 50s uh read plenty by uh by Francis booford is a great book about that, i recommend anyone, very fun too and very well written, in addition to being very. interesting and and uh enter and uh educational uh and to Chile and iyende and how he tried to go against America's economic war that preceeded the cou by creating a system for uh uh planning the economy which was destroyed by the fucking asshole army when they did the coup so that was in the 70s man and now we've got computers that has been pointed out a million times. uh we have the computing power in our pockets to go to the moon i guarantee you that we have more uh your fucking pager probably has more computing power than all those banks of terminals that got machine gun by pinche's goons in 1973. what can we do with that and what are we already doing in terms of planning economies? amazon which is this a state within a state within a state which has all the putterances of the state in terms of inputs and outputs and and capital uh physical plan. uh, that it's internal decisions are not made by the market and price points, it's made by central planning, and it works, so if we could just strip the bark of capitalism off the fucking thing, it could be an actual mechanism for fulfilling fucking human needs in a time of crisis, can you imagine this a thing? no, you can't imagine it, because if we did it, then at the end of this they would never, we would never let them take it away, that would be a red line for every human on earth, that would be a thing that would never be allowed to happen. so yeah, I'm thinking I'm back, ah man, hi guys, how's everyone doing? is anyone drinking cheap lambrusco and looking at the giancallo hills overlooking rome? is anyone loving that memory? Oh yeah, that'l be funny if this is on TV because of me going mad. Uh, what was that question? uh, what is the end game? that's an interesting question, the end, i mean it's i hate to be cliche, but it is socialism or barbarism, isn't it? it is, it is a it is a common wealth of mankind that is uh, that is that provides a stable basis for human flourishing that will not eventually destroy itself as all other systems will inevitably do, uh, or we will do what classes have done since time of memorial, uh, Mark says it in the manifesto, the higher to history of of man is a history of class conflict, and that conflict is between either slaves and masters, the peasants and few lords, or whatever and that when the rest that the conflict is one by one uh which advances humanity or both are destroyed, common ruin of the contending classes, and that will be the outcome, that will the crisis of profit, the inability to provide for human needs will create a savage return to barbarism, maybe a techno barbarism, but one that uh is never allows human life to flurish. again uh unless it fuses with the uh it fuses with uh technology unless the singularity happens that's the alternative that's the real like if you really want really put on your nickland like pinial gland hat the the choice really is yes a steady state human flourishing of capitalism something that ends up like with the with the Kim Stanley Robinson uh series like that kind of world or uh or or the matrix basically, or we become one with the algorithm of capitalism, we become the biological uh mechanisms of it, that's that's our options, so we will be man or machine, are we men or are we divo? uh people are asking like what's going to happen in terms of will there be food shortages, will there be riots, will there be fights? those things require a a knowledge of like the macro situation that i cannot uh, i cannot claim. uh, i'm sorry, uh, it's it's beyond my my skill set or pay. to to be able to divine at the micro level the transactions that are occurring at like the the the biological and the ecological and the economic and the social to tell you uh uh uh so yeah i don't know man i don't know all i know is what what what uh what the long-term the long duray will mean and know where the the crisis points will come, but I don't know which way the wind is headed yet, like there's a sick part of me that thinks the most likely outcome is that everything's kind of the same but shittier, like after this huge this this massive shift that like everything feels like the rails are calling off, everything is unprecedented, we're in a nightmare tunnel, uh, we're in a literal nightmare tunnel uh and we come out of the other end of it and it's like oh yeah it's basically the same but kind of shittier you know more people don't have jobs uh uh you know uh standards of living are going down a little bit more people level even more dead, but things are basically the same, only worse, which is what Felix has been talking about for the entire show's history, and I feel like he was right about Biden, we were all zipping and zapping and going up and down on the roller coaster with Bernie, and Felix was, we kind of almost tried to talk him out of it, but uh, he was right the whole time, and he's also been saying the same thing about this, even, I mean, maybe he would say differently now that we're in the middle of this, but I got to say something feels right, something feels darkly, awfully right about... it'll be the same except slightly shittier, because that big collapse, the destruction, it's like even if you die in it, it will still feel like judgment, it will still feel like climax, it will still feel like something meant something, like you you witness something, you are part of something, you are part of the end of something, and you'll know that even as you die, the worst. is, no, I don't know, I'm not part of the end of anything, I'm the part of the middle of some gold bullshit that will go continuing on beyond my death into just this awful gray Setty state. of steady decline into inhumanity, that's a bummer, that's a bummer, so honestly yeah, like the the the more dramatic, more doomer scenarios are the ones that are actually uh more in a narrative sense happy endings, more satisfying, you know what i mean, because if you're gonna go down either way. whether in 30 years or maybe you're going to be the one drowning in your own fucking fluids because you had to work a kroger shift so they wouldn't repossess your kia, you're still going to be out, would you rather be out in a blaze of of idiot glory, like to live in a Bosh painting, to live in a to see judgement to hear a voice from the fucking depths of of of the depth. of uh oh fuck the depths of uncaring space, a single voice, a single voice of judgment to render meaning and shape to what has until now been a pointless, feudal, painful, confusing existence, instead of just knowing that one of these days, it's going to be like: this and one of these days you're just not going to wake up, which would you rather have? and I kind of say, I kind of and then that's what makes me think the reality is going to be, we get off the ride and it's oh, everything is just kind of shittier, I have less money, uh, I live in a worse place, uh, I have worse health, more of my friends are dying of coronavirus, uh, until you're one of them, until you get claimed too, but slowly through entropy, uh, through just the exanguination of the spirit into complete enemy and alway, or you go down with the fucking ship, you go down with the fucking ship, you get to go down into the depths of the ocean lash to the back of the great white whale himself, to the last i grapple with thee, from hell's heart i stab thee, for hate sake i spit my last breath at thee, you get to have that, you get that, you know, you all know that that was the happiest moment in Ahab's life, right? that's i think that, i'm assuming, am i w? if anyone else is a is a uh, it's been a while since i've read Melby dick, if there's any other uh like english majors here who uh could contradict me, that's the happiest moment in Ahab's life, right? is the moment before he is sucked into the bottom. of the ocean because he's there, because he's on the wall, as opposed to just dying of scurvy, well fucking dicking around in the middle of the spanish main, oh boy, no, thank you, no, thank you, mister, yeah, i think someone said that one of the reasons that everyone likes Dr. strange love so much is that how could you not love a movie with such a happy ending? because that's the genius of strange love is to render uh apocalypse erotically, like the the nukes at the end are orgasms, the beginning of the movie is the is the is the beginning of the intercourse, the the first shots of the movie are are footage of in of uh midair refueling of like the uh of the uh of the uh missile command like uh b-52s that like flew up. perimeters Russia with all their nukes, so it starts with the sec, like literally the impregnation, then it ends with, we meet again, don't know God, do we meet again some sunny day, uh, everyone going at once, I've talked about this before, show and i'll play the song again uh uh uh um i'll play the Tom Layer song which is some other thing you want and it's the beauty of that of the nuke one is it was it it promised basically painless death like oh we'll die but it'll be you know you're going to be a fucking shadow on a wall probably or you'll be dead within a few months it's not going to be that bad but you'll know everyone else is going too so you know you're the you you've rendered you your life has been rendered meaningful even with slower decline, like if if we come out of this in a real crisis, like the us breaks up, I'm sorry, to know that you were, that you were there for the reign of the last president, that you know that whatever comes next is not going to be what was, you're the last American, you're it's like being somebody, it's like, it's like, think about, think about people, like think about somebody who was there for the sack of rome, you know, or like when the fucking crusaders took Jerusalem, i mean these are epocal moments, so yes, that's why i think like for your short term, if you have especially if you have young peop people in your life, if you have kids or you have. good, the short term, good, uh, but also, I think that's why it's most likely because it's the most most depressing, the most spiritually deadening possibility, so that's why I think it's most likely to be true, so good news, good news on that, but yeah, it's like I could say that now, it would be as horrible. is anything i could imagine, um, but you're going to die anyway, you know, okay, the fall of Constantinople then, how about that? oh yeah, one of those people who smashed the Berlin wall with the fucking uh sledge hammer, I mean there's a reason people still have those rocks hanging around. but of course that was one that didn't kill everybody uh thank you for saying you die for me uh i'm going to need a few of you too because otherwise i'm absolutely going to get owned i am 100% getting owned uh in the after after spearound oh fuck uh, i mean am i protechnology? well, i think i can tell you that if i know that we're either at the matrix or uh, if we're uh communism, if we're communism, cool, we technology got us there, if it's the matrix that i got to have to say, monday morning quarterback, thumbs down, so i guess i'd have to say since right now, i would argue with my gut, i feel like matrix is more likely, then no, thank you. Oh right, isn't it ansach day, this is the guy, you guys, how come is it, is it just like Australia's personality uh, like uh, inferiority complex vsav Britain, is that why they uh celebrate getting their asses kicked, because uh, I was talking to my friend Mit Reid about this, uh, and uh points out that it's not like you can't really point to any other Australian successes that could trioms that you could remember. I mean, yeah, they didn't have a great record in World War II, mostly getting captured by the Japanese, uh, and going into Vietnam with us, and going to Afghanistan with us, those were big uh bungles. Uh, I mean, what would you, you know, they're all bad uh, but like at the end of world of World War One, it was Australians that helped punch through the final. German lions and end the war, you know, instead they want to commemorate getting like zipped up by a bunch of fucking uh teenagers uh with wh just got a fresh greased maximum gun uh, because they get to like make the British feel guilty, I guess like, hey, yeah, remember that insect right, yeah, this one bloody chat chill just set this into the fucking, that's what chat city city the blind me bunger shoot, that's the... it's a it's a send us into the bleeding bumper shoot mate right yeah so cheer chill you put us in the bloody bumper shoot you put us in the bloody boomb yeah they also lost the word emus so way to go Australia. All right, that's a good question, actually, if we are going to be surfed in a neo feudal order, who should we feel swear our fielty to, which of the great lords, which of the great houses would you want to uh work with? I mean, like if you think about game of... there definitely were, it was all feudilism, you were being exploited, but they're definitely places you'd rather have been, like you definitely if you were you, even a a mere stable boy or or a groom, or a uh or a milkmaid, you'd much rather uh swear filty to house stark uh than house bolton, that's not a contest uh, i mean you sure as hell would rather have been a uh a uh surf to like - i don't like uh Elizabeth then uh or no um one of the one of the relatively competent english kings i don't then like Elizabeth Bathrate, I was just uh, so yeah, who do you want? Vizo seems like an absolute monster. Everything I've heard about him, about his the way he runs his company, uh, the his company's practices, he seems to be a self-consciously evil person, he is a guy who I think even in his own mind is the bad guy and he relishes that fact, he's sick, he's twisted, he's jokerified, so uh, I would definitely not want to place filty to uh house uh, house. Who else do we have? Zuckerberg? I would say on surface how Zuckerberg seems like it would be better, but how Suckerberg feels kind of like a Blueberg situation where it's like, hey, this is all fine and dandy, but you know, don't open this door, uh, because that's where you know you have 500,000 like permanently traumatized people getting paid pennies an hour in like the Philippines to watch snuff videos and like gang rapes that the people that they have to filter off of Facebook. That's like the fucking roomful of wives heads, so uh, no thank you for Facebook, so now thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, house Zuckerberg, um, house gates, the guy is a for skinkin eating google, he's he's an epistean guy, you want to sear clear the epstean people as possible, I know that's hard, there are a lot of non-epsten powers, um, I guess I know Disney, I'll be a soy guy, ah, I'm an entertainer, right, ah, I can do soy face, oh my god, the new marvel movies out, ah, I've seen all those pieces of shit, I'm I'm like compelled to watch them, ah, so yes, I will swear my, how's Disney, how's Disney, I'll I'll I'll do, I'll do an unboxing youtube series where I unbox fucko pops about fucking uh, Dr. Strange 3, which is on like on 10-minute episodes on qu'. ah oh how's maskas like uh it's like a guy like making his uh it's like a Egyptian pharaoh burying his servants with him he's taking you to mars to like live in the foundation of his giant necropolis no thank you i'll take iger eiger seems like a like a kind of a laidback dude. I can do the soy face, I'm right, pretend this is a, this is a uh, pretend this is a martian man hunter, oh no, wait a minute, that's dc, damn it, what's a really stupid marvel superhero, there's a lot of them, uh, All right, uh, no, Antman, moonnight is good, moonnight's good, yes, I pretend that this is like a moonnight action figure from uh, like guardians of the galaxy 6, how's that? is that good? I've been to Braz, somebody asked if I've been to Latin America, I've been to Brazil once, that's about it, uh, it's pretty cool, uh, this is before Bolsonaro, this is the end, near the end of Dilma's rule, uh, every middle middle class person uh, we met was wildly hated uh, Dilma, and uh, they were, they were really like American teacts, like a guy told the... about how yeah, they had free healthcare in Brazil, but it was bad because people were like getting aids on purpose or something so that they could go to the doctor or like because they didn't care about getting to the doctor or something cuuse they'd get it for free. uh, but yeah, one of our guys we knew was a uh, he was, he owned, he was raising money with his boyfriend to get, oh start a crossfit studio, so I guarantee you they all love balsamaro, but it's beautiful, it's beautiful, we shouldn't, people shouldn't live there probably, we should leave those rainforest alone, I have not been to Palestine. I forget a sange, I don't know what I, I don't know if I do, I don't know what that means, McConnell is gonna going to let the states go bankrupt. "I think it depends on what that means, I mean, I don't know, I don't know what the conditions are going to be, I mean, I think he would do whatever it took to stave off a complete collapse of the system to the point of like states no longer contributing one another's, you know, infrastructure, therefore breaking ties, literal centrifical force pushing America apart, like I think he would want to avoid that, I don't think he wants to preside over the the uh dissolution of the United States." but I don't know what the minimum uh action, whatever the minimum action to prevent that will be is what he will do, how about that? I don't know if that's going to be yet, it might be that they bail out the states, it might be that they figure out a way around doing that, uh, the way that like keeps creditors whole, all I know is makes things the same but worse. "if you want to be my lover, you got to get with my got to get with my friend, forever, friendship never r. i watched warmwood, it's very good, it's very good because it reminds you of the possibility of limited hangouts, the idea that uh, that people can uh, like organizations like the CIA can admit to things that look very bad for that." and that that but that in the long-term are things that they can handle going out that don't like destroy their foundation uh and that serve the benefit to them of making them look forthright uh and look like you know what's going on there and so like it was supposed to be a scandal for years that the CIA uh dosed Frank Olson without his knowledge and that he jumped out that window so they were willing to admit that they do their own guy to see what would happen because the end of the day it's like well that's fucked up but happened a number of years ago most of those guys are dead and it seems like kind of like a party prank gone wrong honestly which disguises the massive massive size of mklshure the number of fucking uh prisons and uh colleges that got mk ultra funding uh the number of places where the number of people hundreds and hundreds of of students and prisoners like from whitey bulger to Ted Kazinski uh being exposed to massive amounts of LSD on a daily basis without their consent or not. what they were, what was happening, but they turn it into like basically an animal house uh sketch, like oh, he jumped out the window because he thought he could fly, the real thing is they murdered him cuuse he was going to spill the beans about the us using fucking uh biological weapons during the korean war, that that's a spicier meepal, that's closer to the bone, and if you if you say the first thing you don't have to say the second thing cuz people stop looking, i think we have to think a lot about that in terms of what we think we know and how much stuff is limited in its uh in its hangout, but you can't go too far that way because that's how becomes wildly paranoid. i kind of gave up on a better call sall, i found uh the whole um uh as soon as they made it about guss and and hey this is how uh hector got his stroke i was like i don't give a fuck i know how all this ends and i know if it was this interesting it's all like let it be in your head, you don't need to know everything uh, and the fact that it's been four seasons and he's still not fucking sal goodman, give me a fucking break, this is prestige bullshit, the i mean honestly as good as better has been, the talent in front of behind the camera would have better utilized if they just said we're not doing prestige, we're going to do an old fashion tv show, we're going to do like the rockford files with a sleezy lawyer with the with with fucking Oden Kirk and those guys and in that show, rockford files with a crooked lawyer, instead it's like it's breaking bad junior where you can't move it forward on any of those stories because it happens before, so you're left. with this these dead end things that aren't going to lead anywhere and get drawn out forever and by the way uh anyway mini breaking bat uh oh the only parts of breaking of better calls all i like are the black and white parts the very beginning when he's a cinnabun manager in omaho because i don't know what's going to happen cuz it still has some friend there's still some tension like when he was waiting to the... get them to put his social security number in the machine correctly, you know what's going to happen, fuck it, fuck better calls all, there it goes, because because it's it's it's creative misteps are the result of following a template of prestige television that I've hated for years and we literally have seen a perfectly good project destroyed by it, there i said it, I should write, I think I'm going to type up that high. take after this and see everyone get mad at me, but I'm going to be correct, I'm going to be correct. No, this is a correct take sir, so this is a correct take. Matt rules, that is also a correct tape. I'm i rule, bring bad, is an example of the tragic lamens of prestige televator. Thank you, good take 100%. Thank you, adopt a cap to a fellow connosaur of televisual storytelling. I'm in a shed. Are you in some sort of hole? It's not a hole, it's a space underneath a deck, it's it's my backyard area, it's this humble little uh postage stamp of land that gives me a little bit of air, uh, and I like to smoke out. here and uh and it's late to earth so i put my light on so i don't have any other up here lights but i'm going to get a grill it's going to be nice going to get a grill i'm going to get nicer chairs i have pretty bad chairs out here uh and then i'm going to chill out going to chill going to get a shas long it's going to be nice there i can actually practice what i've been preaching about grill pilling i haven't been able to grill yet after since i've said i want to grill i haven't been able to grill it's fresh ready but i'm going to start grilling guys hand to god okay on god, i'll start grilling, i swear by Allah, by allah, least evil us president is obviously lincoln, there's no compass because if you look at evil and good is like of like a good place. style point system, Lincoln got all the bad points off that all American presidents of the 19th century got, mostly related to native American disposession and genocide. He did preside over the largest mass desicution in American history of uh of su indians in Minnesota, after an uprising there in the middle of the civil war. He also instituted the homestead act, which was just a giant settler free for all, but just to come to get come to get it buffet on uh native American land. So, but every other president in the 19th century has all those same points off. Lincoln has ending slavery, so that means even if he's still in the red, even if he doesn't go to heaven, he is still relatively way higher up in the rankings of just like pure numbers, like pure negative or positive numbers of you know sin points as any American president could ever come close to, second, I would say John Quince adams, but he's a distance second obviously. Oh and US Grant, those are the top three, yeah, that's it, those are the three least evil, and like I said, I don't even know if they have positive or negative point numbers, but they have way fewer negative points than any of the other ones. Grant was cool Quince Adams, well he was a uh, I mean he was a one-termer so he had less time to do bad stuff, he was a guy who promoted, he did want a non confrontational indian policy, I mean compared to a guy like Jackson or even Van Buren, uh, he was a fucking uh, peace nick on the the question, he presided over a slave state country, but he was against slavery and uh, he uh fought against it afterwards as a congressman, I mean he famously defended the Amastad uh uh uh uh Africans before the civil before the supreme court as depicted in the Stephen Spielberg. film Amastad, so yeah, no, I would say, oh, and he uh, you know, he is, the visionaries of non-interventionist American foreign policy, there's reason that those those like that coke funded uh uh, think foreign policy think tank that just opened, it's called the John Quince Adams institute, because he's like the the the guiding light of those kind of guys, like the guy who warned against even in it was still very early stages what American imperialism expansion. would mean in terms of moral, he was a clarian call, like he knew what was going to happen, he knew what expanding westford was going to do, how he was going to just just destroy the spirit and like the morality of any kind of project that was being done in America, how was going to just fundamentally rupture uh uh the social fabric and destroy the legitimacy of the state from a moral perspective uh so I give him a lot of credit on that, and then Grant you now president over Indian massacres and stuff, but also also did not want to do. that I mean he did want to pursue a more uh more a less violent uh Indian policy but those around him or not interested in doing it and he couldn't really ever assert control that way um but he also effectively pursued reconstruction fucking broke up the clan from in its first iteration uh and and as soon as he left the whole thing fell fucking apart but like he put the his he put his foot on the gas there uh and I give him respect for that, so those are my top three, oh wonder Wilson was a fucking maniac, uh, our only PhD president, our only nerd president, I mean yeah, they're all nerds, but this guy is a literal college professor, he was the president of Princeton. and he has a PhD in political fucking theory or political science, whatever they called it by that, he he wrote his thesis on like how congress works, actual nerd ass motherfucker, but yeah he was a racist, he was, he was an he was a wildly hypocritical anti-imperialist who uh loved using american intervention domestically, and honestly his decision to go to war, if you believe some of the more uh provocative thesises about world war 1 that... the us was essentially brought into the war by uh by JP Morgan uh due to the amount of money he'd lent the allies and his fear that it would go unrepaid if they lost there's there's um it's not it's not a totally uh boundless these thesis there's something to it I think so yeah uh and of course you know uh being heller racist pursuing uh segregation of federal uh office building um invading Haiti, invading Mexico, I think invading Nicaragua, and then of course the off absolutely being useless as a fucking uh tits on a bull at versay being a total uh oath who couldn't even get the US to sign on to the lean of nations and then had a fucking stroke and had his fucking wife and his doctor running the country for the last year while they fucking spoon fed him uh strain carrots, come on, uh, the often sanclare book, you mean the book about the campaign that I've been reading, uh, it's called the campaign of the century uh. uh, I'll talk about it on, I'll definitely shout it out on the show because I'm getting a lot of really good details from it, he, it's fascinating because he it's not a conventional history of the campaign, it's a day by day recounting of everything that happened from the day Sincler got the nomination in uh September of 1934 to November uh election just every day and then filling in everything in the back as he's talking so yeah I've seen the attack and and this the stuff that they put together against Sinclair is wild, it was like the entire media arrayed in one way and like even in the world even in the midst of of the fucking great depression, even with the the new deal like stalling, people still saw that that that the entire array of capitalism going against this guy and instead of saying look what they're trying to do, look what look what they're scared of, look what we could do, like why are they doing this, why would they do this? if they weren't scared, it could work, because if it doesn't work, you just take over, in fact, and then you're they've been disqualified forever, and then they're out of power, you never have to worry about them again. lot cheaper that way, but yeah, it's going to be a good episode, I'm going to record it uh, for next week, I'll probably record it like Tuesday, yeah, they basically invented negative campaigning against uh, sinclaire. the they they invented basically every concept that wasn't really done before it but not like i mean like independent expenditures you know pack they basically invented super packs super packs super packs super packs super packs Stave would be a great president, president stavros, let's do it, let's make it happen, let's make it happen, captain. All right guys, I think I'm going to head off, I'm feeling uh, feeling my energy levels dropping, I feel like I've offloaded my Oregon energy onto all of you, so if you don't want to suck some of that up all over through the interwebs and uh be recharged and reborn, I will see you on the flippity flop, I don't know if it'll be back here in the in the in the bunker, but uh it'll be somewhere.
