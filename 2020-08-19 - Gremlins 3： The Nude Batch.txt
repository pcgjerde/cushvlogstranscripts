 so dappled back here, it's always causing a problem. There i am, I'm on the CV, I'm on the television, whatever you want to call it, I'm streaming, 21st century, streaming, who would have sunk it, that's funny, you think about, oh we never got flying cars, you know, we never got moon cities or underwater bubble cities like Epcot. but what do we got instead? we've got Twitch streams, and I'm not saying that to disperage them really, none of that shit's in there, if you think about like all that high-modernist sci-fi, how much time do they spend on entertainment, you know, uh, things like image transmission, the internet, there's nothing even close to the internet in any of that mid-century si-fi shit, but that's because they didn't realize that at some... point uh the deal was going to break down and people are going to have to replace any kind of a meaningful existence with a speculation and interaction with entertainment, so what is shock? that's where all of the actual sci-fi shit happened. instead of having a moon city, i get to sit back here and talk. talk to my phone, my telephone and have thousands of people watch me over the course of uh of the broadcast and its afterlife on youtube, an entirely different uh place to watch videos and that's because if we had moon cities if we'd actually been able to muster that sort of social resource to do that, we probably wouldn't have twitch realistically. we probably wouldn't have gaming as we know it as a culture because it wouldn't be necessary, it wouldn't be compensatory, we wouldn't be needing to compensate for lack of purpose and meaning in the rest of our lives, which were either un undereremployed, hyper-exploited or in in some way uh disenchanted, i mean presumably if you're on the moon it wouldn't be just to be on the moon, it would be the moon to do something to be part of a project, but I'm actually kind of uh, I don't, I'm over, I'm over space travel, realistically, it seems like it's cope, it seems like it's delusional cope by cultures and specifically super rich people to try to imagine that there's some, there's somewhere we can start over, a new America, like oh no, the American concept of of of endless resource uh consumption to offset all social conflict, that's no longer. viable in a closed circuit, it's no longer viable in a world market, it's no longer viable with - with way too many uh, way too much demand put of a biome for for items, for pleasures, for geegaws, for seshwan sauces and the like, for little uh minions eraser tip things, so what if we do to find another one, what if we go find some other new land to conquer a new city on a hill where we get to offload all our social conflict once again by just grabbing what we want, it's not realistic, and more importantly, even if it was doesn't solve anything, just puts it off a little longer, puts off the final conflict a little longer, but that might be worth it if it was even close, but it's so far, get out of that, come on, enough with the moon, enough with Mars, let's uh, let's try to figure out this, I mean, "I don't know how we're going to terraform another planet if we can't keep keep earth terraformed, the planet that was already terraformed when we got here, it was literally terra, and we have managed to unteraform it, that's how fucking bad we are at this shit, you really think we can reteraform an entire fucking planet, it was brilliant indeed, how about you try reterraforming before you start." terraforming somewhere else, okay, chachi, so yeah, like uh, put chips in the heads of all the rich people where they if they if they leave earth's atmosphere their heads explode. I want to ask you guys a question, this is relative to, I god help me, it's a tweet, but I thought this one was one of the rare ones that you can use to to reveal a larger point, and it was something that Jonathan Shate said today, that got a lot of people upset, he was talking about. uh Aoc speech from last night when she uses a lot of intersectional language, the language of like the contemporary left as we understand it online, certainly uh, and someone calls that an outreach to millennial language, it's millennial language, stuff like decolonization and xenophobia and fight and anti-racism, like these concepts, and shade says, I don't think it's millennials, I think it's elite institutions, now that made everyone lose their shit, because they saw the word elite, and I mean shape. dumb ass who likes causing people to get mad at him, so you can't take his word for what he's trying to say, like elite is there too and infuriate people because goddamn it people love bristling over the concept of being elite uh and they hate it and they want to thrust it away like a hot potato because that's the fantasy that allowed America to shred its class consciousness over time is that we is that uh we've made the we've made being common a fetish of even our richest citizens. which makes it much harder to see class as it actually functions in society. but anyway, so you now the number of people i saw tweeting today, well i've just got a degree from a state school and i understand this, i just went to a small liberal arts school, you never have, and you know if you, i'll give people the benefit of the doubt that if you read read, there's a perfectly reasonable argument that if you you read him from what he's trying to say, elite means like iivy league institutions like very... very selective schools and that's not the useful way to talk about it, so fuck that, fuck Jonathan shade, he's an idiot, this is just a chance to talk about something that's real, even though the actual conversation is being had by dollarts, well ignore what they actually said and pull out what is useful that they could have said so that you can actually make something interesting out of it that you could talk about, buse if you stay in the playpen fighting over the words of the actual moron and the meaning of the actual morons words, then you will just be as dumb as they are. so it's the way Trump has made everybody stupider by having to live in the world where his utterrances are your entire daily emotional reactive life. anyway, if we strip the connotation from elite and we talk about like what realistically we're talking about when when because what's what's what what does it mean when what is chate trying to say chate is trying to say it's not millennial as in this this whole group of people it is a subset of that group of people. now if he means elite by like evil league people. wrong, but there is another way of thinking of elite, shoren from class and shoren from the the prestigiousness of the institutions and the ties that relate to them, that is potentially realistic, like do you guys know what the percentage of adults who have a four-year uh degree, minimum, have at least attained a four-year degree is in the United States, what do you think it is, what do you think the percentage of adults with the four-year college degree is, off off the top of your head, don't google it. someone says 30, someone says 15, someone says 35, 25, 27%, as as in 20 in 2020, 20, 27%, that's not how you would imagine if you lived online and talked about politics online, because the people conversating on all points on all of these questions whenever they come up, almost universally are among that 27%, so chate is idiotically and and provocatively and and stupidly bumbling into a real. to culture, to people who didn't go to college, then therefore they are the new ruling class, that's absurd, but it does mean that there is a cultural distinction that has to be talked about when you're talking about all these other questions, because uh, there is this distinct belief among a lot of people that the that the college-based vocabulary of American leftism, all the stuff, all the intersexual shit we talk about, all all the stuff about all the language, of oppression and the language of white fragility and and like racial centeredness all this stuff that you learn in college that it's bad that racism exists and is bad. those are the two things you learn in college uh... uh misoggy is exists and is bad, like that's the one to punch, that's what college, not everybody goes to college has that feeling, a lot of people get alienated by that, because it's so hegemmonic, they get annoyed by it, and they become like the the elite, the culturally elite of the right, or or of like some third position trying to aggravate both because they're so alienated from either, uh, and that they say that that language alienates potential. they're seeing you do this stuff and they're getting mad at you and even though they would love to sign on to socialism, you are making them either turn off completely or turn to conservativism and reaction as a response, and the truth or falseness of that theory can never be tested, because no one involved in the theorizing it is a member of the group. talking about, because all these conversations around like how to talk about subjects and what subjects to focus on, imagine they're creating an imagined non-college educated person, because all the people in the inside this bubble are, whatever their opinions are, members of that subgroup, they're not being observed, or if they are, they can't, no, they're in a black box, because if they were on the other side they would be there, like - reasoning seems to be these poor non-college educated but good-hearted people see you awful people with your awful bitter sectarian wokeness and absurd blaming of whiteness and whatever and making it and then they turn away because that's what i would do if i was in their position but they're not in their position none of us are we are in the bubble and what's going on outside the bubble we can guess at it but we certainly can't have any kind of confidence enough to act from premise and act like, no, no, I need to fight the battles of the internet, I need to joust online with these people, because there's this audience of prols that I'm imagining are there, that's in your head, dude, it's it's just a different version of the same phenomenon in in among liberals, like the reason Biden's the nominee right now, more than anything, and and the reason that there's all those republicans uh at the convention, I mean, yes, obviously it shifts, it it signals the drenderal shift to the right of the democrats over time, but in the in the in the near now like... at the level of like decision making by voters, it's because they don't vote from a position of um, what they want to see, they vote for what they imagine someone else, generally a more conservative person than them because they believe America is a conservative country because of their cultural surroundings, because we segregate by income and by by cultural attainment, and so they say, yeah, yeah, I don't care about Colin Pow, I don't care about John McCain, but some guy, some disaffected republicans. watching might, now he probably doesn't give a shit, but one way or another, it doesn't matter, because you can never know you're not him, you're just putting yourself in that position, but the whole point of them being in a different position is that they're not you, does that make sense? it's all wishcasting, what it is is it's people laundering their own anxiety that they are in a bubble. by projecting out a fantasy of another, woke people do it too, they're their counter, their counter rejoinder is always no, like working class people are basically they're all good-hearted, they're all waiting, they're yearning to be connected to this network of beliefs that i all learn in college and that take a long time to get to for a lot of people because it's counteritive premises, especially from stuff you learn growing up, especially if you tend to be white or male and it takes a while to work through the process, you have to be committed to it, you have to be committed enough to fucking spent four years in a goddamn college and going to debt for the fucking privilege, you have self-selected, you don't know what they're thinking about any of this, you don't know that they're just waiting for some uh some real like son of the soil to arrive, some Richard Jo-Jeda guy to lead them to some unwoke socialist paradise, you have no idea, it's all in a box, and what it does is it allows you to deal with ignore the real problem, the real functional problem that is far beyond any questions of what people are talking about or any issue that is on the agenda or or any controversy or any podcast or anything, it is that there is no connection between these two groups, culturally they are separate, and the majority we certainly know of the non-college educated in this country do not process the alienation and horror of their lives through a political or class lens, which is the only way the class consciousness emerges, and traditionally what made that happen was the close court. that is really the difference when we talk about American exceptionalism, it boils down to the fact that our vastness of land, resources excorporated from natives w not part of our political calculus, could be exterminated, meant that we never created the the the uh the pressured situations or very rarely anyway like in pockets certainly immigrant pockets for example of of the east coast yes, but generally did not generalize a a single working class experience uh and and the class and the class got sort of bleached up of America as distance allowed people to live separately enough that the accumulated experience of living near fellow working class people dissipated and that's the real challenge and instead people would much rather cuuse it's more fun and you can do it online, you can do it in your house, you can do it in your underwear, you can do it while jacking off, you can't do it, it's easy, there's no uh, there's no, there's nothing stopping you, and it's and it's and it's a nice place to dump anxiety. like people say this stuff starts online and then it goes in the real world right, but it can never be stopped online, it can only be stopped in the real world, not all gremlins are nude, that's absurd. Greta Gramlin is never new, she's dressed in delightful silk and fineries, um, somebody asked if Hey Long could have ended the great new deal by by splitting the vote in 1930. I honestly considering FDR's margin in 36, I suspect, and the reality of like the already existing like uh mechanism for redbaiting that was being twirled up by by the powers that be, the upton sinclair campaign in California being like the the the practice run, I don't think he would have stopped FDR from getting reelected. Hover and Biden are very similar because they're both going to be in a position where they're going to be dealing with a presidentated crisis that cannot be handled with any of the available tools that they use their entire careers but with no willingness ability or willingness or ability uh to change them, so something's going to have to break off and and and and and shatter this political uh log jam. Oh boy, so the US, so so it does look like China and Russia are trying to win us off of the dollar. globally, they're they're apparently cutting their uh, their percentage of transactions that they're doing from 90 to 50, and I know China just bought it literally tons of gold, uh, I mean, I still would assume this is hedging, uh, because nothing in the current situation makes me think that China is in a position to make that change right now, uh, but they're very, I mean, they're very wise to have an alternative, like if the if the Greeks had really like it really... taken the concept of of leaving the euro seriously, they could have won, but the thing is that the the Germans knew that they didn't, the the Germans knew that they were bluffing, and since the Germans knew they were bluffing, they were never going to get pushed off their position, even after they won that uh referendum, it didn't change the calculus, and the thing is is that the way to beat that was not to have bluffed, or at least to have bluffed a higher level of commitment as in really making moves towards getting the... goddamn currency going again instead of just saying we might do it in the future if we can't get a deal buse they'll be like yeah no you won't buse at that point it's too late it would be nice if they came back to the drachma because that's a great name one of the best named currencies i would say the drachma is great drachma wonderful the slotti in uh Poland also delightful the dong of Vietnam. how can you not love that? uh, let me think, i always like colones, the the costa Rican currency, uh, ruble is just kind of fun to save, rupie also. Sheckle kind of seems antisemetic honestly, maybe it's just the k in there, it's like a comedy sound that you would use to make fun of somebody who really love money. Lira is very nice and I'm glad Turkey still uses a Lira so that it's still around. Frank is one sounds like you're sneezing, two, typically self-absorbed, oh yes we're french and it's the frank, no shit, fuck off. Kroner is fun. Croner is like all of the currencies in in Europe like that aren't euro are all by like the relatively. high hdi countries that figured rightly that the euro wasn't in their interests like in scandinavia and it's all croders. oh the ask the queetssel in guatemala, that's nice. scudo, that's a good one. dinars are fun, give me that dinaro. i wish this, i wish somebody had the cistersy, the old roman cistersi, i always like that, it was very very... dramatic name for a currency, gilders are good, duckets of course, i have a ton of dinars, somebody sent me a bunch of dinars, so i have if if they do the revalue i am going to be a billionaire, Uh, one thing I don't like about the Chinese currency right, is that it's the Yuan, right? But also it's the remimbi. Pick one, what's wrong with the ruwan? Just make it bewan, get out of here, get out of here, people should need to get over the idea of Aoc running for president, the president's not going to save anybody, we the circuit's broken, it's not going to happen, wish. tasting presidents is just is just learn helplessness at this point. we need to just get over the idea of the presidential. Bernie was different in qualitative way and worth supporting for specific reasons everything else is just trying to imagine you can you can have lightning strike twice and I don't think you can, and when we saw the results with Bernie and the failure to activate that group I was talking about, like Bernie didn't do it, your fucking like argument over a Jacobbin article isn't going to do it one way or the other. uh like some 30 color accounts saying like that it's uh that it's actually abolism not to follow back is not going to fucking have any kind of impact if the fucking presidential if the presidential campaign that had hundreds of like what tens of millions of dollars behind it wasn't able to do the fucking job it's going to have to start from the scratch ground up that does not mean not electoral it means electoral. local level, the only place you've seen any movement anywhere, and that's good, that's where it always starts, well new rights started there, the new rights didn't start with president, very goldwater got his ass shallacked in 1964, but then they won started winning uh town councils, school boards incredibly importantly school boards, local elections and then congress, then they started getting senators and then boom, they got Reagan, they did not start with the president, presidency started moving. things, it was a momentum thing, and that was what Bernie was always supposed to be, so the better he did, the better it would work, that strategy of of activating the movement, like in the core where they get the core of the earth to start spinning again with the nukes, that was what Bernie was supposed to be, and I don't think, I don't think he absolutely failed, he certainly six, 2016 definitely started something, and 2020 continues it, it's just that it wasn't sufficient to do what anyone imagined they were going to do in their head, which for most of the part was delusional, anybody you thought was going to get her universal healthcare pass, i'm sorry was, if they needed to think that to keep going, good, but it was not realistic. the fight was supposed to build a social base for socialism, that was the best we could hope for, and so we got less than that, but we got more than nothing, but it's still that's the process, the idea that you could just put another figure head on top of this process even though it has failed to get into its own you know circulation, it's failed to start the... process, it's failed to kickstart the uh, the perpetual emotion, then it's not going to manner, so if you want to care about elections and I don't think people shouldn't, I think that's silly and childish, then care about ones that can be one at the local level, and I know it's horrible to think of that considering how late it feels, but we have no idea how things are going to break, we don't how things are going to break loose, we don't know what those conditions are going to be, you need all you can control is what position. you are in when those things happen and that means finding the smartest application, the most effective and efficient application of your energies and then applying it so that whenever things change, whenever the the the the the fault lines crack and things start rolling down hill, we're rolling up, then you're somewhere that can meet that moment, and that is the thing that I can't tell you and that no one can tell anyone, that has to come from in them side, they have to clear all the fucking gunk off of their windshield, sit quietly, look at the wife around them for really, instead of just reacting to shadows in their mind, really look at the conditions of their life and move forward, and you say, how will I know, you'll know. but we don't operate at that level, that level of clarity, we operate at this the fogged level where we're always constantly entertaining and and exercising distraction on our own minds in order not to have to make look through that clear pain at what's within and what's without, we would rather filter it through this layer of irony or distraction or or mythic heroistic self-conception or or to carry off social media conflicts with one another that we charge with epic emotional and immoral weight for no reason that's why uh the pale king someone says pale king ours yeah the pale king was about like the spiritual the magical implications of the concept of boredom because boredom is set with if bordum is is actually engaged instead of annihilated. You can get to some pretty profound realizations without anything getting without needing any intervention without needing to to have the right moment appear to you where you get like aha. That happens sometimes, but you can't guarantee it's ever going to happen. What you can do is actually try to be bored for a minute and listen and you might get a little closer to figuring out what to do yourself. someone wants me to rate ab klobacar's feet posts, i will not, i will say is let's dispense with the fiction that amycar doesn't know what she's doing, she knows exactly what she's doing, this is the second foot post she's ever done, this one is clearly intentional, she is like all these people, an attention monster who need whose ego is unsatiably huge, she ran for president for god sakes, so you know that she is aware of every meme related to her, she knows everything about th she knows everything about throwing the staplers and eating with the comb. she even tried to do a horrible disgusting joke about eating with the comb. she's fully aware of everything that's ever said about hers, which means she knows about the her army of simps and she wants to, she wants to throw a little gasoline on that simpfire, and uh, i say more power to her, not hurting anybody, which she certainly would have done much more of if she was vice president, and whatever she's doing in this. senate, which I'm sure is monstrous. Wallersteen, world systems theory, very important, very good stuff. I think it's the only real way you could understand how capitalism actually spreads and interacts first with like different systems of of local uh social order and then eventually spreads throughout them. The capillary action of trade, like building veins that bring blood in and actually change the the the structure of societies. just through prolonged interaction, someone asked what's the deal with feet, i have a theory about the feet thing, uh, i have no idea if it's true, like most of the things i say, it's just something that kind of makes sense to me, and that is that the foot fetish, the rise of the foot fetish, buse like foot fetishes have already always existed, but they've gone from being marginal things like a creep in a James Roy novel with a bunch of shoes in his arms or something to something that is now the... most common fetish and one that is just sort of offhandedly use like if you want to suggest some sort of vanilla kink for a uh for especially a white male character or a male character a straight male character specifically foot is the perfect it's the first one and it's like it's mildly kinky or creepy but it's not full it's like the way that geekiness used to be this actual thing for actual social outcasts and then fucking marvel made it just everybody same thing with the foot fetish foot fetish is the marvel movies of uh of of kinks and the reason for that in my theory is is that the modern a guy who grows up now and has grown up like in the last 30 years has for the first time in history been able to access from the age of uh puberty the age of horney all of the pornography they've ever wanted which in my opinion is a terrible thing and very bad and i feel like uh like i'm of the last generation where nudity was a scarce resource. like i have distinct memories around like videotapes that i owned uh and uh like taping things off cinemax like that kind of thing uh because it was it was scarce, you know, it was an incredibly precious resource back in my day, but of course what that means is, you know, if you're contact with something that you desire is less, then your enthralment of it is not removed, and i think that if you can see like boobs, put it into a computer from 13 and just see every boob on earth, you're going to event, boobs are eventually going to be boring, you have to find another thing, and it has to still be like part of the... body that is in general and in public hidden and nowadays that basically means like ass or feet and then so your brain basically rewires its desire circuit around the dead area where boobs used to be and uh connects it to feet and that's like the process of like being desensitize to pornography that makes guys you know addicted and make it hard for them to have sex. for real is because of that process, that's my theory, i don't know if it's true. i have not, somebody asked if i've read christopher Lash, i've only read uh exerts posted on twitter uh, but i will say that i i wanted to mention him because in Reganland uh lash makes an appearance because when when Carter was really fucked like... Carter was over a barrel with with uh gas lines and inflation, had no idea what to do uh and his numbers were tanking and he could not get anything passed in congress. Pat Cattle, his like uh, his wonderkind polster uh who had helped propel him to the presidency and who later on became like uh, he was like the favorite democrat at Fox News during like I think during the Trump Bush years, he would just come out and talk about how the democrats sucked the... losers uh and trust him, he was the carter guy, you know, but anyway, pat cattle had this like revelation buse he read lash, and oh my god, the real problem with this, the real problem we have here is not the fact that you know gas is incredibly expensive and people waiting in lines for it, or that savings are being destroyed by uh, by inflation and the jobs are going away, deindustrialized and and and all that, it's there's spiritual void at the heart of America and he wrote this huge memo to carter saying we need a letter, we need to address America about its soul, not about its material conditions, and then Carter was blown away by the thing, and he read lash, and then he had lash be read by all of his like top guys, Hamilton Jordan and all those the the Georgia Mafia guys, then and I had no idea this happened, like a month before. i think or so before he did the chris as a confidence speech that it came to be known as, he went to camp david and went off the grid for over a week and had meetings with different groups of of like spiritual and governmental leaders, like you had a bunch of governors to ask them like what's going on in your state? uh, he had a bunch of religious leaders and he had lash, he invited lash to dant david and asked him like what should i say, what should i do, and lash told him and all the stuff about the heart and he's like, well what about like you know what about? energy prices and what about credit and stuff, he's like, i i don't know, uh, and eventually Jimmy has like this satori moment like, i know what i need to say, and he he get, they get together and they write the thing, uh, and when they present it to the press before they going to do the big thing, like they present the idea before they they uh, they had the actual speech, they handed out lash to the reporters at the at the conference, they handed the books out. uh to like give him an idea of like what they were actually going to be going for, and then he gave the speech, which was very well received at the time, it's remembered as him kind of eating shit, but uh, and and like it's it's a emblem of his impodence as president uh, and his lamenes and the way he presidented over a a domestic limp failure, but at the time it boosted his approval rating, uh, but of course, you know, then things happened, fucking gas didn't get any cheaper, inflation went up and the fucking hostages got taken. that didn't help, um, and I just think it's really funny that now you got people like, oh, people need to read lash, people need to read lash, it's like, maybe some of the stuff I've seen is good, I certainly get like the vibe of what he's going for, you know, like the and I do think that narcissism is the condition of of of the self in neoliberalism, it's like hegemonic, everyone's a narcissist, to calling people narcissist is almost banale, because it's the only way that you are, you're rewarded for operating, or that this that the ideology of the world around you makes sense, is the only lens through looking at human contemporary life that comports with what you're told it's supposed to be, so yes of course we're fucking narcissis and that means that we we uh we tunnel blindly towards what we think. is a greater good, that is actually just our own worship of self, and even when we become political, we end up importing that narcissism with us and that undermines our attempts to build solidarity. uh, yeah, that's true, absolutely, uh, but I think it's funny though that at one point in this country, at a crucial hingepoint American history, in fact, the one of the most important, the one that set the this, the one that broke the back of American labor and led us towards hegemonic neoliberalism, the president, the president of the United States and his top advisors had all red lash, and and we ended up fucked and I'm not saying it's because they read lash, I'm just saying that lash didn't help. tom countryman rules, that guy looks like he has seen some shit, you know what he kind of look like, he kind of look like uh the real-life version of uh oh what's his name? oh god damn it, john, the guy soul star from deadwood, what the fuck's his name? john hawks, that's it, uh, he looks like the john, he looks like a real-life version of the John hawx character from winter's bone, uh, terrifying. teard drop, yeah, that's it, it looks like teard drop from fucking uh winter's bone, tom countryman sounds like a like an alien trying to come to earth through customs and just making shit up on their on their head, i tom countryman, hello, i am tom countryman, i would like to be introduced to your country, i love it here, hot dogs and sodies pop, is he really the under secretary of state for international security? oh, he's one of the deep state guys, even like when they got a guy who looks kind of rough and tumble, he still a fucking deep state fucking langly ghoul, amazing, democrats never disappoint. man laura lumer in congress would be great, i mean the funny thing is is that even if she doesn't win and i don't think she will, it's apparently a relative. safe democratic district uh, but hey, it doesn't mean she won't is that she even if she didn't get in, like even if she got in she would not be the fucking craziest person elected, because i think lumer, i don't think she actually goes full q and on, which is not true of the rifle lady, the rifle car uh restaurant lady from colorado or the one from georgia, both of whom are likely to fucking win, they're both nuttier than Laura Loumer, which think about that, just get that in your... head is is on this generation's fry core? what? they're all geriatric senior citizens who are on the computer all day, what? yes, actually, they are this generation's free court because the guys who would have done that then are doing that now. Fry core, yeah, fr e I core, it sounds like Fry, but that is the correct pronunciation, I'm not going to roll my RS or anything, fry corre, it's free corre, oh someone's wants, someone wants to to Monday morning quarterback the soviet, the the the Polish Soviet war, it's one of those, it's that's like - Polish soviet war. is kind of like uh like uh post soviet war is pickets charge for tankies or uh or whatever you want to call them because i think they like that name now i'm not trying to to uh criticized anybody USSR fans, USSR, the version of USSR people, the version of like lost causeers for the for the USSR, they just think oh if they hadn't if they just driven to warsaw, and the funny thing is is if that if anybody fucked that up it was Stalin, which if you're also loving Stalin then you got to figure out a different reason that that war didn't go so good, let me guess it was Strawky. Well the funny thing about people being called revisionists is that I mean if your stances this USSR was was good until Gorbachov showed up well then you're a breshnevite and Breshnev had revised a bunch of shit from even Stalin uh you know if you're if it's like Hungary and check and shit and it's like all right Krushchev he did a lot of fucking revisionism too and Stalin. I'm sorry, revised shit, it's all, it has to be revised, it's a question of what you're revising it to too, the idea that anything can be fixed in time and not applied to the circumstances of the moment, I don't, man, it's not very, what's the word, starts with a d, what's Trotski's whole deal? I would define trotssky's whole deal as a guy who couldn't make the tough call. "a guy who wanted to have ice cream for dinner, a guy who did not want to accept the moral responsibility of being at the center of the historical moment, and that's what the world revolution was for Travski, it was the thing that was going to come cut through the impossible choice, the gordian not and just slice it for him, uh, and since it never happened, he was never able to be effective." and the thing is is that at a certain point if you can't answer the question before you you have to reexamine your premises and like say take uh take the whole question of like industrialization or uh like creating a modus for vendi with peasantry using the market system bkarin versus Zanovia have broadly constrived trotski of course wanted to wrap up industrialized, but at the same time he recoiled at what he knew it would take to get that fucking grain out of those fucking from those fucking peasants, and he didn't want to make the choice, because that choice was never supposed to have to have been made, that choice was supposed to have been abviated by the world revolution following shortly after the martian revolution, both lennon and trotski were operating in October of 1918, from the premise that it would be the beginning of a world revolution, and for a minute it looked like they would, they were, it looked like it would have happened that. didn't happen and they had to improvise from that point, but they could not look back, and that was the problem, like you either have to say, like stalin eventually did, all right, full steam ahead, there's no going back, the history runs runway and this is the moral horror, if this is horrible, it might that doesn't mean it's not necessary, or you go like bukar and you're like, you know, maybe martov had kind of a point, maybe Russia really wasn't ready, in the absence of a world revolution, maybe Russia really wasn't ready for this, and you know this kind of the consolid. stuff like the capital accumulation, that's not really supposed to happen under us, that's supposed to happen, that's that's the dirty hands of capitalism, like our system is not built on blood, the way capitalism will be, that's the whole, that's the whole brilliance of the teleology, the way we what we're acting on, the morals we're acting from, is that we don't have to start a world, the blood we shed will be righteous blood, the blood of revolution, the blood of punishment of criminals, it will not be wholesale exploitation and and and in human instrumental human instrument human instrumentality, because that work will have been done by capitalism, and but that would have required taking a step back and going, maybe capitalism has to come back, which is essentially arguing for, even though he wouldn't say it that way, he was like, look, this fucked up, make a deal with the peasants and this will eventually like dissolve back into something like the bourgeois democracy that technically we all used to think you needed to have before you could get communism, drop all our bullshit, we all used to think that until we decide. we didn't think it anymore because the Germans didn't successfully revolt and then after that we could we couldn't take warsaw and it's you got to make a decision sonoviev and stalin and those guys made theirs buukarin made his, but trosky couldn't make the choice. i think that was Trosky's deal and that's why Trosky is a choice of very educated people because even the thought of making a morally monstrous decision. like acting in the world to be most in sink. yeah, pilot the eva, leon. i i'm talking about discrete choices and and decisions, obviously they're all they're all pre-determined to a degree, but people don't operate from that assumption, they operate from a illusion of free will that actually ends up being the stacastic stamping of space time that propels history forward, you have the shape determined by material reality that is unbending and then you have the... application of actions caused by the deluted human brains operating without full recognition of their environment, it does not, somebody asked does it make considering counterfactuals pointless, it doesn't, because what you're. I think you can't really distinguish, when you're talking about counterfactuals, you should, it should always be in reference to one another, what are more and less likely or possible or realistic counterfactuals and that can be determined by saying what major change could have been caused? what's the biggest change that could have come from the smallest number of people either changing their minds or like randomly dying before they're involved and somebody else replacing? you know like and and and from that you can kind of uh get the the aperture of genuine like choice that any given moment allows the people making decisions. uh Jill Biden man, that's a hell of a speech, I didn't really watch it, I just watched her looking like looking like she was uh, a marry widow honestly, like my husband of 27 years is dead and now I'm back on the town, Dr. Joe. I think she is a lady Mcbeth figure because I don't think someone who really loved their husband would put him through this, because there's no way she couldn't have put her foot down and told and made him not not become president, I mean the guy is is clearly at sea and aware of it, and as such probably very grateful for the few friendly and familiar faces that he sees every day and that ground him and then keep him anchored, if she said I'm not going to fucking go with you on this, you would be terrified, so she's doing it. on purpose because she wants to be first lady or more, maybe she wants to be edeth Wilson, but that doesn't mean that she is not uh a uh a hoty, she's definitely hot, so well done, did Bill Clinton look real or like a deep frake fake man. he sure looked uh, he looked bad, that's for sure, and man all that charisma buse, i mean i've seen the old speeches, and maybe it's just buse there's no crowd, but i think i think it's honestly his life force is is finally draining, the acren chrome has run out, i guess after epstein's death, uh is that he was just sallow and gravely and not, he couldn't inflect anything, that thing really was like a just a fucking it was a funeral where it was a funeral where the... were also uh the guests, like the people doing the eulogy were also the uh corpses, and the people attending were also the corpses, it was just like some sick undertaker just stacks up all of the bodies in the morg and has them all sit in the at the pul at the at the peus and then have one of them stand next to the the the uh the casket and then guess who's in the casket, us we're in the casket, very grim stuff. people are loving this new game fall guys, i've watched it, it looks very easy, i think i do very well, very quickly, you just run, you have a little guy run down a hill, that seems incredibly easy, why would that be difficult? seems like it be incredibly easy, i would, i would win every race. I might pay five guys, I'll definitely play, here's the games we know we're going to play in the very near future uh, follow guys, sure, katamari dimasi, rolling up game, that looks fun, uh, and universal Europa universalis i'm going to play that, i'll say it right now, me and uh trillburn, aka Everet, aka, age of Napoleon, are going to try to create a uh, a unified Italy under Venice, uh, maybe even a continent spanning uh empire, so that's going to be fun, I want to be a universal doge, even. if they have to call me a king in my mind it'll be the doge oh oh yes napoleon total war we should play that too for sure also i want to try to see if i can like max out the ottomans is there a game where you can try to have the mongols take over Europe because that's a thing they actually could have tried, i don't think they necessarily could have succeeded because they would have been too far from the step. all right, looks like crusader kings too, you can try to have a mongol conquest of Europe, i think i'd like to try that. No, no, I know that they didn't uh, they were not stopped in Europe, they could have stayed, but it wasn't profitable, that it wasn't, it wasn't the most useful place to go, they had other ideas, they had other. things are more focused on, but there's a way where like they could have stayed, but I think it would have been problematic retardless. All right, dudes, I'm going to sign off a little early today, keep it frosty uh, and stay hydrated. Bye-bye.
