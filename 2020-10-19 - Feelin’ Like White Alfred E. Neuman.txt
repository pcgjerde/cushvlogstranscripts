 I've got wheels of polish steel, I've got tires that drag the road, I've got seats that selfless sleep, hold my friends and a truck that can carry the heaviest of loads, I got a mind that can steer me to your house, and a heart that can bring you red. and flowers, my intentions are good and earnest and true, but under my hood is internal combustion, power, satan is my motor, satan is my motor, here my motor pur, it's always been a favorite cake song of mine, and uh lately i've been thinking about how truly evocative it is of just the condition. you if you grow up in the middle class, if you grow up last, with with the fading beneficience of the post war American economic boom that we're all slowly widdling away, if you get any glimpse of that, any grab of that, you get a chance to be turned into a a a a person who's better positioned than almost anyone in human history to thrive, to thrive, have the ability with your hands to create a destiny, now of course it is all on the backs of the massive exploitation of others, this is without saying, but within the narrow sphere of the personal, you can feel like you have some control of the world, because you know you have access to capital, the lingua franca of the world, access to its markets, its beneficience, a introduction into a bourgeois, social uh network that is embedded and that provides you with like a real identity uh that that uh acts as a social capital that can make up for a deficit in actual access to capital, you're in as good a position as you could be, you are, you get the best of like secular uh uh um education, you get the ability to live a life well-lived without having it constrained by oppression and happen stance and conscious alienation, and yet the engine, the motor of all of that. is this poisonous self-conception, this uh imagined singularity called you know your ego, and this the satisfying of it, because you can't satisfy your ego, it can only ever just be fed from outside uh in the form of desires that are given to you to want and which. make you take your beautiful car and drive it all over the fucking road in any way, just drive you away from from truth, because that the the the motor is the devil, um, so Jeffrey Tuban took his dick out, huh, and was jacking it, is this what happened? He took out his penis and was jacking it during a uh an election simulator you say, interesting. I guess that's just the peril of the modern workplace. Am I right? Folks, COVID, hm, just to think, if it hadn't been for COVID we wouldn't have had that little hilarious uh story to all enjoy, so maybe it was all worth it, might as well look in the bright side. Jeffrey Jeffrey's tube man. I do wonder how many people get off on being nude during zoom calls though from the lois down or something cuuse you'll never know and that's probably appealing to some people especially since zoom calls are so deadening and and you know they they they further alienate the work day by making even your place of you know your your home uh kind of a constant office and getting rid of any private distinction like being able to assert any independence of that is going to be pleasurable maybe in some extent and maybe if you really concentrate on it sensually thrilling so I wonder what percentage of people do zoom calls uh pantsless uh I am wearing pants I I have i have shown myself to wear pants in previous streams in which i was moving around, so i think that the benefit of the doll could be extended uh that i am in fact wearing pants, but honestly really, what's the difference if you think about it? especially since you never know who else is pantsless, you sort of have to just leave it to fate and just act like nobody is pantsless, or act like everybody is pantsless, whichever makes e easier for you to engage with them as fellow human beings. i will say that uh, i'm not going to talk too much more about that good lord bird show, but i did watch the third episode where they go meet frederix douglass and it just seems very obvious to me, the whole thing just seems very very surface. i mean i don't really see what it's it's like a lot of shows now it just feels like the twitter high sensibility expressed visually in a different context like here's sort of the hive mind of like the twitter received liberal left wisdom that all of the creative class to make all the stuff marinates in what is that what would that be and then they show hey what would that be when you're talking about the civil war and and and slavery or John brown or what about if you're doing uh you know uh rich people in the current moment like succession which is another show like this, it's just is reproducing sort of the received wisdom of of online left liberals, and that's just not interesting more than anything, it's dull to me, because I can see where everything is going, I'm not going to be surprised or challenged in any way, I'm just going to have myself affirmed, but that's what people are looking for an art now, as we've had to settle for the swill of like this mass produced. television which is just getting worse as a medium while it becomes more hegemonic over everything and film itself is destroyed as a as a fucking genre and turned into just another type of streaming television programming and i don't i don't need that i don't i don't want to just see it reproduced and barfed at me like a baby bird which is uh which is what we're getting. Yeah, we can't get any middle round movies, so we get middle brow TV shows, but then the everything becomes that, that's the problem, it's like it's the middle brow film turned into an entire, the entirety of art really, and I got to say that guy, the je the the jeff, the the uh, the guy plays Thomas Jefferson on Hamilton, who they got to play Frederick Douglas who have seen. a bunch of things, i just don't like that guy, he's just not uh, he just doesn't have, he's one of those guys who just, i hate to use the word soy, because people get people think, oh you're winking to the all right and you're creating a fash pipeline, but god help you, it is a useful descriptor of a certain sort of affect that you see with people, with guys, trying to sort of accommodate the more, you know feminized public space of this moment uh and and it's like it's not bad, it's not evil and it doesn't mean you're brainwashed but is a certain sensibility, and this show, it's like at that point a character like that exists for like a soy infusion, because that character, Frederick Douglas is the imagined creators of the show, like John Brown is is is removed from us by his faith and his the distance of his worldview from us. Frederick Douglas is a more worldly man and we can image ourselves in his shoes, so he becomes the stand in, so of course he embodies all of those characters. sticks, Ethan Hawk is a Trump supporter, damn, that's a zig when I didn't think it would have been a zag, hell yeah, that's pretty funny, I think you, do you mean uh, he thinks John Brown would have been a Trump supporter, because I don't think that Ethan Hawk is a noted Hollywood lib. I'm being gaslet in my own comment section again. I don't know why the hell I talk to you people. No, I don't think soy is homophobic because it's not about, it's not about anything having to do with sexuality, it really is about like um, like a performance of uh, non-threateningness, and like if that gets coded as gay, that's just that's just that's not, that's not a first order intent, if it's if it's there, it's it's it's not intentional on my part. We love our tivo folks, we love tivo, we love it, we love tivo, folks, you go, and you get all the shows, you get every show, all of them, you know, I got to say uh, the guy who's uh, who post who people all found his? uh his Trump impression, the guy on uh twitter, man, it's really good, and it actually watching that, it uh, that's what reminded me, actually, yeah, mine is terrible, shit, it's like not even close, it's brutally terrible, buse that's an actual good one, and I'm like, oh fuck, mine's not even close to that, terrible, I'm embarrassed to myself now, I will stun by my accents though, damn it, the accents are still good. Velma and I am better than Adam Baldwin who is terrible and we love it don't we so we love to do the trumpy we love a trump we love. So uh, I do wonder how many uh, like uh, cous and assassination attempts the CIA never got to run because they couldn't get Trump to sign off on them because he was too busy drinking milkshakes, how, it's amazing. amazing he might be like a genuine like Mr. Bean, like an anti-imperialist Mr. Bean who's just going around destroying accidentally all of these like finely woven uh clockworks of intrigue and and deep-state para political power and he's just smashing it up without even knowing it like Mr. Magu in a construction site, but of course people say, ah, you're you're saying he's a dove or something. No, no, no, he's, he's got incoherent nationalist uh, leanings, he could have definitely be brought into war, except for his individual narcissistic terror of losing and being seen as a loser, which is what stopped him from ever doing any big military action, like when they wanted brinksmanship with Iran, what pulled him back from the brink was that he didn't want to get owned, because he had owned Jeb about the Iraq war, and he was like, why do I think it wouldn't happen again, and that's what stopped. that from happening, i mean it doesn't necessarily mean there would have been a war, but he pulled back from the brink at several moments where presidential decision making is crucial just out of a naked fear of being made to look like a loser, loser folks, and you know if that speaks to anti-imperialism, it's just that um, it's just the anti-imperialism of his like narrow focus as a totally self-centered ego maniac, looking through a totally personal lens. and recognizing the weakness of American power, which maybe it's you know planners are less concerned about, because they know it doesn't matter if they win, it doesn't matter if every politician has this around their neck forever, uh they still get their war, that's what matters, they don't give a shit who takes the electoral political flack uh for when it goes bad or what doesn't get its objective, as though there's ever an objective other than just maintaining the fucking war, that's the objective and expanding it. changing the terrain, disrupting the enemies, maintaining revenue streams, but Trump is narrowly focused on this re-election, which is the similar reason that Obama kind of rained in uh, is Syrian uh intervention, I know there was a ton of US Syrian intervention, but the deep state, the blob was clearly much more intent on pushing farther than Obama went, and uh, in the most. cases like the difference there from a democrat and a republican is fear of electoral blowback for the their narrow short-term interests from the American people in general due to there the fear that they have an inate hostility to failed American military ventures because they don't want to see people getting blown up for no reason in foreign countries because they don't get a benefit from it at least not nearly directly enough to feel it as anything other than continual loss and and and humiliation and trauma and waste for and whether that's because they're animated by some international spirit that says that those people are just as much as uh right to life as I do and that they're suffering. as mine or if it's just narrow focus on the idea that there's a limited amount of resources and we shouldn't waste them on other people, one way or the other, i don't care if it's blown them up or given them schools, that's money and and men and resources that we need here right now, whatever it is, whatever strain of uh uh like moral calculus gets you to the point, there is this majority that wouldn't like it, and it's sort of the only millstone around the neck of the of the deep state, but it doesn't stop the drive that underlies it because at the political level, there's never enough of a organized opposition, an articulated opposition to the very existence of the thing, and uh, sadly Biden is not going to change that at all, the good times are going to keep rolling for the for the for the draculas of the military industrial silicon valley entertainment fucking complex, Rathion, Disney, Amazon. I did see Sodom's chave, but it was a long time ago, I should watch it again, I'd be interested to see, I remember liking it a bit. somebody's banging in a dang drum is it seven? no, it's six. i'm seeing the Chicago 7 movie tonight, we are going to be doing an episode on thursday, that was inevitable. apparently it's rich with liberry goodness and sorkiny nuggets, it's got all of our favorite things, it's got all of the specific sorkin idiocy, it's got more general. illusional like boomer nostalgia and and uh misunderstanding of the of the 60s, it'll be interesting, we're going to hopefully talk to uh Dave Anthony and Josh Olson from the West Wing thing podcast who talk about Soorkin every week to talk about it, that'l be interesting, especially since apparently like they like the new left guys a little more than I think I do, and I know Amber does, so there might be some sparks there, we'll see, but I'm... sure i've heard it's terrible and that makes me very excited cuuse there's nothing i like more than a bad movie with very high production values and a lot of good actors in it ooh that's some of the best movie watching you can do is a just a bad like uh in some way like risable film that's got a nice rich patina on it especially since there's so much there's so little content these days in terms of streaming that it seems to pop out and thing just seems like a slurry, we love our actors, don't you folks? oh man, berry, that barry seal movie, that was amazing, that's like a fucking definition of a limited hangout deal where they talk about barry seal and they say that they say yeah sure, the the CIA hired him to run guns uh illegally uh into... to uh Nicaragua to arm the contras during the Iran Contra scandal, yeah they he did that uh, but he also and he also while he was doing that uh was moving a lot of cocaine for Pablovar into the United States at the same time, and maybe the CIA knew about it and look the other way, but most of the government didn't know about it that... the official and that's perfect example of a limited hangout because there is the the the horror of oh my god like they're they're they're giving these guns these drug dealers are arming these terrorists on behalf of the us government that's amazing but the idea that the CIA is directing the flow of fucking cocaine into the United States in order to fund a fucking terrorist war in central America genocidal fucking attack uh no absurd. where'd you get? no, look, we're telling you as far as it went, he did move drugs while he was moving the guns and we made it to look the other way, but you know at the end of the day he was just a an American boy. wanted to do good, and you know what, the fact that he was so ambitious about everything and just wanted money so much, doesn't that just really indite the entire American system after all? aren't we all to blame? move those crack rocks, meanwhile you're moving crack rocks, you're turning shit, you're turning pieces into weight and then back into rocks after having basically created the mod heroin trade during Vietnam, and then in Afghanistan, you went from having a situation where the taliban had been very successful in eradicating opium production and it brought into like into near extinction, like it was on the path towards eventual uh extinguishment, and then the US showed up after uh 9:11, and after that moment, from that moment on, not till now, uh Afghanistan has gone from something like in the single digits or or like I think under 25% I believe of world opium uh production to 90 like oh wow we just we couldn't do anything other than let that happen like these huge networks of of uh fucking you know uh extremists and guns and uncountable amounts of untraceable cash. just going to go out of the country without the us having any idea where it's going, oh god, Charlie Wilson's war, another sorken bomb, we am honestly, the show goes long enough, we might end up doing every sorkin property because I think we've talked about doing a Charlie Wilson's War episode, but we never got around to it, it is absolute dog shit, now. not just from the standpoint of its awful typ like it's another limited hangout deal, oh we armed the modin, oh weren't we stinkers? um, and then oh man, taliban exists now exists, darn, fumbled a ball in the end zone, guess what we get for being too cocky, but sorkin dialogue terrible, philip cemer hoffman is the only good thing, he's he's great as a pissed off CIA guy who by the way uh was one of the guys who helped administer the fucking uh the the military. too in Greece that led to a wave of disappearances and torture, but the action and the directing also dog shit, it was like Mike Le Mike Nicholls in his like sineissance when he was just making these boring fucking TV movies and it's got this amazing, the only action scene in the entire movie, spoiler alert is is a shot of some muujidin uh shooting down a hind helicopter with a stinger missile. that had been provided to them courtesy of representative Charlie Wilson in the operation cyclone and it's just these two guys in sandals and and headdresses standing on a rock that could have been a fucking Griffith Park and then they cut to what looks looks uncanly like stock footage of a soviet helicopter and then they get back to the guy and he fires the missile it looks like an SNL sketch and then they cut to and more footage that swear to god looks like it's uh stock of an exploding helicopter and then they go, yay! dog, shit, it's bad, a few good men, i say is is his best stuff, a few good men is an unimpeachably solid film, i would i would not really want anything else out of that movie, and you know it's also one of his first films, it's one of his first chances he had to to uh show off all of his tricks and shit, and I think the fact that it's a different context and it's different actors that is subsequently used over and over again, you can kind of enjoy the sorken stuff uh without it hitting your ear wrong because it's not reminding you of the 500 other times he does that same thing cuz he has three fucking tricks in his sleep, but it's still I think it's entertaining, and Rob Ryner who's certainly nothing more than a journeyman at best uh is pretty confident directing it. and of course Nicholson is fantastic. I have more responsibility than you could possibly fathem. What's so funny about that is that he gets up on his high horse about this shit and this is in the 90s though and this really goes show how America was grasping towards the cold war without even knowing it. how we needed to reestablish like the the threat matrix of an external enemy like the soviets for our entire defense posture and our relationship to our... to make sense like we have to find a new one because this is the end of the cold war and fucking uh nicholason has this giant stemwinding speech that's supposed to like cut to the quick and make you question your assumptions as a pious liberal uh and it comes down to i'm afraid the cubans are going to get me even though i'm hanging out in a fucking uh i mean it is a post-ward where America is the dominant hegemon of the entire globe everybody else is either building themselves up or putting back the pieces together and this got the they're colonial outpost uh in front of like a coud economically sanctioned priya state that we've like waged unceasing war on for sev 50 fucking years he's they're going to five i sleep 200 yards from 500 cubes who are trained to kill me it's like yeah they're going to come over the fucking wire any day now it's it's it's it's absurd in the moment but like our culture didn't have time 9/11 showed up just in time to like catch the foot as we were spinning off into nothing, like catch us on the next rung of the ladder, move us along, oh good, now we may now the world makes sense again, buse for a while there we were in a real fucking uh uh personality crisis, we were real crisis of identity there, uh and 9/11 came along, either because it was an inside job and it was the state making it happen or because we were literally just driving into it as a culture subconsciously because of our like zard as ask death to to find meaning at the end of history, because we've been so deeply cultured to this baracks mentality and this apocalyptic framework of confrontation, that our institutions could not survive becoming decadent, we could not survive the end of the punic war any better than the roman republic could, and now we find, oh no, this replacement has only accelerated the process, because the process was always accelerating, it was just disguised by some freak moments of - unprecedentedly um ill distributed capital accumulation after world war iiwo pubic war indeed indeed indeed sir the pubic war yeah because the alternative to that uh apocalyptic confrontational framework is a clind down from our position at the head of this thing, a chance to put the gun down and like close our eyes for a bit and have and step down from our position as this global globus striding hegemon and also as the consumer of last resort and the and the primary uh just mouth and that means like not not a not a drop in standard of living if you're talking about a like redistribution of of wealth if wealth is genuinely redistributed you could... eliminate profit and replace it with public welfare in a way that reduces any kind of like felt material deprivation, even if maybe there aren't many toothpastes you can choose in the fucking aisle, it wouldn't matter buse you wouldn't care, because you'd have other things, like fucking healthcare, like roads you could drive on, like uh some sort of guarantee government income slash job program, i know those things are always fighting each other, i don't know, you guys figure it out, those things could be achieved. well like allowing other countries to uh to absorb like a a redistribution of you know of economic activity and we never had the political constituency for that because by the time the crisis came our political system was holy subsumed into a totally separate class of humans like a a that has almost no real participation from the working class at this point and that reestablishing that connection is has to be paramount uh someone asks if i will carve a a jan jacco lantern this year i already have sir. It's spook tacular, it makes me want to do a twitch uh, can you watch like old movies on twitch? do like a twitch halloween like movie night be like a sven gouli type guy like a local uh like hey welcome to chapo Halloween theater, that might be fun, I might do that later, we'll see if we'll see if I can get a night. I would definitely need Chris for that one though, night of the living dead for many years was public donain, I don't know if it still is though, there was a while where any publisher of any like VHS company whatever could just put out a... an addition of the night of the living dead with any kind of aspect ratio they wanted or film. Romero is pretty pissed about that. Although I got to say the fact that he lost living in the in the copyright divorce with his co co-producer, I think it was to his benefit because dawn of the dead, day of the dead, I just feel like those are punchier than Night of the living dead, now knight of the living dead is perfect, but I just feel... like day of the living dead just doesn't have as much punch as day of the dead or dawn of the dead most of all, dawn of the dead. Mally's game is not bad. Mally's game is very sorkinny, but it's also zippy and entertaining, and one of the things that makes it fun is that the stakes are very low. I mean, obviously he tries to build up Molly as a world-bestriding genius because he has to, because it's his protagonist, and he can't doesn't care. about a protagonist unless they're as smart as he thinks he is, which means they have to be world geniuses uh, and uh, it's got the snappy dialogue, and it's just about her, like her life, if she's going to go to jail or not, there's nothing about the fate of the republic, there isn't, there aren't even like a lot of grand standing around around like civil liberties in in regards to the FBI uh prosecution uh, and that made it reminded me that he's he is. just he's he understands rhythm and stuff and and what makes like dialogues surface appealing to people, what makes it smooth, even if it's you know not realistic, but man, he gets up his own ass. i watched cube halloween, it was kind of cute, there were so many callbacks to the old happy Madison films, it was like, ah, i feel like this is my like dying dream, like i'm dying and for some... reason as my brain is exfixiating, the last part of my memory that's getting accessed is all of my collective experience of watching happy Madison programming and it's turning into this film in front of me that's suffused with elements of all of it and I'm like turning all of these elements into imagine people in my past as I like bid farewell to this plane of existence so it's fun. uh the 90s version of night living dead is interesting because it really does it changes the the source material in a provocative way uh because it switches things from in the original night of living dead there's barbara and uh Dwan Jones uh the protagonist the hero uh and then the family with the bald creep and his uh his uh uh his pushover wife and their little sick kid uh and in the original Barbara is basically cantonic the whole time and gets eaten by the zombies pretty much immediately when they burst into the house uh and uh the hero dway jones she shoots the dad the mom gets killed by the girl and then even though he survives the night when he goes there's out to look at what's gone in the morning, spoiler alert to a movie that's 50 fucking years old uh a local possy of people hunting zombies shoots and kills uh oh snap in the remake the Tom Savini directed me remake Barbara sort of is gets is the main character who over time kind of comes into her own and uh she escapes like i think joins the passi or something comes back to the house uh uh the hero has been zombified but the dad is still alive uh after being a craven piece of shit and she kills his ass so it's more of a girl boss version it's more of a girl an empowerment version a feminil feminist retelling the special effects are very good it's Tom Savini but it just doesn't feel necessary other than other than that you know inversion Tony Todd's good though. Do I ever wake up with music in my head often? i i'll go sometimes a week or so with the same song and it'll just get stuck there like at the beginning like at ground hawg day and with uh i i got you but eventually it just stops but yeah i'll have it happen a lot i uh i watched the cats movie recently and i got the uh the Mr Mustaffali song stuck in my head for a couple days there that one that one got wedged in real good. Yeah, there's no cat more, I think I forgot it now, there's no cat more more dastardly, what is it? Never was a cat, never was there ever, yeah, that's it, never was there ever a cat as as pimp as uh, Mr. Amistaphales, I think that's it. I actually found uh cats is obviously I think bad from a dramatic perspective, I mean obviously the content is bad uh, it's just these dumb cats introducing each other for fucking uh 90 minutes, I mean that's it, they're just hey, I'm this cat and it's hey, I'm this cat, that's all it is, there's no structure, there's no story at all, it's barely even there, it's just an excuse for the songs, so it's all about how good the songs are, some of them are pretty good, some of them suck, the big most famous song from the thing in my opinion is awful, and I hate memories, one of my least favorite songs on earth. uh thumbs down to that one uh, but some of the other ones are fun, the skimble Shanks song, um, of course the McCavity song, you know, they're not bad, I really hated the the whole thing, really hated the whole thing with uh, with Rebel Wilson and the dancing uh um cockroaches, grotesque, uh, Kafka ask in a bad way. Bustover Jones, revolting, thank you for reminding me of something I black out of my head, definitely the low point of the film, was the introduction of the disgusting, simpering creature known as James Corden, uh, just subsuming the screen and his el genious uh simpering uh face, uh, terrible, terrible. he is one of those brits who they just give us and say here you take him now like a cursed amulet like that trampoline that uh he's like that trampoline that Homer gets from uh crusty and when he goes to take it back he takes out a shotgun and says keep on driving that's what happened with Corden we tried to send him back and the brits were like nope we were sended his visa he's yours now and it's like I guess we'll put him on late night disgusting awful man simpering oath talent voice. but yes, thumbs down to the odious bustofer jones, boo to the odious busted jones. Maccavity is truly not there, it's true, it's true, so oh, this is one thing I wanted to clear up, so the uh, the hard done by outcast cat, Jennifer Hudson who plays, sings the terrible uh showstopper and is given the the the uh... she's she's taking to she's taken to gellical carousel at the end and put on a a a fucking hot air balloon that's just a eupumism for her being killed right like being put down by like maybe the pound comes around or like somebody has to get kicked out of like the warm spot and freeze on the street she's dying right it's it's it's euthanasia i talked about uc someone wants to talk about Bolivia I i said my piece on Bolivia. uh on the show today, it'll be out later tonight, good news for once, and for anybody who says cynically, and I know that the instinct comes to me to think it, this is all, this is only happening because Mas has been uh in some way disciplined, the message has been seen sent and that ensures that there will be further, there will be compliance in the future, and you know what, there was certainly an element of that, to some degree, they wouldn't have, they wouldn't have, they would have pulled out more stops, I think if there was a real threat that they thought uh, that that uh mas poseed existential you know danger in any way, but uh, but at the same time they only had to, they still had to give power back because of popular pressure, and that means popular. pressure is still sufficient to advance like a unified interest uh in the face of all of the entrenched institutional deep state shit and the connections to finance and and global uh capital and that you know as conditions change that power can be advanced forward especially because you got this victory under your belt like everything everything is double edge sword all all events have potential for disaster and an equal measure of of uh of triumph and only time will tell seems like a cop out, but it's the only way to engage with the moment earnestly and in good faith when it happens instead of just writing things off because you've already made a decision that can't be made until uh conditions materialize. uh, is castro a contender for all-time chat? you know, I was talking to brendon James about that the other day, and I think that was exactly what we said, I think we actually said Castro has to be the chad of history, at least, at least modern history, you know, the condition, the the industrial condition, how do you get more chat that, you're you're a fail son lawyer who uh, who has... an absolutely failed attempt a revolution, just a ridiculous adventurist uh action that makes you gets you in jail where you could very easily have been executed, but instead you give a historical stem-winding uh prison oration that gets you essentially commuted sentence and then you go to Mexico and then you borrow somebody's boat and come back and go into the mountains and take over and overthrow the government from that position and then look in the face of the... the continent bestriding hegemon that it determined the fate of your country's politics since 1896 and uh 1898 I'm sorry uh and just say fuck off and then survive for 50 years of constant assassination attempts and undermining efforts and meanwhile to like establish a system that is rooted enough in some sort of social project that it was stands the fall of the Soviet Union. which which very few other socialist states could uh and then also the death of castro himself, the the guy was supposed to charismatically hold the whole thing together, it's it's it's mindblowing, and then you know just baseball player, cigar, fact that he just had an instinctive understanding of how not to get killed by the CIA, which which scuba suit not to wear, just know that it's the one that doesn't have the fungus on it that's gonna make you choke to death in the water, so that when when the woman is sent by the CIA to kill you, you seduce her and then get her to confess that she's there to kill you and give her a gun and say go ahead and do it, and say you can't do it, because no man can kill me, come on, chat, well, I think the... between Tito and fidel can be in part shown by the fact what happened after each of them die uh and and after communism fell he had an ability to withstand uh he had created he had helped coordinate the creation of institutions that were durable in a way that the ones created in uh yugos or not, but I will say that yes, one thing that Tito had to deal with, which uh, caster did not is, is the whole ethnicity problem, which is a real deal, like it wasn't entirely ginned up cynically by guys like Milosevic and Tushman uh after the fall of Soviet Union, it was certainly in part, but it had been there and it had been simering. I mean the the Ustaja really did that shit in World War II, like that's not made up, like the the fucking check uh the croats did a genocide, they they out nazid the nazis, yes, that's the funny part, they all hate each other, but they're all just turkish, I don't understand why all these turks are mad. each other, I hope nobody murders me because I said that. yeah uh the the star. were the were the uh the guys who were most with the the catholic church was most directly involved in uh in helping to flee Europe after world war i was called the rat line it was a joint operation of the uh the catholic church and the oss to get the high level ostasia guys including antevlik the head dude out of Croatia and into Latin America it's pretty wild I can see why there's hard feelings there. And then of course she had like the civil war between like the chetnics and the and the communists and spider network indeed, that's real stuff. I did like Siriana, Siriana was a was a good movie, it was one of the few uh Hollywood products of the of the Bush era that I think hold up analytically in any way, I mean obviously it's very on the nose and sort of on its sleeve and and simplified in many ways, but you know it's got a a kind of social realist uh uh charm to it. and Klooney's very good in that as well, that and that and Michael Clayton are my favorite cluny performances, I think, besides, oh oh, besides the stuff of the kins, all of which I love, I love all of his stuff, he's he's they're so good getting getting the the the idiot out of him, I will say this about Kluny, Klooney has obviously made bad movies and he is you know in his conviction. in aesthetic preferences, he is a very stayed uh uh, you know, lib, like clearly, you know, the bogist of standard libs you could get, and therefore not terribly interesting when he sets out to create like uh self-conscious works of art, like all of his directorial efforts and stuff, they're mediocre at best, but I will say this about the guy, one thing you can say about as a measure of a a-list actor's commitment to you, actually trying to be a... an artist in some way, any way you can in that world, it's directly related to how often they play cops, and it's not because of any ab a cab bullshit or worrying about copaganda, it's just because police officer is the most boring bog standard job you can have in a movie, and movies where the protagonistt is a cop tend to be boring and fog standard in some way, because that's like the the default. thing is hey he's a cop doing x and then you have imply drama and action it's like it's it's just a big bowl of ice cream for everybody always and so if you're always a cop it's like you kind of don't really care about anything other than what people are going to want to watch uh and cluney has almost never played a cop i think the only time he's played an actual like the closest thing to a cop was when he was a marshal in um a US marshal a desk just guy though uh in um burn after reading, so I'll give him that, like look at a guy like Bruce Willis on the other hand, he basically only plays cops, just just shoots half those movies while in his trailer, so I'll give I'll give Cloonie that, I think he's still trying to do work even if his instincts aren't that great, there's intention behind it, which hey is not true of most of those guys. so i'll give him the glad hands tm lexg, yeah i would like to get tuban to do some uh some supreme court analysis maybe we could get him in a he could we could have him come out in a judge's robe that's cut off right above here so it's actually just sort of like a judge's tank top and you can see he's winning the pooing it Oh yeah, klony is also a big propagandist, I believe he actually like... like funded the creation of a uh satellite to like uh hover over Sudan to prevent the Sudanese from doing any more genocides which I'm pretty sure it's like part of some rube goldberg contraption of like neoliberal clamp down in Africa like some like it's part of the spoke of some like surveillance wheel that's part of you know the mali uh uh installations and and like you know the special operations headquarters in jibuuti and the fucking predator war in Somalia and all that shit uh but they're all they're all reptiles of course the their morals are shit I'm talking about I'm talking about the product. I'm talking about the product, you fucking people, we've gotten to the point where the personal is political has been so absorbed and the idea of the Graham Chian cultural hegemony being like the soul vector of reinforcement of capitalist relationships that we get we can't think in any terms other than uh ideologically. oh the best halloween candy, certainly not candy corn, which is disgusting uh and vile, but of course if it's on a table, i will eat it, if it is presented to me, it will be eaten by me, and i will at least one occasion, maybe two, give myself vampire fangs, that will happen, but i will not like it, i really, i got to say guys, i don't know if i like candy anymore, i think i ran out of candy love, i mean i kind of got i got gentrified taste now, like as soon as i got my first taste of like a a dark chocolate covered almond, like that's delicious, i want that, i don't want, i don't want hershies, it's it's just too, it's clony, i'm afraid i'm a sophisticate now, i'm a dreaded member of the PMC Grifter overclass, which means i must have the finest sweets, get the $4.99 tub of traders Joe uh salt salted dark chocolate covered almonds. thoughts on garabaldi uh pimp, what other word do you want to describe him with uh like you could say that like John brown was like the American Garribaldi uh and Garbaldi just was operating in in a little better uh tactical environment they both they both had problematic age gaps in their relationships though and i would say to my Italian american brothers and sisters that if you really have to have a day, you really got to have a day for your people, uh, fine, how about gerbaldy, he's right here, hey, he's a better, what's the wrong with him, huh? he's a good, i mean, he's the guy actually created an Italy in the first place for you guys to be italian around, and i know the idea is like will columbus like is the American part, but again, not united states of america, a concept of America that they don't. at all in their self-concept as Italian Americans, it's an entirely different national identity from anything columbus did, yeah, and garibaldi did go to, he was in Argentina doing fucking revolutionary banditry and shit, yep. but I honestly don't know why the Italians need a guy, I mean who else has a day, the Irish have a day, I guess it's whoever was in, whoever was in the big ethnic east coast machines that like ran the democratic party for a while, that was their version of identity politics. That was the identity politics part of the material, the car the material and cultural case uh for the Democratic Party in the 20th century was, yeah, we give you patronage jobs and... suburban houses with union benefits and also we give you a day for your people, like just imagine FDR like old Patrician Blue Blood FDR going, yes, yes, would you guys, would you people like a day, perhaps, they get to be like, yeah, we're part of the team, we're part of the ruling class, it's like, yeah, sure you are, buddy, that's perpetuating false consciousness, it's a deebious game. but germans don't have a day, i mean October fest doesn't count, I'm sorry, and it's what it's just cuuse we fought a couple world wars against them, I'm sorry, but they make proportionally the largest percentage of like European extracted Americans, now uh, the whole thing is, I don't care about it either way really, it's just kind of a thing that what's one of those things. have a hard time getting my mind in the getting myself in the mindset of yo god how about an English day where we just eat disgusting potted meats how about that? 4th of July is the opposite of a British holiday, I guess technically because the people who did it were of British citizens, sots on the carbonari, I'll tell you right now, I could go for some chicken carbonari, sounds delicious. Someone keeps asking me about nicotine, what, why, how would you have me profitably discourse on nicotine, it's an addictive substance that is utilized in the sale of a tobacco-based products. They are a drug that has been successfully synthesized it's uh market has been successfully synthesized into the workings of uh the above board capitalist economy unlike drugs like marijuana or cocaine or what have you scheduled narcotics but is essentially the same thing as a scheduled narcotic in terms of its market. i i know i shouldn't respond when people just kind of respam comments, but that one was baffling just because it seems so left field and i was hoping maybe there'd be a follow-up, but it doesn't look like i'm getting a follow-up. it looks like once again i am lashed to the mast uh eternally to be tormented by the pelican-like shreaks and pecks of my demented followers. as they fail to engage me in good faith on my twitch streaming platform, instead finding it humorous to distract me with non-secular questions and trolling and also mistrues that lead me on uh wild goose chases but I understand, my uh, the twitch stream is sort of my instant karma, you know, it's like I'm getting back everything I put into the world as it happens. I know that's not technically accurate, but that's how it feels. All right guys, I think I'm uh, I'm done for the day, maybe one more question, before I say goodbye. horror movie, I'm going to say uh, a movie that I just went on my uh, your kickstarter sucks to talk about with uh Jessie and uh, and at dog. owner, i love that, i love that handle, uh, return of the living dead, halloween classic, you can't go wrong with that one, speaking of films that came out of the Ramero. uh the branch off the ramaro tree of zombie films, great film, check it out, wonderful mix of horror and comedy, wonderful effects, great performances, the wonderful James Karen, we left to see him, and folks, here look donfa, it's dfa, folks, look at him, he's already called bruner, he's the more tradition, okay, he cuts up the bodies and also look at this, he's a nazi, he's a nazi martician, it's crazy, folks, you wouldn't believe it was happening, but you got to watch it, it's right there, send more paramedics, hey America, hey world, send more paramedics.
