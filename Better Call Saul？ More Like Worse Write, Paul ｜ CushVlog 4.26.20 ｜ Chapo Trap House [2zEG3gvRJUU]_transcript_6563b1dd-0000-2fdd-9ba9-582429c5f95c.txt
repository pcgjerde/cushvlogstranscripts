 wonder if there's a spot i can make a desk or something here, well i guess i'm gonna have to hold it, i could put it in here, maybe i don't know, i'll figure out a way, hello, hello everybody, oh hello friends, trying to get this so it's relatively comfortable, hello friends, uh, so yesterday uh, i don't know if anybody watched the stream i did lasterday uh, i was kind of trip balls uh, and at the end of it i had at the after i finished recording, i sat in my little back area, my little fenced in area, and i look up at the sky for a while, and uh, wouldn't you know? I ended up having one of those legitimate like full-blown satori moments, actual enlightenment, actual transcendence, like one second, one with the universe, whatever you want to call it, ego death, blah blah blah, i was there, and then oh shit, you guys can't hear me, can you guys hear me, someone say there's no sound, okay, i guess there is sound, i don't know people are trying to uh trying to gas light por kush and trying to talk to you guys please uh so anyway i had a moment of complete identification of oneness with the universe and then of course the second it was over i came back into my body i became reincarnated reembodied as as me uh and of course i started falling away from that moment you know as the roll the rock started rolling back down the hill and i was sisapfus and i got to walk down it and the thing about cicefus is uh kamu says you must imagine cisif is happy that's one of those things that just sounds like a zencone or something i understand it now because happy cisifis is when it gets to the top of the hill as often as possible because being on the top of the hill is fun and walking down the hill it's not as fun as being on the top of the hill but it's a lot more fun than pushing the goddamn rock up the hill so you just got to increase the the circuits, you can't keep pushing the hill, the b bolder up one long gradient, which is what most people do, and which we're cursed to do because of our material realities that constrain us and and and and and chain us. uh, so as I was coming back to my body and I was going down the hill and falling away, uh, the first word that came into my mind after, buse obviously in that time and there's no words, because language is obliterated, it's not needed, because you are one, you don't need to translate, as soon as i come back to my body, the first word, it was, it was a image in the sky of a crashing wave and the word yes, uh, and I realized that a lot of the like stuff I've been trying to get my head around in terms of like spirituality and and theology and questions of like body and mind and all these things that have been kind of i've been working on my head and i feel like i'm making progress but i've been struggling with cut through the word yes cut through a lot of it and it created a symbolic order that allowed me to make sense of everything i've been trying to get my head around and so sense of since my specific orientation as age race gender uh uh class background uh language, culture, all that stuff, when I heard yes, the first thing I thought was the end of uh Ulysses and I got and all of a sudden I had one moment of thinking, oh that's what it's like to have read Ulysses and then I was like, oh wait a minute, and then I thought, oh great, now I don't have to read Ulyssees, but then I realized I have to read Ulissees now, uh, even if it's bad, even if it's a slog, even if it's what? because it will remind me of that moment and doing it every day will remind me of that moment and get me living in a way that gets me there or gets me closer to it and it will inform my actions and it will inform my behavior towards the people around me and it will make them turn towards that sound so I'm going to start reading Ulysses and I'm thinking I might do it maybe chapter by chapter on here like I said it doesn't matter if it's good or not it doesn't matter. It's worth it, what matters is reading it, see look, this is what I'm thinking, and this is the reason that I'm thinking these terms is, I did a tweet that got a lot of people mad about better call Saul. because i said better calls all in my opinion suffers for trying to be a prestige show given the ingredients it has you've got uh you've got Saulman here played by Bob Odenkirk a great character we all love uh and we've got uh these great people behind the cast the great cinematography and they but and they and it ended up being the show it is with its you know basically copying the rhythms of breaking bad and becoming a breaking bad of explicit prequel filling in all these gaps of where'd huctor get his uh bell and things like that, that's inevitable as soon as it had to fit the format of a prestige show, and the thing is is that as a prestige show, it probably is great, i've watched enough of it, yes, it fits all of the terms that we discuss when we talk about prestige television, yes it is as good, you want to i will say it's as good as mad man, it's as good as break, it's as good as breaking bad or even better, it's as good as sopranos, whatever you want to say, fine, it's good, but it's good in the context of a television show, and the fact is, and i i've written about prestige tv and i've talked a lot about it and i was trying to articulate something that i've never actually been able to explicitly say in a way that felt to me like it even got what like i felt like i was even saying what i meant let alone if other people understood it and what i realized after with this you know mental ginsu now to chop everything up that i encounter uh is my problem with better call is that it is uh a product of the demirge, better call like all prestige tv is a product of the demarige, art is an attempt to reach the etheric plane, art is always an attempt to strike at the heart of the universe is to strike God and become god. every piece of every attempted art is that in some small way the way that the person making it can do or try to do, it's the urge to do it, but then there's the reality, the embodied reality of being a person, being a body that has needs and there's o material needs that shape the world and limit us, that's what the gnostics talked about, that's what uh, that's what the demourge the... evil god who creates this material world, it's illusion below the the uh the spiritual realm, like in this case, if we're talking about art, specifically in the context of art, you know, in an objective sense, television is a more degraded form of art than literature by the very simple fact that it is more commercial, and you might say, well, you know, Stephen King makes a lot of money and blah blah, no, what I mean by that is a book, the writing of a book and the publication of a book are relatively capital unintensive, making a television show is cap much more by by like cat by by exponential numbers, more capitally intensive than a book, which means that whatever art is in it has been constrained. by being a product of a commercial enterprise, and so that means that television will be, it can be good, every show could be fun, every show, you should enjoy every program you watch, either stop watching if you can't find yourself enjoying it, or find something about it that speaks to you, everything should be enjoyable, artistically, and if it isn't, then you just don't, you shouldn't find something that will, something that you can work with, because some things aren't going to work because the the talent of the... people involved, the amount of resources put to it, the amount of commercialism leven within it that it's going to hit you and it's going to make it hard. that is why i i see I see better calls all, and i go, because it just reminds me that we're all praying to this like degraded version of art, and the reason we are is because we have been immiserated like culturally, the capitalism has done that to us uh, that's not a that's not something you can argue, like our tastes are... more broad and people poptimus like to say, oh you're being a snob, but I'm recognizing a goddamn uh reality here, which is that there is a structural difference between art depending on how much uh they are required to make money, the degrier to which a piece of art needs to make money to be worth the endeavor levens its artistic, it's individual artistic expression, because it has to be translatable to the largest possible group, and the art in trans gets lost and so that's fine, you can find the sparks, you can find the things you like in anything, including breaking bat, but what happened is because we have been we've lost free time. we've lost energy, we've we've we've we've lost the ability to take a small moment and treasure something and really dig into it that we need our entertainments to be go down easier, they have to be uh absorbable because we don't have the energy, the mental or spiritual energy to sit with anything because of where we are because of how degraded our conditions are, because of our bodies essentially. all these institutions, capitalism, feudalism before it, slave labor, uh, every every class order created was created to uh, to manage the issue of getting bodies, keeping bodies alive, basically, um, and that creates our structures, it creates our economic structures, it creates our art, it's creates our culture, it creates our... personalities, it creates our religions, it creates our ideologies, it require, it creates everything, it creates this computer, it creates this phone, it creates this shirt uh, and and it creates the systems that create the exploitation, hyper exploitation that go into making the shirts and the the the the the gunpoint uh uh slave uh coal tan mining that makes this uh this uh phone and those things are all necessary to the degree to which they um allow for the... and so these institutions get warked. out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made. what that means is the crookedness is the fact that we have bodies and that's not a sin, it's not bad. you need to get the the christian thing is another another mistranslation from the initial uh uh from the initial true divining of like reality, the material world gets in the way and it gets baffled and so christianity gets muddled up with all this stuff and so when you say the b the like uh the body creates this world that's like, well that's bad, no, it's not bad, it's inefinable, it's it's inherent, we we have to deal with it, we have to create a society that minimizes, suffering by spreading pleasure out as broadly as possible, not concentrating on any individual, because that doing so creates a situation where you cause misery to all the people whose exploitation goes into the pleasure of that one person, and then that person's pleasure, guess what, it's It's going away, they're going to face the flames of uh of judgment, which is the coming of death, with the terror of hell in their heart, um, there's no stopping it, and so no one has gotten any kind of benefit out of that arrangement, we we have to have some suffering and pleasure just to keep the bodies going, but it should be spread out, that's where the dialect comes in, and that is why uh, like somebody said, go back to marxism, I'm sorry. this moment made me realize that like these are nesting series of thoughts and ideologies and like structures and guess what, nesting in here is dialectical materialism because that is how these this truth is um like certain sys like maybe nasticism or buddhism or something or the dark tower or fucking i was talking about uh infant just the other day maybe Ulysses those things help uh structure uh like your thoughts and make it make it easier for you to behave in a way that that reduces suffering uh, but then you need structures within other people amongst people in the social realm of economic production and political economy that need to serve those ends as well, and dialectal materialism is the drive towards that, it is the drive towards a world where everyone is free of the bodily uh uh needs, bodily um temptations and distractions is the word to reach full enlightenment, and like when people talk about fully fully automated luxury space communism, there's a lot wrong with that notion, but the true thing it's reticing with is that the only way for universal human enlightenment, which if enlightenment the individual goal as it well should be, then presumably it is the universal goal for all humans, then you need some sort of taming and and instrumentalizing of technology the goal of human uh uh uh enlightenment as opposed to the the dark uh singularity we're moving toward where the machine takes over and totally annihilates human uh spirituality completely and turns us into machines um and so we don't want that and so how do we stop one or the other how do we get to this and how do we push how do we push that uh Yeah, but you it requires a lack until you get to the top and you don't get there and stay there, it's a process, you go back, you go back and you come back, and you go back and you come back, it's pushing the fucking bolder up the hill, that's why it's compatible, goddamn, got to get never mind, but um, so if we want that version where all we universal then it requires uh in my view and I might be, and the thing is, I am wrong, at some point in time in the future, I am wrong, I think I'm right now, and I think I am right now, I have enough history around me, and I think I'm smart enough and compassion enough together to figure out like broadly what's right, more specifically as it gets drilled down, I don't have the information, or the intelligence to specifically answer questions of technological uh. like technological questions, social questions, whatever, but broadly, I think I'm right, uh, but I'm not right forever, at some point my my, what I'm uh, at some point in the future, at some point in spacetime, what everything I think is going to be wrong, every single thing, and that's true of you too, every human being, every single thing you have ever thought, every decision you have ever made has been wrong, and we are all in fact the the the um, the sum total of our wrong choices. so this is all the way of saying that you can enjoy better call sall to enjoy better call sall of course it make doesn't make sense to watch it if you're not going to enjoy it watching it to get mad at it you're getting pleasure somewhere else and at the end of the day the pleasure is at the expense because what are you going to do you're going to go online like i have a million times and like kick people in the dick and say ah fuck you this show is stupid and you're dumb for liking it that's the pleasure i get out of it and that's at someone else's expense, is all pleasure is. um, see, what makes a decision right or wrong, buddy? exactly, it's not defined until uh, afterwards, it's only retrospectively known, because all time has already happened, everything is already happened, everything has already happened, and when i say everything, i mean not just in your life, i mean the lives of all beings to exist or ever with. exist, but so you can enjoy better calls all, but you see the way people are defensive about the show and to see the way they get mad about it, and the way they write and even if they're not mad, the way they insist on its greatness, it's because they have decided that instead of acknowledging the lack at the heart of prestige tv as a concept instead of saying, oh this is sad that that now we have to get our real like our... artistic nourishment from something this just banalized, it's banalized, it has to be because it's commercial, it has to be binalized, and i'm and and this is i have to squeeze, i have to try so hard to squeeze meaning out of it, not for the not for my enjoyment of the show, but to convince other people and myself that watching this is actually good. and that's where that's why that's the sad, that's why your love of if you're say yeah, bring back, it's like it's not necessarily bad, it's not, it's not going to doom you to like it in that way, but it it implies a attachment to something that is degraded without acknowledging and recognizing the degradation and without the ability to the degradation, you cannot act in a way in your life to move away from degradation, both in your interpersonal relationships in your preferences, what you do with your time and what you think politics should be and how you should activate act on political beliefs, if if prestige tv is good enough, then what why do you need to change anything? see, here we go, somebody says, so commercial art is bad, no, no art is bad. the goodness of an every individual's relationship to a piece of art is completely individualized and it's and it's a result of translations because all art is translation, all existence is translation. your brain literally translating to you through language what is happening to it, first in symbols, first in senses, then in symbols, then in words, words to yourself, and then words to others. at every level the translation breaks down, there is loss between every level of translation, and um, by the time you're trying to express an idea through art, you're way down here, you're so degraded, but there's still, if you're talented. enough and enough people see it, and if you're collaborating with others and you make something together, because collaboration is is that's what like that's depending on the art form helps uh in the project it helps signal boost like and and bring together individual insights and individual talents um and it create something, so there's something to it, there's a spark to all art, just either the talent was not there to to express it fully or um or it was a piece of cynical dog shit uh but even that cynical dog shit will have things in it that might be enjoyable you can watch a piece of cynical dog shit with the right frame of mind and enjoy it the danger is when you mistake the shadows for the figures and that is what prestige television does. "if we just accepted, yeah, tv, it's it's the idiot box, uh, the shows could be the same, have the same stuff, and and it would be fine, but a a culture that requires television to be good, is one that has not acknowledged its barriers, exactly, the map is not the territory. Yeah, see like this is all the stuff, like play-doh stuff I never really got, now I get it, narcissism, I never really got, I feel like I get it, and of course I get it less now than I did yesterday, and I will get it less tomorrow than I do today, my task is to get back, is to remember that moment, remember what I knew then and try to find it again, and the way to do that is by daily acts, by the eightfold path by the path of the beam, what that really means, not just i'm going to say epic pack of the bean when i see like a fucking uh uh stepen king reference it means doing my relationships with other people and my every action informed by the knowledge of what is there the imminence beyond behind reality the real the real universe beyond the demoergical one and then trying to get there and so that means i've got to uh that means these reading projects is not about learning something it's about relearning something, because you don't know anything, you only have echoing uh clanging notions in your head, a lot of them contradict each other, and the only way to thread them together in a way to make them useful is to sit with them, and that is not something that anything we do uh, encourages, not something anything in our culture encourages is sitting with these questions, yes exist materialism, whatever you want to call it, narcissism, whatever you guys want to say, uh, well we're going to put these, if you've missed anything, you can go back, these these now uh update to my uh, they don't go to the stories anymore, i guess ask instagram why, but now they go to the time to the grid, i guess they're called, so if you missed anything you can check. that uh and all this while the cheeto and the white house what the hell because like nasticism says we this is a degraded uh shadow realm, it is, it's a degraded shadow realm of material reality, but we have to work with it, how do we work with it? how do we put, how do we thread it, how do we push it in a direction that leads towards the chance for more as many people as possible to achieve transcendence and direct it back to themselves and future and to everyone else who can hear them in their lives and people around them, um, it's by by the dialect, it's by or it's by uh by resolving contradiction, because contradiction is at the heart of existence, no and yes, the universe, the universe is yes, and it's always there, and it is outside of space and time, the world is no, and it is, and we are all every... person, every being in the universe, every, every photon, every chain of chemicals, every, every anything, those things are all nose, those are... different levels of rejecting, and the thing is, there aren't that many of them, but there doesn't need to be, because yes, exists outside of space and time, it is the accumulation of nose over this endless spance, they are accumulated in actual real, in this world, and you got to get back to yes, and the thing is, I say that, and you hear it, it's like, what does that mean? and for me, these words, getting back to yes, they're frated with my memory. of this experience, you are only hearing my words, retell it, which is frauguence, as Niche points out, all language is a why, uh, all I can do is use my talents, that's to such an exist they to such extent that they exist, and uh, and my will, my morality to uh, my intellect, to to um, to try to push in the... direction of the good, so that's better call saul. like i said, i'm sure half of this is totally incoherent. it makes sense to me, but that's because i experienced it, and my hope is is that by like trying to take this seriously as a practice of mind, i will stay close enough to this that i can occasionally get back there. and when I come back, hopefully I'll have an even better vocabulary, because I've had these moments before, they're all drug related because I'm a cheater, because I'm a lazy shit, because I have bad morality, I have, I mean, I don't bad morality, see once again, the judgmental, I my my bad and good traits, all of my bad and good traits intellectually, and morally, whatever, were fixed in time by the mistakes of others, it is still my duty then to live with them and and proceed with them and try to uh use what i have that's good, minimize what i have what's bad, that is my task, that is why uh both we are both totally determined, all activities, all all actions are fully determined physically, absolutely, and yet you still have free will, yeah, no, i'm hoping to meditate more as well, um, the sublime, exactly, that's what we're talking about, uh, and like people come at that from different ways, like and different things contribute to your ability to get there, and like my specific combination of abilities and and uh uh uh, my my character traits both positive and negative that have been fixed by by others, got me a spot to see a couple of these moments and every time i came back with a little more of it that made sense, and then it would go away, and the fact that I was only able to articulate it somewhat is part of what made it go away, because I couldn't convince myself to keep trying, because I couldn't even, I couldn't even keep translating it to myself because I kept forgetting it, because I was not in that present moment of mind, and now that I have an even more like coherent vocabulary for it that actually makes sense, uh, I'm hoping that I can express that. every day, i can already feel it like right now it feels different uh, but like i said, it goes away with time, and that's the thing to remember, nobody really believes, all beliefs are acted upon, and if you don't act on your beliefs, you don't really believe them, and like the thing is that doesn't just mean big lofty, like ideological blows, like literally down to you, uh, true false, like objective uh, statements of fact, if you don't believe something, you don't act on it, and I need to believe this in order to act on it, which means I have to keep in that mind space, because in that mind space I know with full certainty that I am correct, and the thing is it doesn't matter if I'm not, because there is no, there's no one to check, it's my body, it's my consciousness, it's going to end at some point, I want it to end, I want to be able to greet death with a smile by having at least come close enough to the ineffable that maybe I can grab for the ring, you know what I mean? or or get there whatever I want, I mean obviously that's the buddhist uh like end state uh which is very difficult to achieve why because you have to actually have fucking uh material conditions met like you have relationships with people you are meshed in a social network that has to be nourished so that means that it doesn't matter if there is no right or wrong there is no uh there's no one's going to check the score after I die no one is going to look at my test results it's all about what happens in the interrum between those two cosmic mistakes, my life, my birth, which is the result of the accumulated mistakes of everyone leading up to that moment, and my death. which will be caused by the accumulated mistakes of everyone else and myself, but of course those mistakes were caused by other people's mistakes, because as I said, all acts are fully uh determined, see this person saying, oh you can do things without thinking about your actions exactly, exactly, you're not thinking about your actions, so you are carrying out a belief, that's the actual belief, the thing you think you don't really... think, you think you think it, but you don't really think it, if you really did, you'd act that way, it's not, it's like, i really believe it, no, you don't, and it's like, if it gets up into like, if you guys are talking about political stuff like marxism or like socialism or something, those are so huge and amorphist that like it's it was, it's impossible to tie them to enough direct actions to say one way or the other, but they trickle down into specific premises. and if you do not really believe the premise, you will not act on it, it's unconscious, but it's real. And the thing is is that people are so fucking afraid of being wrong, and I think I realize is that you must always know how that you are wrong, you are wrong, something deeply, something that you believe in the soul is wrong, it might not be wrong now, you might live your entire life and that thing you believe is true. but at some point it won't be true anymore every fact statement ever was true at some point, there's a famous uh birt and Russell uh uh philosophical like uh uh uh proposition where he he's talking about like he's talking about uh language as like order how like a sentence that's that's correct without being correct and his present and his example was the sentence, the present king of France is bald, right? that was his that was his hippocket uh example, and of course that is the the words in that sentence make sense, they're in the right order and it gives you meaning, but there is no president king of France, so his hair or its non-existence is, but the thing is there was a pr uh bald king of France, the one of the carolinians was fucking charles the bald, and every and and if you think outside of... your life, if you think outside of uh this world and think of the nested, nested nested, testeracting, expanding multiple versions of you, multiple versions of earth, um, that exist, then it's happened somewhere, all all, all of them have happened somewhere, so every statement, every belief is true at some point, and it's your job and life to to in good faith seek uh uh truth, knowing that you will fail, knowing that you will fail, knowing that the vast majority of us will, 99.99% of us die in fear and horror, uh, and um, and knowing that all you can do is try and see like somebody said unfalsifiable, how could you falsify anything? you can't falsify uh, i don't know man, i i googled this, pretty sure he said that, yeah, bertin Russell, the president king of french, why do people gaslight me, or are you like trying to make? "i don't know, i shouldn't care, see this is the thing i need to remember, it doesn't matter if it's correct or not, it doesn't matter if i'm right or not, i just need to try to communicate to people, and if i'm good enough at doing it, and i try long enough and hard enough, is the real important thing, then hopefully somebody will get something out of it, and it will help them, and it will help me, uh, exactly, many don't try because they don't know how to, and that's why this has to be divorced from judgment, you" you you have to divorce this from judgment, like a person who is unable to to to to like a child soldier in Liberia, there they are fixed by others mistakes and others uh uh weaknesses uh uh fucking Donald Trump Jr. is fixed by and Donald Trump himself, Hitler, all fixed, they still had a responsibility to to to seek truth and they failed. but they failed because of specific uh uh limitations imposed on them from outside, and so all we could do is try to live in accordance with beliefs as close to enlightened as possible so that we can speak them and live them to others so that they can live them to others, it's like a fucking mulky level marketing scheme, it's it's a ponzi scheme that ends with the world being universally enlightened and the universe winking out of existence, because the demi urge, spoiler alert, the evil god who created this material fake world, guess what, it's me, spoiler alert, it's also you. Every one of us is God and every one of us is the demirge. And the demiurge in material form is the accumulated bad decisions of every human being, and then within us, the dimirge is that which accepts that reality of face value. So, and see like, I was thinking about this the other night, like while I was. thinking about, i thought about Jordan Peterson and Jordan Peterson's shit about um about like uh dragons of chaos, it's like he is getting at real things, real dialectical dialectical uh engagements, real binaries, but his premises elsewhere are wrong, so he reaches bad conclusions from an essentially based correct, and then you get people who and the thing is like the most of the people who get mad at Peterson have... not gotten as deep as him, they are treeding in shallow water, they are more trapped by the material uh, restraints than him, but um, they're they're right, they're more right than him, in other ways, they have a they they understand like the the implications and reality of like social structures and politics and economics better than him, maybe, so they are, he is wrong and they are right, even though he is right and they are wrong, just... different times and at different places and it's about twisting all of these into an arrangement where all of the fucking gunk and and uh and uh blocks are gone and the light can shine through, it's like imagine like your consciousness, the universe, it's like the dark tower, it's like a spindle, it's like a a fucking finger trap or like one of those uh, what the hell is that uh codex? and there's all these different arrays, these binaries, these interlacing binaries, and you have to get all the yeses on one side and all the no is on the other, but figuring that out is the work of life, and it's a collaborative work, and you might be right down here in one part of the puzzle and you're wrong up here, and guess what, you're fucked, you're just as fucked as somebody who's wrong up here and right down there, which is what you see with these awful just dispiriting battles between ID Paul people and and the all right nazis or whatever. and like trad cats versus uh you know uh sex workers, it's like they have all gotten something correct, but there are but they are accepting certain theses that are wrong, they're set accepting certain fundamental theses, they're accepting features of this superstructure of culture uh and expectation uh and value that are generated by capitalism at face value, it's just different. No, the reason you behave morally is because if you behave morally, it other people respond to it, that's why, and if you maintain morality, even if they don't, you acknowledge and recognize why they aren't, it's collaborative, yes, it's being mostly right, but not just on a like there's that less wrong subreddit where they all want to fucking like put USB cord in their dick or whatever, they're thinking in terms entirely of intellect, like we're going to split time and I'm going to live forever in a robot body, no you're not, you're not going to lift from a fucking robot body, and even if you did, guess what, there is not finite, there's a finite amount of energy in the universe, so after what, you get to be a floating robot body for what, five million years, how how is your brain, how is your what, what is your life like, what is your what is how is your heaven, it's hell, it's eternal hell until death. Congratulations, but it's less wrong on the axis of intellect and rationality and insight, but also in feeling and empathy and social coordination and social life, because the end is coming either way, the end of your life, the end of the universe, the end of l, life on earth, the end of everything, it will come to an end and then it will start again, it will start over again. and you'll get it wrong again, everyone will get it wrong again, but slightly differently, and then eventually somewhere, it's already happened, get it right, which is why we even have consciousness, why this world even exists, because at some point we close the loop, i'm actually not on any drugs right now, i'm not, i haven't even smoked weed today, bad the alcohol uh, i got to say, i don't know, i mean i'm probably still going to smoke me once in a while as you know as as my weakness uh overwhelms me and as i fail as i will, but right now i don't need it, i'll need it in the future, but the thing is, and this is what thing the defeats so many people attempts to seek enlightenment is that if they fail once the like, i guess i didn't get it, i guess i didn't do it, but it's not, you're never fixed, you're you're you're you're you're you are, you don't, you aren't anything, you aren't a marxist, you aren't a american, you aren't a christian, you aren't any of that, you are, you are in a quantum state at all times until you act, until your brain thinks a thought and then you act on it, you're not anything, uh, and that is the mark of mistakes on the world, how do you close the loop, as I described, universal consciousness, and on a long enough timeline and with enough universes that will happen as all things will. yes, I do therefore I am, because I remember reading at Derek Jenson and he's like an Ann Prim, whatever, but he made a good point about uh that at the time I thought was stupid, he was talking about like the the awfulness of cartesian dualism and saying like to see Descar say I think therefore I am. and he wrote, "I want to go to Descart and say, "Rene, do you not also feel?" And I was like a 19-year-old like, I was read it didn't exist, but I would have been on it, uh, going like, that's stupid, but now I understand what that means, you need both, they are literally the same thing, they are, they are both, they are both conditions of uh, consciousness that uh, operate independently and also between each other. thought and action is flawed. I'll read about your delay. Shut up. It doesn't matter if it's right or not. It doesn't matter because like of course I don't know the specifics. I haven't done the reading. I i don't know how to do math, complex math. I can't even count on my fucking fingers. Doesn't matter. What matters is whether it makes me act right. And the reading gets you to act right. You don't learn anything, you don't become something by reading it. The act. reading it and thinking in flex your behavior. right, because no is the other, no is recognizing the other. yeah, i don't see how that contradicts what i said, but uh, Yes, your your your autonomomic system acts before you, but that's uh, that's physiological, and that's just the same translation system, and there's a delay because of that, but you still then something comes into your mind, and it's determined by what you've interacted with, like why I'm saying is this is all determined, it's all determined, but you still have to act. but the thing is you you, you always recognize the other, even if you say you don't, you are, whether it's to to try to uh embrace or to destroy, it's a recognition of the other no matter what, like the other is not just like a minority or another language, the other is your fucking mom, you know, the other is literally every other uh conscious being that you encounter, who's who reminds you of your subjectivity, or your objectivity rather. because being an object and a subject is essentially a contradiction and it freaks out your brain and we've been trying to like get back to to harmony it and it's very difficult because of the the uh conditions that our bodies require to uh to maintain them. all right, well it looks like everyone's mad at me, i'm sorry, uh, i was just trying to work some stuff out. uh, I'm not going to try to argue with anybody, especially over the thing, but especially, like I said, I'm probably describing a lot of this incorrectly, because I'm not a genius, I just know what I felt and... know what is the closest human words to what it felt like and like i said it can't be wrong cuuse i know it was right and it's like if i act on it and it results in people getting mad at me and every like uh like uh as Rayland Given said you run into an asshole in the morning you ran into an asshole you run into an asshole all day you're the asshole and that's the thing it's subjective, but it also confronts reality because you have to practice it, and then what does it get you? that's the question. what does it gets you? and it's like, oh yeah, you can be a piece of shit and acquire all this money and wealth and stuff, yeah, okay, but uh, you're still at base, miserable, your pleasures are fleeting, and very few people can even and your hording of pleasure means that others can't even are are other people. are denied uh basic pleasures, like the ones that all humans require, not not the broke disgusting ones that are uh machinery of exploitation offer up to us and lue of uh freedom, the cat is being locked in here with me because he's causing too much chananigans in the other room, there's nothing i can do, there's I'm sorry. All right, I'm going to try to get the cat over here, so I could stop being so sad, buddy, what's your problem, do you want to cat? I think you really want to go in the other room, no. Yeah, see, I wanted to be, I wanted to pet the cat, but the thing is, I have, I have, I have taught the cat to treat me poorly by uh, scorning him, by by not being there in a moment and like acknowledging his needs, and now he doesn't trust me and nor should heat, that's karma, that's literally what karma is, good or bad. so now he won't come over here, maybe over time, if I behave differently now, he will come over to me, but I have to earn it, and he has to respond to my attempts to earn it, uh, and some people are compatible that way, and some people aren't, and there's no judging it, you just have to acknowledge and understand, that's what it is, it's all understanding, that is the task of all humans and I don't mean what you can understand like not like these these enlightenment says oh understand your reason it's like that is insufficient we've seen what just uh uh just tempering your blade of reason gets you it gets you a planet that is dying it gets you a a population that is miserable and a miserated and sick and and and unfree everywhere no cl uh absolutely howling in the fucking cages, like a like a like experimental resiss monkeys, that's what that's what pure, but it's like you can't not have it because that's how you build capacity to allow material saciation of needs by industry, by by technology, by the application of human reason to the material world, but by itself, it gives you annihilation, it gives you the holocaust, exactly, it gives you uh, it gives you nuclear war, it gives you climate change, uh, it needs, it needs to be tempered, and uh, it's tempered by cooperation, like like when I say morality and I say a moral sense, when I say my my virtues, those are all produced by my relationship with other people, they are entire, they are not within me, none of them are, they are entirely outside, intellect is... interior, you get information from outside, you and then your intellect is basically the sum total of your experience of other people's information, but but your morality is entirely the product of your interaction with other people, and it's entirely synthesis of of other people's treatment of you, and your response to that, and I'm going to try to be nice to the cat. The other night, she was yowing and instead of getting mad at her, I just said, well, what do you need? usually... she has the food and water, should i scoop the b box and it's like oh yeah i scoop the box she went in there and now she's not meing right now she wants to go in the other room sadly so and that's what Rolson Sall talks about with voltair's bastards is pure rationality uh instrumentalizes humans to the degree that human civilization is no longer viable because we're not people anymore, we're instruments, and that's what we're headed towards, doesn't have to be, and we're all working on what way, and some of us are right, and some of us are wrong, none of us, no, I'm sorry, some of us are less wrong than others and and if enough of the less wrong are able to cooperate, they can make in the world the proof of their correctness in the world until it becomes, it overtakes the structures that are created by dead mechanistic rationality. all right, so that felt nice, i don't, i hope i don't sound completely insane. because I don't want to be buse you know like this kind of cuuse I said like I said I said I know it's right to me and it doesn't matter if it's not right to you well it does matter if it's not right to you if what I experienced makes me go out and like you know take my dick out on the subway and stab people randomly or you know uh hit my neighbor or something then then that's that's dissociative then there's a break in me there is a physical uh emotional break caused by biology and by the behavior of others and my response to it. uh that um, of course we're living in a simulation, but it doesn't, of course we're living in a simulation, the simulation is is reality, the simulation is our collective material attempt to reconstruct a world as individuals out of the undifferentiated universal consciousness we emerge from, so like it doesn't need like that's that's that's that's another point of like the mechanistic def, it's like the demairge talked about spirit, well we killed god so it's not about there's no demairge cuuse you can't convince anyone of that because we killed god uh so now oh it's a machine but it's the same thing it's the same purpose it's it's recognizing the same fallen state of consciousness that was required to just live related to what we could be, but now we give it a mechanical name rather than a spiritual one because we've killed the spirit. and replaced it with pure reason, which is what, which is what decadence comes from, that's where decadence comes from, that's where all this, like the trad cats, the trad people are right in the sense that the things we're using to fill the gap are alienating and poisoning, as are all pursuits of pleasure, but they're not, they're not inherently evil, they are, they are mechanisms of coping, and the degree to which we can we can disconnect the machine, problem is is that we have this machinery that turns all of our worst the all the worst elements of society. marks talked about this uh about like on the Jewish question like uh capitalism creates all these dehumanizing conditions uh between people uh and then creates a structure that says actually those those uh uh uh those like broken relationships are good actually it's it's that's supposed to That's supposed to be the way it is, and in fact here, here are xy and z things you can buy or do or or jobs to take or whatever the fuck, places you can be slotted in the honeycomb hierarchy of of of industry uh to to indulge them, oh poor little guy. I don't know specifically, I don't know the I don't know enough about uh like neuroscience to say where are thoughts come from, but I do think the thing that generates thoughts and the thing that generated the universe is a fundamental contradiction, and the contradiction is to be a feeling being that perceives itself as feeling. That's where our thoughts come from, and that's what separates humanity from all other beings of course, all all other beings have, they're all on the same, they're all on levels of the tower, they're all in different areas, they're all in different spokes of the wheel, we consider ours higher, but that is judg, that's just a judgment, that is that is a demiorgical uh uh spook, uh, but it's... It's just different and that means we have that curse and that that gives us the ability to shape this material world in a way that animals that don't have that ability. can't and so we have to try to do it, that is our mission, and we fail that task to the degree to which we put our our work, our bodies, our minds towards the towards satisfying uh physical indulgence, and that doesn't just mean like uh, eating a quarter pound or anything, it means cumulate, it just it could mean it means simply accumulating surplus value from surplus calories, because to have surplus calories means someone is. more than someone else, that's the that's where you get the division of labor, that's where you get the the apple in the garden, someone has to work more than someone else, because if they don't, there's no, there's no surplus to allow for moment of repose, and uh, that is the task of society civilization, and the hungry ghost says, no, I will make a I will turn the world and i will become God and i will uh i will be the only thing in the universe and the thing is if you are the only thing in the universe then you are damned you are you are satan you're you're actually you're actually lucifer morning star uh owned but if we collectively seek to better. each other, spread material suffering as thinly as possible, increase uh everyone's capacity for uh play and and and presentness and thought and and kindness and and uh all of those things then then we can restructure, we can make this world differently, i mean obviously that's not there's it's not like yeah yeah and in your lifetime everyone's going to transcend to the eteric plain of course not absurd. I'm saying in some distant galaxy, some thousands of billions of whatever, that might be happening, here we're going to fail, we will fail, we will, we will fall short of that, it is without question, how far short is the only difference between one version of reality and one life and another is how far short we fall, and all we can do is push because there's nothing else to do, there's nowhere else to go, there is nowhere else to go, you can the wicked fleet or no, none pursueth. There's nowhere else to go but inside, the only way out is through.
