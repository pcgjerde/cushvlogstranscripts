 This is oh there we are, oh my god, I'm on, I love it when it works. Oh, I do not want to turn on notifications, good lord, that sounds terrible, why is it now saying I'm not on there anymore? I was on there, now I'm not on there, what the fuck, what, why, what, oh, there I am, there I am, hi folks, I'm indoors because the... great storm has come, the storm is coming, q was right, oh my god, the storm is here, it's storming out, this is a storm that they spoke of, and now we're having it, storm it up, old stormy Daniels, yeah, i'm honestly shocked, i kind of thought that New York's days of accumulating snow before March were over, about to walk through it as it started. really gave me a old old homesick vibes of Wisconsin freezing my ass off walking home from school. nice uh we will be talking later in the episode, stream, whatever the hell you want to call this, moment in time about the first three chapters of uh this year book, the republic for which it stands by Richard White. but I wanted to uh give people a chance to show up, you know, if they've read the book, I don't want to start off, because you get more people as time goes on in these things generally, so like in about half an hour or so uh we'll start talking about the book. Right now uh, I wanted to comment on something that I've noticed, which is every time barfsacombo comes out with one of his uh, absolutely banal popular culture takes where he's he talks about all... a parasite, that's a great movie, or when he just talked about how while he was writing his awful menoir, he uh found solalis and better call Saul and the boys, i mean obviously part of me is very smug about being like, aha, here literally is our prestige tv president, talking about how much he loves these shows, think about Trump relative uh comparatively, does Trump ever talk about an hour long streaming dramas? no, he talks about watching fox. or newsmax or whatever CNN, he talks about uh cable news, which is basically a reality tv channel, like if you take the concept of reality tv seriously as this uh the the the destruction of the barrier between you know uh living in America and and watching America, cable news, which is very little news in it obviously, it's mostly just talking heads, emoting about politics is essentially a... fucking reality show and all those people yelling like Hannity, that's just an incredibly long confessional sequence, you know, I can't believe Nancy Polosi uh ate the peanut butter with her finger and put it back in the on the shelf, that kind of thing, so again we see the Prestige TV president and the reality TV president, and our prestige TV president, he was loves watching the boys and he loves, he loved watching the wire when it was on, and one thing I see a lot is people saying how... Obama watching these shows considering all of the anti-corporate, anti-capitalist themes in them, how is he watching them? he must not be absorbing them, he's either lying about watching them or he um, he is not uh, he is not, he is somehow missing the subtext that I am able to absorb, and I am here to ask, uh, posit this, what about this, what about this possibility? what if Barf sacombo gets exactly everything out of these shows that you do and these movies? he sees parasite, he watches the boys, he's not uh coming out with some mutated version in his head, he's getting the same message as you are, it just doesn't fucking matter because this is just entertainment at the end of the day and he is position is fixed enough in the world and his uh value system is fixed enough around uh maintaining you know his his role as a power broker within it that nothing he's going to see is going to change his mind and I think see otherwise smart people kind of like instinctively reject the... notion that he could be absorbing this art at the level that they are, because there is buried in all of our assumptions about artistic consumption that are now completely intertwined with our politics, the way we talk about uh television and movies specifically is essentially is completely inextrickable from politics, you it's almost impossible to have a conversation about any any of these products that is not inherently politicized before you even start talking and of course It's always politicized, but I mean explicit politics as opposed to like broader, ideological underpinnings of work, and the the reason you do that, I mean obviously it's because in my cynical view, because there isn't a lot of art in this stuff, and you've got to fill fucking column inches with something, you've got to fill the void with something, you can't, you can't uh confront with sober sense the the hollowness of all of this, but also is an similar delusion that comes from the the rejection of that reality, which is watching the right shows, watching the right movies will somehow make you a better person in a fundamental way, not just in your outlook, but in your actions, it will change you for the better in your day-to-day uh experience of life, and while that is true of great works of art and the individual's response to a great work of art, or even an individual's. response to a specific piece of uh you know more uh attenuated art that has like a specific resonance to them, that's the case, but it cannot be scaled, and that is the fantasy at the heart of all of this political fixation with our with our media is that we assume that there's some extrapolatable and and uh and compounding social vector towards good or evil that emates out of a... popular film or television series, and I am here today to say that there is not, there's nothing, it doesn't do anything, our moral choices are are determined by uh, by interests that are far far deeper than any glib shit we're going to pull out of a fucking TV show that by definition is fucking spoonfeeding us, if it wasn't spoon feeding us, it wouldn't be on television, so I'm sorry, I think I mean I don't. mean, I think Obama is a smart guy, I don't think he would have got where he was if he wasn't, unless you believe he was a CIA clone from avat and maybe, but he clearly was able to apply strategic and tactical insights in the political process that allowed him to defeat to essentially jump the line ahead of a bunch of other people, and that required more than just oratorial skill, uh, but like he's not a great mind, obviously, he's very uh, he is. he is happy in his change, he's happy in the fetters that he has given himself, because they excuse him to do whatever he wants, they given the excuse to pursue power nakedly, because well somebody's going to pursue power nakedly, and I'm afraid we have to be niburian in in our in our understanding that that the evils of the world cannot ever be vanquished and that attempting to do so is a greater evil than even those existing evils, and so therefore we are left with the question of how to live, and therefore if I want to dedicate myself to... rising to the top of this this pyramid of monstrosity and oppression by uh by putting a a smiley uh diverse face and a neoliberal retrenchment that's going to immiserate everybody and that is going to just continue this driving rationing capillary action of human misery. someone's got to do it. it might as well be me, it might as well be the sensitive guy who reads the right books and watches the right shows and watches the right movies and comes to the right conclusions about them. ones the same ones that we in the fucking sheep seats come to, but they don't, he is able to rationalize them the way we all are every day with everything we know to be true but can't deal with, because accepting one truth means dis inconveniencing ourself in some significant way, and we have to get to a point where that where where that truth has an emotional weight that is anywhere anywhere close to the emotional weight of... are more embedded personalized preferences, what we think we want, the only way to get there is through, i hate to be a broken record, but through spirituality, through through through the ritualized enchantment of ideas and enchantment of values that can give them a a motivational force that can break away from the these gravitational pole of self-interest. Barack Obama was able to take his self-interest and turn it into a religion, that's why he was able to do what he did, but most of us aren't that, aren't that skilled or aren't that sociopathic, and we have to mudle through. being pulled between what we know to be true every moment and what is convenient for us in our personal understandings of our our self-interest and and it's fighting those things that's our daily battle and and art is an expression of that conflict, but it is not ever going to resolve it for us and it's hard to understand or it's hard to grasp that because it really does render a lot of the time and energy we put into consuming and talking. about media and uh makes it a kind of a a a empty and and pathetic waste of time and and since we have no idea of what to fill that void with, we'd rather avoid that that reality all together. like i said that the the prestige tv anti-heroes are sociopaths, honestly i don't think they are because then there wouldn't be a show, like the shows, those shows are about a deeply, deeply talented in one way or another, and also deeply, deeply, um, selfish person, battling with whatever fragmentary, uh, echoed, half-remembered conscious they might have, the thing that makes them unable to just be happy in their consumption, but their audience, the... imagined audience, that guy I was talking about, the one that they're all subconsciously writing for, that upper middle class striving, fixed, eyes fixed on self- advancement professional who is the ear consumer of this stuff, that's a sociopath, that's a person who has fully resolved these conflicts, that's why you wouldn't want to watch a show about them, that's why you wouldn't want to watch a show about obama, a prestige tv show where Obama is the protagonist would be absolutely sterile and boring, none of there'd be none of the... psychological torment, there wouldn't be any of the any of the strum and drung and the and the and the dark humor that you get with other show with shows about people trying to like gesture towards a sense of uh morality that transcended their personal interest. Barack Obama makes no spends no effort doing that, spend spends not a second wondering about that stuff, so how would the show be interesting? and that is what and that's be and and that's because television like all mass market art is about not only about but is partially about and this is one of the things that attenuates its artistic uh uh merit like it's it's generalized artisticuh value as an art form is that it's pandering it's pandering to that audience it's giving them what they think they want to see because if they didn't want to see it they wouldn't watch it and if they don't watch it you're not going to get another episode and you're not going to get another ' renewal and you're not going to get to make another movie, and that is a compromise that is deeper even than thought with with these guys, these show runners who created these programs, and so they're flattering them, they're taking that fucking blank eyeed uh uh professional psychopath and they're giving them, they're they're flattering them and extending to them the uh fiction that they have a conscience to struggle with, which they don't. Why wouldn't Obama like the boys? I don't understand why it's insane that Obama would like the boys. Like, he he, like I have said, he doesn't think that he is, he has power, he doesn't think that that the president is fundamentally a a job that is about doing things from one's own volition, it's about serving a mechanism that is inviolable, so what, what, why would he? why would he be horrified by the boys? why would that make him disconfitted? i don't hate the boys, the boys is fine, it's not anything to write home about, and if it's what prestige tv is now then the fucking genre is, i mean a complete joke, although honestly season 4 of fargo should have fucking put the nail in the coffe in there anyway, holy shit what a piece of shit, what a pretentious, i hate using the word pretentious, anybody do call who calls art pretentious is is just on themselves most of the time, but for season 4 of Fargo is Noah, noah Holly, the guy who created it, showing the fundamental problem with him as a television creator, which is that he thinks he's too good for TV, remember this is a guy who is directed a film, written directed a film, which by the way, I watched and sucks, uh, wrote a book that I'm not reading, television is in his own mind beneath him, and that shows throughout all of his work, but in season 4 Fargo, it's just it's... Overpowering. Yeah, prestige TV is is is the Obama of art, it's this thing that is all we have, like all we have, all all liberalism can stand on now, now now that it can no longer offer anything to anybody materially, now that now that the the the material pitch of the Democratic party that made it the natural ruling party of the United States for 40 years uh, is gone and all the... have left is the ability to push forward on the strength of celebrity, on the strength of personality, and you might say, but what about Biden? They wanted Obama again, they never wanted anything other than Obama, the democratic electorate, they would have voted him a third term overwhelmingly if it hadn't been for the constitution, if he'd been able to come back for like uh, like Putin in this time, they would have. for him, overwhelmingly, if Michell Obama had run, she would have gotten the nomination, Biden was the closest thing anyone had. Now Budegej thought, I'm going to be gay Obama, but he doesn't actually have the charisma that Obama had and his and the fact that he is so clearly trying to apepe Obama's voice manerisms means that his ability to to break out of that box is already it's completely uh abbregated just by virtue of his his transparent phoniness. so there was no Obama to pick, what there was was Obama's VP, so he would talk about Rap Rock and people be like, oh yeah, Rap Rock, what about I wonder what Rap Rock's doing, and you saw they have a poll now, what was, what's your pick for uh 2024, Michelle Obama, number one, and then Harris number two, which is like six degrees of separation, the vice president's vice president, and that's why the democrats are fucked because they built everything, in 2008 like Obama... them this this thought, this hope, oh, we we can, we can govern, during conditions of neoliberal austerity, neverending, over wrenching, continuously compounding neoliberal austerity, without a material pitch to the voters with this uh narrative, and they i mean and the proof of was in the putting in the form of obama winning big and then winning a big real. election, which democrats haven't done for a while, I mean even, even Clinton never won a majority of the vote, he was under under 50%, well under 50%, he was at like even in his re-election where he crushed Dole, I think he got like 46% of the vote, someone can correct me on that, but it was not 50, because both times he was running in three-way races with pero a decent chunk for the the best that a third party candidate has done since like TR was uh pereau in 96 and 92, maybe wallets in 68, i'm not sure I got to look at it, but anyway, one either way, they really don't have a record of big big fucking uh crushing victories, and he got it, and then he got reelected, even though uh, you know, it looked closer than than it should have been, and even though, but while this was happening, of course the litney has been set a million times, they lost a thousand uh state legislator seats, they lost like a fucking third of governorships. they lost the house and then the senate and then they tried to run austerity with Hillary got killed, got to run with Biden and little shine of nostalgia and Trump's unique uh uh um unique's uncoothness, unique uncoothness to the nations well off meant that he could win. um, like I remember before the election I said that the reason I think uh after the after the first debate I said I think Biden's going to win and the... reason he's going to win is because people are going to have a choice between four more years of ever cranking political rhetoric or kind of taking the the heat off of the kettle for a little bit and i said people are going to pick that because there's still there's still relative security in this country there's still even with precarity there is enough security among voting people that that will carry through and if you look at the electorate you look at the the votes you look how the vote broke down the most comfortable people. shifted to Biden from Trump, because they have a house, they've got maybe a boat, maybe a maybe a skidew, uh, maybe two cars in the garage, they can go, they have some 401k money, they don't want to be in the street shooting it out with antifa, where did Trump gain? he gained amongst people who have the least to lose. the people saw the ratcheting up political rhetoric and and the... and they moved towards conflict and said, sure, bring conflict, why not? but they have no, they're screwed, the democrats are fucked because it was always a fraud, the whole thing was a fraud, it all depended on the specific charisma of barsacombo, which is now thanks to the constitution no longer uh accessible, and there's nobody in the wings, there's nobody who comes close, there's a bunch of off-brand obamas like fucking Corey Booker who's like a chucky cheese animatronic on the fritz trying to do Obama, and then you got fake ass and then who else? there's nobody, there's nobody, it's it's a bunch of fossils who who've clogged up the top of the party because they do not want to hand the rains over to anybody who is not fully enthrolled by the machine the way they are, and they don't trust anybody else to run the thing, and they're all insane megaliacs who don't think they can die like every other old American who's all decided that they're immorral. and this is just like prestige TV. coming into the and uh oh but then lastly so this is a totally fraudulent and and and uh doomed project but democrats are going to double and triple down because they don't have anything else and so they convinced themselves this is the only way things can be and that actually if you criticize it uh you're a piece of shit prestige tv is essentially the same thing it filled the void of attention that people had once their attention spans have been destroyed by the internet and their ability to uh put any thought or concentration into a difficult work of art was scrubbed away by the daily abuse of like being a a a screen centric human uh and also working working working more and more and more and having less and less time to devote to anything other than the most brain smoothening of recreational activities and in that but you know hey if you went to college you know you're supposed to want something. more than that, you know, and and there is that yearning we actually have that cannot often be articulated, but still drives us in some way, and fucking prestige TV fel devoid, hey, you know that crap, that slop for pigs that they used to sell commercial, that they used to sell beer and fucking uh, diets, uh, it's actually uh the premier form of artistic expression of our time, oh good, and then they wrote it and that are sticking with it, and they'll tell you that you're what, like an elitist or some shit or uh, or... somehow racist or problematic for saying that uh, instead of confronting it because they have nothing else. there's nothing else, because nobody has the energy to the attention to to pursue anything more challenging, and even if they wanted to, who could talk to them about it, and that's nice, that's half of it right there, at least half, maybe more honestly at this point, well more than half is talking about it, talking about our artistic uh, consumption, and if you don't have other people who have had the same. experiences who can you bounce things off of who can you get responses to your hot takes from both in real life and online and so barpsack is our prestige tv tell uh president and prestige tv is our our the barfsack of art. is the is that strike in India actually still happening because I thought it was one of buse the thing about India is once every once in a while like 250 people will go on strike but it's like a two day demonstration that's in conjunction with like a communist state government and like it's not really a strike i mean how many people who get freaked out who get very excited about Indian strikes are aware of that? I wonder if there's just a lot of semantic confusion there, people get excited because they hear general strike and and whenever anything happens politically in India, the sheer number of people makes your hair stand on because it's hard to conceive of of that, you know coming from America, which you know is hilariously small population-wise comparatively, uh, but you know, it's not, I mean it's i'm i'm glad to see uh Modi get any kind of pushback, but uh, I know that there are continuing protest by farmers uh in India. Biden is the mad TV president. That's actually pretty good. We were we've joked on the show before by the way about how one of the good things about Biden being president is that they'll bring back Mad TV because no one's going to be uh the the the perpetual outbidding on wokeness. like - a sensitivity to to uh to prejudice in in in media that is defying the Trump era. is gonna let up because Trump's not president anymore and everybody gonna feel a little more relaxed and that we're gonna bring back mad tv Biden is is is I mean those stories like those corn pop stories and uh and uh dog face pony soldier I mean the whole thing he could be a mad tv character like the mad he would be he would have been the president of a mad tv sketch just coming out and talking about you know uh taking a 57 Chevy to the mult shop and and then like he crashes through a wall or something, come on man, isn't that a great uh catch phrase for a mad tv character? all right, uh, so let's talk a little bit now about. the republic for which it stands, which in its first three chapters sketches out the uh early stages of reconstruction in the south and what uh Richard uh calls the greater reconstruction that encompassed also the uh the development of America's western expanse and the first thing we get uh in the first chapter about uh president about uh about presidential reconstruction is a good hard look at our worst president uh Andrew Johnson, a man who is almost singularly uh catastrophic in American history, because there are very few people you can look at and say almost anyone who could conceivably have been where they were would have been better, and then you look at how how how much happened stance and and and and total uh, random chance went into him getting it, it's it is enough to make you feel like there are other worlds than these and that that we're in the dark one and that things like that, not just that, but things like that are the hallmarks of a world where you know even far farther back than that, some domino fell in the wrong place and uh and they've been fallen wrong ever since and man that feels like one real bad domino is Andrew Johnson being president and reading about the specific his specific mission which he made his uh presidency about which was to readmit the south uh as quickly as possible with the uh maintenance of of existing economic structures and political structures, um, and then seeing how much effect that had in terms of un undermining the very early stages of reconstruction, and the thing is is that you know once the once congress came back from their hilariously long uh um recess, congress back then was basically a part-time job and uh congress convened, like new Congress is convened far later like than they do now, it was kind of a nightmare honestly, and it's one of the reasons they changed it, but even after they got back, so you had a period of pure presidential reconstruction until like December of 1865, and then even after Congress comes back and then even after Congress is comes back even more radically Republican after 66 mid-terms. uh Johnson is able to uh do an insane amount of damage and at the most critical time because even once Grant gets in we haven't got there yet in the book or uh or haven't spent much time anyway with the Grant administration but once Grant gets in and and is able to carry out you know the more radical reconstruction in in collabor more in collaboration with Congress than fighting them uh they are trying to reconstruct now on a situation that has much less of the fluidity, much less of the contingency, much less of the um potential that existed in April of 1865, because fucking Andrew Johnson spent four years cheating all over it, and it's it really makes me more resolved than ever to really try to pursue this as project this idea of like if Lincoln lives, because it would not, i i i would not want to make Lincoln like this world historic savior figure uh more than anything. I want to make Johnson the world historically catastrophic figure that he is, because honestly like Lincoln is assassinated and Hannibal Hamlin was still his vp or or fucking azarad had gone through with his mission to kill Johnson and Benjamin Wade, the radical republican uh president protem of the senate becomes president, you could still have had a much better outcome of reconstruction, although. I think Lincoln is sort of uniquely suited in that moment to you know at at that most protein moment to be exercising power, but things could have gone better with almost anyone else there, uh, and yeah, like it's less about Lincoln living than about Johnson not getting to be there and to just god, oh god, breaking up the fucking the the land grants that Sherman had given to Friedman and the and the coastal Carolinas, I mean, that could have been the bedrock of a of a the model of a redistributive uh reconstruction that could have been seized upon by guys like stevens and sumner and Wade uh and Lincoln eventually not at first of course like but maybe over time pulled in that direction by the flow of events um we didn't get that obviously we got instead this and uh so obviously Andrew Johnson in history's greatest monster and incredibly trumpian, like just perfect, the the way that he would uh personalize everything, hyper paranoid, the the fact that he went on a fucking he went on a presidential stump speaking tour to try to whip up hatred of congress, his uh the party that had nominated him by the way to be the fucking president uh or to be the vice president and the only difference is that he got fucking uh fucking heckled like when he went out and did that, people, people own the shit out of him because he was flying in the face of northern opinion. this is the other part of it is that he was, his his mission had no constituency in the north, and and honestly even in the south the constituency was pretty busted up, because there were a lot of uh uh southern ex-confederates wouldn't even look the gift horse Johnson was giving them, they were looking at in the mouth, they wouldn't even accept his mechanisms because they involved too much too much besmerching of the honor. um, yeah, he did like a, they're being very unfair to me, but the specific phenomena uh of Johnson, Johnson's presidency, which he spent trying to create the constituency for a white supremacist third party that he would be able to head and then run for re-election with, is almost precisely what happened, the last time a uh non the challenge. to the democratic party in the in the in the second party system uh tried to um uh create a broad tent to defeat that party which was the wig nomination of John Tyler to be uh William Henry Harrison's runningmate in uh 1840 one of the most the catastrophe that set the stage for all the catastrophes to come on other because honestly that's another point where you can get wacky with the counterfactual so Henry Clay who was like the the the the intellectual founder of the wig party the guy and also the political um uh the biggest political influence on Lincoln Lincoln loved Henry Clay Lincoln thought Henry Clay was the ideal American uh politician and he was a wig before he was a republican and his were always the wig notion of a um yoman republic uh that is uh nurtured and allowed to develop with coordination from central government as opposed to the jacksonian democratic vision of just let everybody get corn licored up and steal indian land and then that's it there's nothing for the government to do. so Clay essentially founded the weak party and ran a number of times against Jackson lost uh and then uh in 1840 the Wiggs had a real good chance because the economy had collapsed during Vampiren's presidency because the fucking uh the the the the model the the banking model that had replaced the destroyed bank of the United States helped create a the panic of 37 which really did discredit the democrat. to uh to buy to develop my land and to to um heat myself with Indian scalps that was that was that was by far the most popular political persuasion at the time and it saw itself uh fucking come to discredit by the collapse of the economy and by van Buren's refusal to do anything about it because they're democrats and they don't do anything about the the economy that's not the government's job and the wigs really wanted to make sure they didn't fuck it up so they didn't nominate clay because he was a loser, they nominated a war guy, william Henry harrison, hey war man, yay, he fought in our colonial wars, you idiots like that right, he's one of you, uh, and they offered the vice presidency to Clay, and Clay turned it down, because he was pissed that they had not gotten him the nomination again, even though because it was his fucking party, and so then the wigs did a catastrophic... stupid thing, like I said, the stupid thing that set the stage for all the stupid things to come later, and that was they nominated John Tyler South Carolina is the vice president, because they were want they were trying to appeal as not as the party that was not the majority party of Americans, they wanted to appeal to never Jackson, basically or never van Buren, but really never Jackson because Jackson was the Trump, he was the personality, and was just riding the wake, even though he was the mastermind, Clay was both. obviously, but um, for the wigs, uh, but anyway, he was a never jackson democrat, he had split with Jackson, not over internal improvements or in favor of the tariff, but the opposite, over the uh nullification crisis, over the question of whether or not, the south, the South Carolina could refuse to uh carry out the the the uh, refused to comply with the tariff laws that. passed by congress and Jackson came down hard and said, I will hang John C Caloon who was his own vice president from a goddamn lamp post if these motherfuckers don't stop this, and Tyler and other southern democrats were horrified by that, the guys who ended up becoming the intellectual uh, you know uh found, the intellectual backbone of the secessionist movement, John C Caloon amongst them, but also Tyler, they said we're horrified by this display of the... absolutest power, and and we don't like Jackson because of his uh, his grasping for power, not not because of ideology necessarily, but just he is too power seeking, and the fucking wigs who called themselves the wigs, they pick that name because the wigs were the party in parliament in England, which was you know the the most close political culture to Americas, the ones that Americans were most familiar with, the wigs were the party of parliament against the paragan. of the king were the tories because they called him king Andrew and they fancied themselves as the defenders of the constitution against the the usurpations of jacksonian democracy and they wanted to get as big a tent for that message as possible and so they said hey john tyler you're horrified by jackson how about you too and they said sure they put him on the ticket and then fucking william Henryson drinks the dodo water and dies and instead of hen taking with big majorities in both houses of congress and being able to carry out in the wake of the the crisis of 37, carry out the American system, like actually try to enact a system of internal improvements that could have nit America together and mitigated against the rise of sectionalism, and perhaps slow down the the breakneck uh move towards expansion across the continent. instead you got John Tyler, a guy who had no sympathy for the wig ideology at any point and spent his entire term vetoing legislation from the party that nominated him and coasing up to southern slaveholders and democrats to create a third party run as the head of a explicitly pro- slavery party and it didn't it it fucked up it didn't work and then they gave the and then he didn't get the nomination of the Democrats, they nominated Pulk, uh, the Wiggs obviously told him to get fucked and nominated Clay, and then Clay, god damn it in 44, he came close, as close as he ever came, in fact if New York had flipped he would have won, and there's actually kind of a uh, there's an there is a uh Jill Stein of the 20 uh of the 1844 campaign, because there was a small abolitionist party called the liberty party. which was uh headed by an abolitionist named James Berney that pulled somewhere around uh I think 3% in New York, which was more than the difference between Pulk and Clay. uh in that state, and most abolitionists in the north voted for the wigs, so it's likely that they would have, if Bernie hadn't been there, they would have voted for pole or voted for Clay, and so you could blame the Bernie Broes, the Bernie Broes for the Mexican war, because it's less, much less likely the Clay would have pursued a war with Mexico than Pulk, and of course if you don't have the Mexican war, you do not have the civil war, so once again, the even if you're not if you want to talk about the the the uh dominoes fallen the wrong way, even before Lincon being succeeded by Johnson, you have fucking Harrison being succeeded by Tyler. So the rest of the chapters that we read are about uh the expansion of railroad infrastructure into the west, and uh, the way that white describe. and white is an expert on that specifically, the westward frontier is really his uh bailey awake, he's written a book that after this I might read because I'm enjoying this so far called railroaded, which is specifically about the way that uh railroad infrastructure was built after the civil war. um, if you know anything about the way that the government works now, the way that they built the railroad is incredibly, incredibly familiar a corrupt, handshake between uh consolidated capital, the capital that had emerged from the civil war and the government, giving out land grants to railroads and as and pitch to the audience to the American people as a self-funding mechanism that will allow for the creation of of American transportation infrastructure at no cost to taxpayers and instead of course what we got was a the beginning move towards full capture of all government uh prerogatives by that concentrated capital because the war was the original dynamo of American capital accumulation and then after the war what we replaced it with which was not of course obviously not nearly the uh the intensity of of the... but filling the same role was railroad infrastructure and then subsequent as part of but subsidiary to that uh building of like American military uh uh American military campaigns into uh to subdue Indian territory and uh I will say. that I'm enjoying the book so far, I think that for a, a a political, an ideological history, it is very perceptive, I very much appreciate White's emphasis on protestantism and and liberalism as drivers at at the level of politics, obviously, this is all on top of a material base that he doesn't really talk about, but that's part for the course in this kind of history is, it is uh it's going to be a political and cultural history and the Oxford series that this is part of, which I've read several other uh very good books from like battle cry of freedom uh is is is probably the best one volume book on the civil war and that's the Oxford from the Oxford series, what hath God rought, which covers the pre-civil war era uh like post-federal era, that's also very good, but they are fixed fixed mostly on culture and politics, which is always interesting in its own right, as long as you remember what this is all what the real drivers are, but uh, at the at the at the level of politics and culture, which you know is where the real viscosity is in any and in any political situation, and uh, and and where any kind of effort to direct the flow, the material uh, flow, uh, is going to find itself concentrated and directed, because the superstructure does determine and and change the base, but as I said, as a subsidiary action is generated from originally, and how that happens is much more contingent, that's where contingency lies, is in that superstructural relationship, and one of the big contingencies is fucking god damn it, Abraham Lincoln getting shot by that piece of shit fucking himbo and replaced by one of the worst men, honestly just one of the worst human. beings to ever occupy the presidency and that's saying a great deal because there are some monsters in there, but even like Andrew Johnson doesn't even have like some of the person virtues of the more charismatic or personable psychopaths who've been president uh and i and people have told me uh you know Lincoln and Johnson at the end of the day would have been that much different they were both racist i mean yes they were both racist but but andrew Johnson was Lincoln was ambiently racist in the way that all 19th century white males were. Johnson was pathologically and personally and like Nixonianly racist. uh and that he he was in a unique position as president in reconstruction to have that personal animous shape, shape the fucking clay that everyone came after one would have to build upon. oh god, can't get over it. oh, it's so bad. and the thing that's important about that the reason that that matters, and that's the reason that we need to have some sort of uh nuance when we think about these things, especially historically is that racism can be part of your decision matrix, but it might be subsidiary or it might be uh less influential than other aspects, it might get outvoted in your brain by other things, and whether it is or not uh is determined by the virulance of your racism, like that matters. at every level, like there are racists who voted for Barack Obama, you know, but the more racist you are, personally, the more aware you are of racism, the less likely you would have been probably to vote for Obama, so degree matters, I mean voting for Obama, not voting for Obama, uh, it's not the soul signal of one's like political virtue, but it does signal a willingness to cross a bear. of saying, yes, black president, i will be okay with that, that requires that your racism not be the thing that is deciding things for you at the level of politics, and and that is a thing that people are very uncomfortable with, the idea that because it suggests the idea that you might have to deal with people politically who are racist, you might not be able to clean everybody's brain through culture and make them all nice uh post anti-racist subjects before they can come together do politics, you might have to do politics with people who have racism in there as one of the things that they're reasoning with, but the challenge then is to overcome it, and one of the big reasons that neoliberal politics and all of its flavors including this radical, radical anti-racist uh, like apropessimism that essentially says that nothing but neoliberal accomodation is possible because of how racist white people are. "the thing that undergirs that is, you'll never be able to overcome racism, and as long as you're framing politics as the neoliberal zero some game that we are living in, the idea that it can only ever get worse and that is up to you to hustle and learn to code and and stay on your grind one way or another in order to survive, you'll never be able to overcome it. Twitch banned the word simp, that's funny, but anyway I'm very looking, I'm looking forward to the way that uh white weaves in uh protestantism and like mass mass religious uh uh conceptions into the charac into the stuff, because one of the things that any more successful reconstruction would have had to push against would have been that very protest constant liberal association between uh autonomy in the market and freedom of contract and the like the the conditions for virtuous living, there was a predominant sense that that by that point post second grade awakening when we like as a nation come to terms spiritually with being these atomized market workers whe might not even be to have our own land might have to sell our own labor to survive or sell our wares which you know can be a similar prostrate position uh we came to the conclusion that that those interactions are what reveal our worth as people reveal our uh our status is saved or damned and with that the case um the government intervention in the economy that would have been required to do reconstruction in any way more. viably would have been very difficult, it would have been hard, but the thing is it wasn't the only people thing people thought, there was there were other contending and conflicting uh uh values and that were culturally expressed and held in different ways and they could have been brought to bear to to insist upon uh the breaking of this notion of contract is freedom, because of course as white put shows very... clearly the post-war fixation on not allowing uh uh black dependents by not giving without uh uh without without giving to x slaves. first of all the idea that former slaves had not by virtue of their enslavement earned anything you could give them is absurd, i mean they they literally are the reason that those plantations existed. reason that that land was cultivated and the reason that there was any economic activity in those areas at all, so giving giving them land is in fact payment, it is a deferred payment, but beyond that absurdity is the compounding absurdity that giving shit to white people was the way that the fucking country had been built, and that's where racism comes in, but once again racism is part of a mosaic. of of conceptions and influences and interests that could have been arranged differently with different a different uh accumulation of events, and of course, as weight points out, the funniest thing about Andrew Johnson is that he was like many unionists in the south before the civil war, he hated the planter aristocracy because he was not one of them. like he had a Nixonian ship on his shoulder because he had been a low-born Taylor and he became wealthy and became a political figure, but he was never one of the one of those you know uh, one of those planter aristocrats who were very self-consciously trying to create a European style uh, a feudal uh social order on American soil, like they wanted to be they thought of themselves as the cavaliers from the fucking English civil war, they all thought they were little prince Ruperts of the Rhine. running around in their little hats with plums and a guy a drunk taylor like uh Andrew Johnson could never be one of them and so one of the reasons he stayed loyal to the union was he didn't want to fight uh to create a nation where they ran things and his idea for reconstruction was to uh was to put power into the hands of the the simple white people of the south because like a lot of white unionists he thought that the real victims of slavery were poor whites. Of course, that's half true, poor whites are the victims of slavery, but of course not the real or only victims of slavery, and that's that the refusal to see the bigger picture is is is is what racism does, that's its social function, is to obscure the reality uh and to allow for the division of workers, the division of the dispossessed against each other. and the reconstruction that Johnson pushed for that he thought would empower the simple white people of the south, what did it do? it put every kuzu covered fancy lad asshole in the south back in the saddle, back in power, way to go, good for you, Andrew, good for you. I don't care about cudzu, whatever, I don't live down there, it's too fucking humid, all right, so if anyone has any specific questions about what we've read, I'll pop in there, but I'm going to be wrapping up soon, uh, so for, I don't think there's going to be a stream next Wednesday, I think I'm taking some time off next week, uh, I've got. other things to attend to, but when I get back uh, let's do the let me look here, yeah, let's do the rest of part one, finish part one, so uh, chapters four through eight, that's a nice uh stopping point. The name of the book for those who are coming late is the republic for which it stands by Richard White. Well the most cringe counterfactual is the what is the Nazis had won the war because one they couldn't have and two they did. uh good book about the cold war in Africa? there actually are two books uh uh by this guy piero glagus uh and it's about cold war diplomacy in Africa and a lot of it and a lot of stuff about the Cuban intervention in the Angolan uh civil war. uh, one's called conflicting missions, Havana, Washington and Africa, eight, 1959 to 1976, and then there's another one, the sequel, visions of freedom, which is 76 to 91. "the only one ever got it right was uh the nazis winning the war right thing was philip k dick which when he said uh as soon as they got nukes they would have destroyed the world which yes" Why won't dump all right, this is the last question here, uh, why won't Trump go to jail in the state of New York, because he was president, presidents can't go to jail, when Nixon said, if the president does it, it's not illegal, he was right, in the sense that a president will never be um, criminally punished for anything they do in office. or once the president before, because no political system will allow that precedent, at least ours won't, ours will not, because if you start arresting them, then everyone's going to end up in jail, and that's why uh, i think it was "I think Felix told me that his dad had an idea that the president should the presidency should be one long-term, like 12 years or something, and then you're executed, because if Trump goes to jail, some fucking attorney general is going to try to put Obama in jail or Biden in jail and then you're off to the races and they don't want to start that uh precedent and I mean." and that's just like the political grandstanding, they sure as hell don't want the actual criminal behavior they they carry out to ever be accounted for, because then how are they going to decide to do this? the decisions these people make, the monstrous criminal decisions they make, are only they can only make them in a context of total impunity. if there was any potential possible uh uh consequence. for their actions beyond like oh i might lose an election, which you're going to lose off, you're going to leave office eventually, as in i might see my fortune taken from me, see my freedom taken from me, the way you know the rest of us have to decide to do things, like we have to decide what to do in a day-to-day basis, with the thing in our head of like, oh if we do the wrong thing we could get in trouble in a real like sense, in a real personal sense as in like forgetting like stat and i know these guys super care about status and winning elections, but there is a freedom that they need in order to operate in knowing that your personal security and the security of your fortune and your family and the it's never going anywhere, it can never be challenged, you're never going to see the inside of a jail cell, you're not going to get executed, you're not going to what, maybe some hippy hits you with a pie when you're at the aspins ideas festival, that's it, you can't make these decisions without that as you're. assumption and they're not going to do anything to violate that conflicting missions and visions of hope are the two or visions of freedom, conflicting missions and visions of freedom. or the two books about cold war uh foreign policy uh all right guys i'm gonna go so i'll do some more streams this week but next week it'll probably be dark just the heads up and then when we come back uh and i'll give a heads up ahead of this but like let's shoot for the wednesday after next the rest of h part one.
