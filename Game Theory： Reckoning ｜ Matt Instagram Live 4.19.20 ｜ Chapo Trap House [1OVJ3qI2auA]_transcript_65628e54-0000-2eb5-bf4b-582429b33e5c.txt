Leonard Cohen, Canada's answer to Bob Dillen. Ah, I'm not drunk, you're drunk. how you guys doing? let's see what the questions are. uh, man, i have seen the new biden ad, someone asked if i've seen the new bien and holy makral, holy shit uh, it's pretty funny. i mean, yeah, it's racist and that is bad, but uh, man, the thing it really indicates is that they're going to campaign. by taking all of Trump's principles and saying they're going to take all of Trump's like basic campaigning talking points and frames and say no uh because they can't offer an alternative they can't offer an alternative right now we're seeing this fucking recovery this this this uh this crisis economy being a giveaway exactly like it was in 2008 a giveaway to the richest people of the country we've got a fucking small business uh, we got a small business uh uh uh uh slush fund basically that's being raided by any corporate big corporation with a fucking um with a halfway competent uh attorney or uh accounting department people are gonna be completely left out sOL uh no no unemployment no uh no rent uh no rent uh jubilee. no debt uh, no debt jubile, you still owe everything, you'll what, you can get maybe some cobra, the cobra, and the thing about the cobra is you don't get it any cheaper, they just get paid more. um and what is the alternative? the alternative is uh Trump said that he would did a good job with the Chinese, but actually no, he did a bad job with the Chinese. Oh shit, really? Okay, so one way or another, we are all in agreement that this is about how much of it is China's fault, and who's going to be do a better job of uh confronting them over it. That's it, that's that's the solution. Not anything, not anything. could allow people to fucking survive this or have any hope of coming out of it and anything other than absolute penery, you fucking bleaches and scumbags a fucking potbelly subs got 10 million in loans from the small business fund, it's a complete fucking giveaway at every level, it's corporate looting like we haven't seen since 08 and there's no alternative to it, at least Obama pretended when he was running that he was against that shit and that he was going to do something different, of course, surprise, surprise, he did, he was lying the whole time, but you could be excused, I hope you can, because I certainly bought it, that he was envisioning something different. Biden is explicitly saying, no, we are on the same page with this, minimal fucking outlay of means tested uh, short-term benefits, meanwhile, and that is basically what falls off of the the wheel barrel that we're just delivering to the... fucking rapacious mods of all the fucking corporate raiters who always end up benefiting from all of this and guess what when all those small businesses are supposed to be helped by that loan when they are never able to get back in a business all those fucking restaurants that we all love those little guys those are all getting bought out at least the ones that are economically viable are going to get bought out by chains by by Amazon's going to get into the restaurant business i garan fucking to you and like the big the big uh uh the big chefs and the big uh uh like agribuus hell, I would be surprised of Monsanta the sides to get vertically integrated and open their own chain of fucking restaurants where like you pick like the hybrid chicken uh cauliflower, you pull it screaming off of the uh off of its like mutant uh hybrid freak uh impulical cord/root and just like cook it right in front of you, it's self-cooking actually, it has a little button on it, you press it and plumps while it stares at you, so like that's going to be the end of it. like this is this whole thing is going to be benefit to the ruling class if they can maintain stability, if they can make it so that money still means something that at the end of it they're going to be in a position to just buy out the economy basically at a fucking uh at uh fire sale prices and that's like that's what that's why they need to get hold now because you saw what happened with the fucking uh thing you remember when the uh the stock market went down remember biggest drop in human history well the reason that stopped and now that it's going back up is cuuse they've been signal the in the short term, they are going to be made whole, in the short term, they're not going, their debts aren't going to be called in, their profit streams are not going to dry up, they still get to maintain viability as corporations and that means that they can still make money and they can arbitrage off this, and that means at the end of this, if they're able to like keep suckers going out there and risking their lives for minimum wage to keep this thing going long because the the money that they're getting is supposed to have some worth because there's a uh because there's a government with actual like ability to function that like stands behind the debt that is implied by the note uh then they're going to come out of this winners uh because like there was a crisis in capitalism has been sinces and certainly one that has anticipated or uh only uh intensified since 08 and this is kind of a way out of it in a lot of ways this could be a way out of it because the only way out of a situation like that is to reduce competition. which is what they've been doing, but maybe not fast enough to keep themselve make themselves, keep themselves viable. now they get a chance where they could just buy out in a in a uh with a blink of the eye, nobody even noticing uh, in a crisis. uh, and they're going to be made whole, and and everyone is going to be in the reserve army of the unemployed, and there's going to be a UBI as some sort of part of this, by the way, that's inevitable, if the system maintains itself, UBI is going to happen, but it's going to most likely happen on their terms and this is going to be the thing that normalizes the UBI and it normalizes the corporate overthrow of like even the middle bourgeois, that's what it'll do. oh boy, getting real with you guys here, i wasn't expecting that, i got to say though, i think about it, i don't think i'm wrong, i don't think i'm wrong, because to stop it. there would be some sort, there has to be some counterveiling force at the table, somebody to enforce their will and for these guys to be scared of, and there just is it, Bernie has been defeated, his his uh his move. is in in in turmoil and it never wasn't it wasn't even big enough when it was at zenit before it started going down like the whole point of the Bernie thing in my mind like long-term like you know if I was was I putting on my like long-term sort of spingler ask decline of the west doomer hat that I kind of always believed even though I was like you know strategic or like tactically I might be up on something but at the long term I was always thinking none of this is going to actually work in any meaningful sense all it's going to do is push a process forward with and so that when the inevitable crisis of capitalism comes, like the the apocalypse of capitalism comes, that the left is in the strongest possible position to v for power in that situation, that was always my hope and dream, like that's what I thought Bernie was for, at the end of the day, like short term you can talk, yes, building, building socialism or building an idea of socialism in people's minds, giving them an idea the government can help them, providing them with uh uh things that make them feel empowered in their own workplaces so that they can organize as workers and gain class consciousness, that is the road, but man like I didn't think it was going to result in anything real, I didn't think we're going to get medicare for all, I don't think Bernie was going to succeed, I thought the ball was going to keep moving so that when the crisis came, the left was in a position to win, and now I feel like this really does feel like it could be the crisis, and if it is, I despair basically for where we are, it doesn't feel like it's enough. but I don't know, I don't know, there's no real way to know, so that's me, so that's me guys, that's where I am right now, how are you guys doing? I mean it says not the crisis yet, but we don't know what this is the beginning of, we certainly know what, we don't know what the long-term effects of this stucking thing are col and especially colliding with climate change and like the and then the independent facts. that there's a fucking fossil fuel uh uh economy crisis that no one is uh saw coming where where where like the fossil fuel economy the entire carbon economy the petro dollar is collapsing how about that you put all this to shit together yes capitalism is very durable and it certainly has institutions that are built now to do its bidding in this situation but i got to say this is a real challenge it's a real challenge i think we can at least accept that at least i hope I hope we could, uh, all right, I'm looking for another good question, uh, have the podjons ever gotten, no, man, fuck that, pod Johns have never acknowledged any of us other than say we suck, uh, and to tell us to shape up, ah, fucking turds. I don't know if you should quit your hospital job, I don't know what it is, I don't know how how supported you feel, I don't how much money you're getting. What states are the caucases? Oh, Appalatia, that's easy. No, no, yeah, that's that's that's a no-brainer. The midwest of the Balkans and the caucases, uh, uh, Dagistan, Chechni and all that shit, uh, yeah, that's Appalacia, for sure. West Virginia, Kentucky, all down the way through with Missouri, yep, yeah, where the Americans, where where Day Lawrence's American spirit. lives, the hard desolate killer, the scotch irish border weaver, yeah, those guys are the most like chechins, honor-bound, uh, uh, warlike, religiously static, come on, it's it's very good, it's it's it's it's scance, i don't know about the other ones, like i don't know what uh, like i don't know what i oh, i think Ohio, oh no, wait, no, oh I'm sorry uh Pennsylvania I think uh that's kind of I feel like all right new England is England right right New England is just England or like the UK and Ireland the British Isles right the British Isles is New England right that seems correct and then does that make the mid atlantic and like the east coast like continental Europe like France or uh or Italy maybe just because there's all those italians. I don't know. are the are the dems about to be a permanent minority party? uh, it's interesting. uh, I don't know, I think that there's this argument being made that they're like trying to become the new natural ruling party of capital, they're like trying to userp the role from the republicans, that's why there's this right word shift is because they're making a play to be the real uh thing of capital and to like... reify uh like social liberalism as uh as like the backbone of the legitimacy of the of like the neoliberal state you know like like wokeness becomes like the divine right of kings wokeness becomes the the reason for the legitimacy of the sovereign like it's not it doesn't derive from god it derives from the fact that they they observe certain forms about about like cultural diversity and shit like that. but the problem is is that they have this crisis and democrats are bad and crisis when when they are forced to promise things they know they're not going to do. meeting a uh hard boiled egg, that's really a simple but delicious treat, i got to say, yes, hein brood, that is really, that's what Biden would feel like to me, you know, the last guy, uh, I'm eating an egg in these trying times. I only brought one egg out because I thought uh, I'm going to have dinner soon, but damn it, I want another egg, they're really good. Uh, you know what, somebody asked an interesting question, they said, should you be rooting for Trump over Biden? Now, a lot of people have accused us of like being closet outrriders or like trumpist or something. Trump. becomes so polarizing a figure on like racial and and uh gender lines that saying that you should vote for Trump or saying like objectively that like a Trump win would be better than a Biden one uh it is better to adopt a buddhist posture it is better to point out one it doesn't matter who you vote for a personal level it's lib bullshit to think that that is meaningful like indication of your worth as a person your symbolic like people think that, they think that their vote is them, and that's silly, it's just an act, it's just a booswais, honestly if we look at a culturally, it's a bourgeois ritual affectation, that's what voting is, so who gives a ship if you do it or not, or what you do when you do it, let the election pass through you, like gamma radiation, now that bernie isn't there, we are the record producer in boogy nights, this is a yp, not an MP. so that's my attitude just to not get bound up because I see people like they're already getting riled up about oh I'm going to have to fight these bidon people for the next six months it's like you've been fighting these Hillary people over the same point for the last four years do you see an end to this do you see this ever meaning anything do you see this ever resolving do you see this anything other than just permanent self-inflicted uh uh hysteria like a self-inflicted uh neurosis, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it open up, let it go, it's my advice, people go, what about the biden, what about least harm, what about mehed, does it matter, dust in the wind, we are shadows and dust, maximus, shadows and dust, Sands through the hourglass, those are the votes of our lives, who gives a shit, bourgeois affectation, like neckties at work, that's what voting is, it's a thing you watch your social betters do, little curtees, court curteses that that like legitimize them each other in their ritual performance of power, while most people observe That's it, it's a debutant ball, it could be useful because of its cultural power as an organizing tool, which is what we try to do with Bernie, but that part, whatever future use elections have, and they do have some, I'm not saying fuck electoralism, I think that you need elections, you need to work with those systems, every Lenin did that, everyone understands the necessity of that, it's all neurotic shit to say no to that, um, uh, but I'm just saying that the your interest in this election is over, so you're not going to be doing anything for it right, you're not going to be donating time or money for this fucking guy, that's a given, you're not going to giving him any of your time or attention meaningfully, so what are you going to do, spend this time arguing with Biden supporters who are not operating in good faith or do you just start grilling, do you get grill pilled, do you just? the jimmy buffett lifestyle, do you just waste away in Margaritaville? searching for that loss shaker is salt. let's do it. that's what i'm planning to do guys, so let's get grilling. let's get it grilling. hashtag, let's let's get grilling. no, maybe not. i don't know, something grilling related. let's think of a grilling related hashtag. grill pill, i don't know, whatever. so that's the that's the argument, that's the to tell people. of fucking voting in this election, because I can see people already just like, even though this is a crucial moment in history and we really have to figure out what to do next, pronto, people are wasting time arguing with Biden voters about this point, we need to focus, this is like our response now could determine the fate of humanity, I mean I'm not being hyperbolic there, if we can seize this chance, I mean I'm not saying it's likely, but if it's possible, it requires focus right now, and talking aboting supporters about... this fucking head on a pin bullshit about who's actually you know that's actually privileged of you to say that you can vote, well no, it's actually privileged of you to say that because most people who are not privileged are the ones no, grill on that shit, get to the real thing we have to figure out, we have to figure out how to respond to this, i mean a lot of people say things like mutual aid or fucking uh taking the burny campaign and and turning it into a a thing for local races and and and things like that um any of it, it has to happen very quickly, the structures have to be in place so if the pressure gets put on them, they can take the weight, they don't just disperse and then the great big powers just roll everything up into one great god, horrifying consolidation, so my god, let's get to that business right now, so I'm not hearing anymore bullshit about the Biden campaign, don't care, in fact I'm going to try to like stop myself. from even tweeting about it, I do love making fun of all that bullshit, but from now on, I'm not going to talk about the race, I will make fun of something Biden or Trump says, but not in the context of which one you should vote for or anything, um, or maybe I won't even do that, maybe I'll totally boycot it, uh, I think maybe just like as a as a as a piece of self-discipline, I should enforce on myself, no, you're not going to say anything about either of them, no matter how funny they are, and Trump and Biden are two of the funniest people. earth and guess what i can't say i won't watch the debates of course i will and i might have to stream them because i'm going to be on a lot of drugs but that because it is such a perfect culmination of everything i've ever believed in i have to give myself that but other than that i'm ignoring this campaign talking about everything else oh we got a lot to talk about there's a lot to talk about uh and i can't wait to talk about it but this specific campaign we're not talking about at least i am we might talk about the show you cuuse it is a news of the week thing uh but i'm going to remind everyone during that that you don't have to have opinions about this stuff see if we got any questions here thoughts are the ending of meridian to the internet do siaps If Button win is a future confrontation with China, is a oh, I talked yesterday about China and I'm kind of skeptical that there's going to be any kind of apocalyptic conflict just because our economies are so interdependent and the elites are so intertweed uh and their interests are so interlocked, it's like there's really nothing other than just sort of pathetic like nation state shadow boxing to require this system to have this much grit in it, they make the stuff we purchase it. It's symbiotic, it works both ways, it's like they they get to build a domestic economy uh uh through export, we get to cheap goods uh at the expense of our industrial core, of course... in the long run it's destabilizing because it's not it's you know second law thermodynamics the system eventually starts eating itself and then it fucking destabilizes but the interests at the top are the same so i really think that this is all going to end up being uh some sort of sino-american uh uh uh higem i think that's the most it's just unless unless the chaos theory really has gone around the b and it could have i mean trump being president is not something most people would have predicted even using like the most you know loose definitions of of probability back before it would have been happening, and this guy does have the power, I mean he he's he is a actual actor in history, which is insane to think that Donald Trump is one of those guys like Napoleon, you know, who literally has history in his hands, his history uh in the art behind the tanka truck wheel, it's breathtaking to think that, and it's just an indectment of the system that it's come to this, I mean this is the ultimate repudiation of every system that we live under capitalism, liberalism anything, the uh the fucking enlightenment for god sakes, the industrial revolution, uh, the technology all, like it could turn you in a complete ledy for god sakes, but it's the reality we're in, that's crazy and it's horrifying to think of, but we got to think of something to do in this conflict, or in this moment of uh insecurity, oh boy. Ah, woo, feeling it guys, how are you guys doing, how you living? I was gonna say something else, but I forgot, I forgot what to say, ooh, dark tower Buddhism, okay, all right, strap in guys, so the long and short of it is is that i a while ago had a few religious style revelations that pointed me in the direction of Buddhism is the closest repository uh on earth of like eternal truth or wisdom of any kind uh and as but the problem is is i i have a very hard time uh acting on those beliefs through things like meditation and you know rigorous uh uh abstamiousness or anything really um and part of that is that the is like the cultural vocabulary of uh of Buddhism is very um very alien to me uh doesn't really resonate you know and all of the ideas like you know people you know and like a shinto like a shrine with like the ball like sitting there and like that stupid music with the flute you know I don't like that music and I know that the... obviously it's not my monolithic culture, i'm just talking about what my preconditioned brain stamp relates to it, you know what i mean, like i have, i only know buddhism the degree that i know anything, which is through a cultural context, and that means i get like an association of images mostly from television, uh, like a literal stereotype, so that's why i'm operating off, because i don't have a deeper cultural awareness of it because of where i grew up, so that's like a barrier, but then i've realized uh that... the dark tower world of Stephen King, books I have read at a young age, so we're like integrated into my mintal landscape, very early period, uh, absolutely contain a lot of the same elements, uh, ideas of um, you know, eternal recurrence, that uh, the idea of like uh, of uh, evolution towards a higher plane of enlightenment, uh, through and turtle, the turtle seems like the turtle who's back, the earth is on, uh, he's like, buddha is like, I don't like that guy, but I like the turtle, so I just think of the turtle, anyway, I did. watch the NSNL zoom party, it was really terrible, uh, really, really bad, uh, made me, made my tummy hurt a little bit, it really sucked, sucked a lot, uh, thumbs down, uh, it really reminds you how much they're pushing that audience to get the jokes, you know, like to get like, if they didn't have a live audience, that show would never have made it past a year, because thing is, the thing, obviously, the real secret of SNL is that it was never good, there is never a time when sNL was in any objective or meaningful sense good uh. uh there are just times that are remembered more fondly by people because of the placement in their lives, you usually see because it's an eternal thing, you see SNL when you're a little kid, and that version of the show is so formative to your like sense of humor and and like cultural context that you give it this outsized uh uh place at your heart, and then you remember the best parts and forget the worst, and that's true of every era of SNL, no matter how much we love it now, will... Baro era which I love of course and a lot of people in this chat I get best had a lot of fucking stinkers. Now I do think as someone has watched it my whole adult life that there isn't been a notable dropoff in the last couple years. I will say it's a little worse than it's ever been uh but the thing is it was never as good as as the people who compare the bad new ones to was uh but you know there's always going to be a couple of of decent sketches in every season and but no, but like it needs to feel social, it needs to have everyone laughing, he needs to like be pumping if anything up that way, and just having them just on those zooms, oh my god, every one of these zoom base shows they had that fund raiser yesterday, which god bless them, they raised a bunch of money, but watching these people in their these musicians get into their costumes and dance in front of featureless walls, it's just a bunch of people, it's a bunch of... people on chat chatterbait like live streaming their mental breakdowns, it was very, it's like, oh, this is not reassuring at all, this is terrifying, it just reminds you of how wildly isolated we are, and that's the thing that's most disheartening to me about the future is that this is a moment where solidarity is more important than it's ever been, and social solidarity has been rendered basically impossible, unless you've got an ar-15 and own an arby's franchise and really want to get that money going because you got payments, you basically are not in a public context, you're either working, dodging coronavirus, to keep your family alive, or your home, neither of those allow for any kind of solidarity, any kind of like public demonstrations of anything, workplaces lose have are at all-time low for leverage in most businesses because of how many people are unemployed now, amazon's hiring 100,000 people because a lot of the people have are sick and or are staying home because they don't want to get sick and so there spots are being plate spots are being taken by people who are more desperate who are more willing to work in those conditions because they're in a more desperate uh monetary position than the people who just recently had those jobs that no longer can afford in their own minds to go to work, that's terrifying, that's terrifying to contemplate, so that's the big question and i don't that's why i think that's so hard to formulate answers to the what is to be done question because so much of it depends on obsolete it's looking like social forms you know like the public person like the the public puman was like our only antripo into uh solidarity and empathy and all the things that build a social order now we're retreating to just a situation where we've completely abolished the social there's no social uh component at all and now how are we supposed to fight in this terrain that's en created is a superstructure of capitalism, like we're fully superstructural now, we've complete like huge chunks of us have lost any contection to the actual mode of production, it's wild shit people and I don't know what to say, it's my party and it's freaking me out, so anyway I hope everybody be thinking of questions and I hope everybody tries to think of answers to these questions, but don't spare any brain power you don't need to on the fucking presidential election, that's my only request to you, for both of our sakes, for all of our sakes, just pay it no mind, gone fishing, that's a YP, not an mp. You know the uh, the uh the military coue. uh might take us a little bit left hilariously uh a military coup partially because of the uh fact that the military is actually the most diverse institution in America at its base like the people make it up uh but uh also just out of the fact that like there will be an apolitical need to uh like distribute social goods it's such a way to maintain order that will superseed a lot of the uh the gunk in the system that's the built a by the the the reality of like a political culture, like having democrats and republicans and creating ideologies around them and then people investing them to one degree or another with validity and then reifying them through law. that creates a gunk that like breaks between makes it hard to like fully uh uh exploit. so that means that they would like have they would in an a-political way just like distribute stuff. so yeah, it might actually be sort of a populist uh uh uh military cuw. i mean, i'm not i don't not nearly as ideological or as a left wing as like the carnation revolution, certainly not. uh, but uh honestly maybe it might be, I hate, it could be the thing that saves us ultimately, depending on how things were to to fall out, it could be the thing that saved people from fascism, by by by uh cutting off mass politics before it beco become fully uh realized uh and fully uh captured by nativism, you know, but that's only like a worst case scenario of course, I think I don't think we have to go to that, I think we can we can create social uh durable social uh orders that can take over some responsibility and get some power and leverage in this coming uh negotiations about like the reorder that's to come so uh yeah american bathism i mean oh boy yeah frederic Jamison's been on this for a long time. uh, it's it's certainly uh, the the argument is not wrong, like there is a uh, there like the va is the only actual socialized medical care in the American system, it is, it is uh, not single payer, it is owned by the state, va doctors work for the US government, that's like the fucking NHS, that's the domesticast, that was my favorite thing for my our interview with Joe Cstach is we asked him about... about what do you think about universal healthcare? and he said, well, I think we should experiment, and I feel like we should try some medicare for all is a good idea, but also, and I was assuming he was setting me up to say uh, the thing that like all those people said, which is well give it, well basically a way to say a public option, you know, we'll we'll do competition between the private and the public sector, that just means public option, even though if you call it medicare for all, but instead he said, we should have medidare for all and then have it uh in competition with the va and expand the va. and i was like that's just direct provision you're talking about so i was like damn joe go off uh i mean like i said uh if if joek could be our horthi i think there are worse outcomes of this crisis i'll tell you that but anyway like and there's a social culture there's an actual uh spreed a core uh uh there's chain of command and their social provision for everything food to medical care to uh housing? uh, I don't, no, I don't know, probably not going to happen. I don't think that we've got these stacks in here anymore, I think they're all a bunch of time-serving motherfuckers, I think there are a bunch of uh, just lizard people. I mean, honestly, kind of the fact that they haven't coed Trump yet kind of tells me that they don't have any heart, that they don't have the balls to do it, or they're like, they've been conditioned, there, I mean, there's this new book by this guy. uh, there's this new book by a guy who's like a 40-year uh tenure professor at west point who uh is is doing a book that just exposes the institutions as the entire time i've been there all the institution is done has created is is created a bunch of mediocre yes men dipshit zombies who just stumble into one failing campaign after another losing to one collection of like shoeless insurgents after other because they all they do is replicate uh like the worst heard instinct idiocy uh of the us military culture and i think yeah that's that's now who's in charge they don't even have the fucking balls or even imagination to conceive of themselves like like like i bet they even think that things like well we couldn't coo the president that would be against the constitution like they actually think that you know they believe like they actually in their hearts would think that. and that would stop them from doing it, that's the kind of imagine, like imaginationless just dults, guys who cannot think outside of any box, don't even know that there is a box, just pissing in the corners of the boxes and not even staying to one, pissing in all the corners and not even like making a piss zone that's so it's less bad in the rest of the room, I don't know the name of the book, I'm sorry, I guess I could look it up, I haven't read it, I just read an interview with the author, but uh, it certainly makes sense, i mean those guys have not won a war in 30 years, seriously, these motherfuckers are like oh and 50 right now in like in since the 20th century ended, what was the last war they won, the last war they won, what bombing Kosovo, where they by the way didn't even prevent any of the atrocities, the worst atrocities all were committed after the bombing started, so they didn't even stop it, but so the... created Kosovo, that was the last big w for the US military. fought to an absolute draw by the taliban for 20 years, if we do get out of this thing and I hope we do, it'll be with the taliban going to take over as surely as the north was going to take over South Vietnam as soon as we left, that means that's a loss, that's an L. Taliban was the government we replaced, so that's an L, that's not even you, like some people can say like, oh, you know, well we'. no, this is a, l, Iraq, I mean, what was the point of that? I mean, if you take the actual mission, it was like one of those, it's a brain teaser, it's like, did we win the war in Iraq or lose it, it's like, well, the reason we were supposed to go there, doesn't exist, so like the thing we were there for is in a real thing, and now that we know that, there was no justification, which means there's no way to say whether it was a victory or defeat, it literally nullifies. because you're not judging it by a criterion anymore, because it's like, well we stop the weapons, but there were no weapons, it defeats the question, that's how bad it was, that's how bad and disastrous a war it was and now the country is much more influenced by Iran than us, which wouldn't be a problem if we were smarter and decided to just flip sides in the middle east and join up with Iran against Saudi Arabia and Israel, has anyone thought of that by the way, could we just do? that couldn't we just do a fay a face turn like in the WWF uh, so a bunch of losers, losers, I have no imagination, like the smartest one of them, the guy was like... the genius of the whole generation was fucking david trayaus whose big genius idea was, hey, let's just give those guys money so they stop shooting at us, and it only worked as long as they had the money directly in front of them, and as soon as we left, they just just became al-Qaeda, or they became ISIS, oops, shit, oh no, uh, who do thunk it, so he literally just like did a temporary cheat uh to get out of like a bad uh press, it was really just to get out of a bad press era, it was basically to provide. the surge existed to get what Nixon and uh uh Kissen Jor was looking for when they were doing the Paris uh peace negotiations which was a reasonable interval because they had accepted as a fan plea that the south would fall they just wanted it to not fall like the day after we left they wanted there to be what those called reasonable interval and that is all that uh the surge provided so that was his big genius innovation was to do that and then uh so that that was it and then he went home and he gave all of his classified information to the journalist that he was having sex with and it was only found out because his real housewife from tampa uh threw a fucking a glass of chartine in someone's face because they were spending too much time with the general i mean come on that is their guy that's their uh solomani uh that's their uh uh that's their wallen give me a fucking break good lord - uh, that's their francisco sforsa, bitter lake is an adam Curtis documentary about the Saudi uh western uh alliance, which was forged uh after world war 1, very bad idea for everyone involved. All right, I'm looking up that book, I got to look up that book, uh, west point, it should be called like disow, west disappointed, no, never mind. Okay, it's called the cost of loyalty, dishonesty, humorous and failure in the US military by Tim. back it, apparently this guy kind of has a uh has a this is kind of a crank buse uh he had to like fight he had to go to court to get tenure uh buse they like denied it to him or something and he he was able to claim that it was uh unfounded and they had to give him the job back so he's got a ax to grind but everything you said makes sense to me i mean look at the record we suck we really suck. Oh boy, I would go on Blace and Liz's stream if they wanted me to, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, if if I don't think they're, I don't think you, I don't want to invite. myself, so I don't know if they are, if that's if you're if you're not speaking for them, I can't say, working 925, what a way to make a living. Oh boy, I'm in the stable with the horses, yes, I'm a horseman. People make fun of him, they think he's a nerd, but like, I honestly feel like he's onto something visave a lot, like buse obviously a lot of leftists are very down on uh European institution. what they should, they're awful uh, international institutions, they are dog shit, uh, they're awful, they perpetuate capital, that's how they're there, they're bad, but the thing is is that like i really feel that the crisis were certainly sake were certainly we're seeing and i was talking about this long before fucking coronavirus, mainly i was thinking of climate change on the issue of climate change alone, and now we have fucking coronavirus where it's only even more underscored that international cooperation is going to be one of the most so important because how none of these things can be dealt with nation state level, the fucking virus can go around borders with ease and you cannot have an a national policy on on on a climate with the rest of the world not signed on because it's going to happen, it's going to get keep going elsewhere, so it has to be cooperation, what it looks like is the question uh and i think there but so like i think you know anti-eu leftists you know like brexitite here lefts i sympathize with those ideas but i think a lot of them are focused on the idea like we got to undermine these institutions but I don't think enough question has been, enough uh, enough thought has been put into the question of what do you replace them with, because I feel like if you just fall back on the nation state, it's just going to be make it harder, it's going to make it harder to turn to to do any kind of the organizing we're going to need, and I will say that verfacuus theory of like get in these institutions take them over, I mean obviously ironic it would be funny for me to say, I don't think that's a good idea when they say, oh isn't that what you were doing with Burnie, it's like, well fair enough, I think maybe like the our question is just like, the degree to which it's a viable option, I mean his election results indicated might not be very viable, but I would give him credit just because he's asking the question, he's like, what are we going to do about these international institutions? if we just break them up and replace them with nothing, I don't think that's good, what are if I'm fine if somebody has got an idea for alternatives, but I need to know what those would be, and we need to start talking about them and try to move towards making them possible, uh, or or we what are we going to do with these ones that exist, uh, so I'm, I, I don't know enough about the EU to say definitive. whether I think it's a good idea or whether it's a waste of energy uh, but I can just say that I appreciate that anyone is looking to answer that question of how to do left internationalism, because I agree that what has been has failed, but it has to be replaced with something, and I think people more people need to be talking about what that is, so that's just my, that's my uh take on that. Well, Oh yeah, god, I'm going to have that, this, I might do it on stream one of these nights, if I go late, if you catch me on the right time, I might do this on my on the stream, and it'll be the most terrifying and traumatic experience any of you will ever have, it will make the arbud dwyer footage, look like an episode of Captain Kangarou. man, I loved RC cola, it's got real sugar, delicious. uh uptin sanclare's 34 book title uh well he had the first one the one he wrote to run for governor was i i governor and how i how i ended poverty uh and then he wrote one called uh how i got licked which i love the title of yeah i expect that episode sometime in the next two weeks i think i'm already about halfway through this book i'm reading for it and it's a great it's not only is it really just a fascinating story there are so many historical residences i'm not even gonna I'm going to try to be as as uh subtle as possible with these, I'm going to try to make them clear without underlining them too much, but I really feel like they're going to pop the historical residences, the riming of history, the tragedy and farse of the whole damn thing, so uh, that should be fun, I think I'm going to call it epic. fail, if you know anything about uh, sinclair, you'll see how hilarious that is. i do like the mountain goats, john darnial, hell helsman, uh, all i know about Frank loud write is that uh, as a as a bulcan midwesterner, i always have to have been competition with the other states uh, in the area, and so frankly write is a wisconsin. first and formost which means when relisting guys from Wisconsin guys and women from Wisconsin who are cool and have like good shit I can be like Frank right number one in architecture what do you got Minnesota where's your Frank Loy right you don't got one boom. uh, I hope I hope sir, is did she did she win? did they have the election yet? I didn't think they had, I'm rooting for her, certainly, I don't know if it happened or not, I'm certainly rooting for her, even though she is a little too warren uh, Warren's curious for my liking, uh, you know, hey, who didn't say I wasn't magnanimous, look how damn magnanymous I am. Give me a lawyer man, I want Bill Councelor, Ron Cooby, no, McConnell will never lose in Kentucky, no, he's there forever. brings home the bacon, he brings home the bacon and the snow, i have read delilo, how dare you read delilo? i'll read your delilo, motherfucker, tell me to read delilo, oh if you mean on the stream, yes, never mind, that's a good idea, i actually might, oh, i'm sorry, i'm sorry for that, uh, now i think about it, yes, little would be good, something about the airborn toxic event, maybe the movie for my twitter banner is boogy nights, it's the scene where uh Dirk and uh and uh Derk and Brock go to get the tapes that they've been recording the fire tapes of the fire sessions of the songs i've been recording uh and uh there's producer won't give them because they haven't paid uh their their their studio time and they're saying you got to give us the tapes we're going to sell them they're going to be huge and you know they're great feel feel feel feel heat read read rock child yes and the guy goes that's a that's not an mp that's a yp your problem and they go these np yps i don't know these industry terms please. and he goes, you can't have him, that's it, so that is my embodyment, my best self, during this whole campaign, will be saying that and thinking it whenever anyone is trying to get my dander up about biden versus trump contest, that is why my favorite little uh thing to be replying to anybody whining about this shit to me, any democrat whining and catterwalling to me about my choice to vote or not vote for their candidate, it will be met with the still image of the record producer. and father of Robert Downey Jr. uh, just cross the arms, that's a yt, not an mp. That's it, it's a yp baby, ah, hell yeah, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel the heat, organized election boycots or not, see that's an interesting question, I have heard several people say that it would be better uh, if there is going to be a mass abstention from Biden. it makes sense for it to be self-conscious and try to expand itself so that there could be a noted and pointable uh um cost to doing what the democrats did to Bernie and I think there's something to this this I actually think oh shit I'm almost out of time damn it uh actually you know what tomorrow I'll start by talking about that so tune in and I will I'll be I'll you what I'll spend the time because I haven't been thinking about it I don't want to go off the top of the head now that I think about it cuz I think this is a real big question really uh um is the degree to which you can create a quantifiable cost for doing what the democrats did because let's not forget what they did was they killed people and they threaten to kill more people and they intervened in every level of the process from the the tallying to uh having voting uh open certain areas uh closing and opening election uh uh uh polling sites uh of course the collusion with the media which if we got some licky leaks again holy shit. just blow the doors off everything I guaranteed to you, all these things came together, um, and they need to be some sort of like consequence for that, and if we could say this is the number that could have been yours, instead of speculating, uh, that that might mean something, of course you have to know that you're going to make a big enough bike to show strength and not do the opposite, you don't want to remind them that you're you could be ignored, that would suck, so I don't, I'll... about it, anyway, nice talking guys, bye-bye, i think i'll put this one on youtube tomorrow, so bye-bye guys.
