 oh got the best of my love oh you got the best of my love oh you got the best of my love oh you got the best of my love. out in the cool with this. red right hand, i swear to god i used to know the lyrics to more songs, i think they got pushed out of my head, or that part of my brain died, i think that's more likely, uh, i think that's statistically more likely to be the case, but you know what, i'm just going to go with there's like finite amount of brain room and uh some... that got popped out in favor of others and you know what i'll take what i've got, it's working for me so far, we'll see, one thing is when i was a kid i used to like try to set about memorizing song lyrics, like i didn't even do it passively, i would write them out and stuff, now i don't listen to enough music to have it happen to have the reinforcement, even to the old stuff that i used to remember, i don't, i stopped, i don't listen to much music. because i used to, i probably should fix that, i i need to like get away from my old deal, which is like i couldn't really enjoy a song unless i could sing along to it, like i have to be singing, i have to be producing you know some sort of uh part of it and a verbal part. like I've realized over the years that I'm my brain is incredibly uh unbalanced in uh you know uh like intuitive uh stuff like things that make sense things that uh things that are like relatively easy to grasp they are all connected very specifically to to. to the English language which is incredibly fucking narrow plank to build uh your life around uh, but I've managed, the rest of my brain is just very bad, I mean it's not just that it's bad, it's that I'm also a lazy fat American swine who was never forced to you get better uh, get more uh in touch with certain things, I was able to kind of float. And so here I am with just an ossified brain, it's just getting getting smaller by the day, it's doing the anti-rich piano, oh well, but this is just a way to say that like pure music by itself, I don't know, because I I stop listening to music and i started listening to podcasts, but uh, now i don't even really listen to that many podcasts, like two or three at the most, and really only when i'm exercising, maybe i should listen this some more classical, like the opposite of what i'm used to, just pure moods as they say. Okay, so today we're going to talk about the part, third part, I believe of making a global capitalism, uh, which is all about the crisis of the 70s, and how it starts to break up this uh, internationalized new deal structure that had built the post war economy, because that is really how they describe it and I think it is an effective. way to imagine it is is that the that the uh post war uh western sort of labor peace that defined the politics of that generation. uh was a internationalization of the new deal, because the United States thanks to its specific balance of class forces and resources uh was able to synthesize the contradictions of capitalism much more effectively than the European powers were uh or Japan for that matter, they were two, they were playing catch-up in a lot of ways with the United States, in the fascists, in the case of the fascists literally, I mean World War II was... the tale of uh capitalist development in western Europe and Japan, which you know by the late 1800s is has caught up to Europe uh, in like the capitalist race uh, the tale, the last ones to get it, the last ones to uh create a geographically like extended sphere of influence, not just a capitalist economy, crucially, a sphere of influence, they were the last ones. which means they were sucking hind tit and they were banging up against established spheres of influence, so boom, they went to, they went, they had to uh, their internal contradictions pushed them outward to war, and that made them not a viable host for capitalism, not stable enough, it's the way that viruses don't really want to be deadly, that's not genetically advantageous to her virus to kill a lot of the people it infects, because that limit. the amount of transmission that the host could do by its death and the death of the viruses is within it. uh, like, so if you have like a a virus just rampaging through a body like ebola, that's capitalism ripping through the societies of Germany and and Japan, uh, the losers of World War One, the economic, not even the uh, like actual battle. losers, the economic loss of World War One, because that's the thing with Italy, Italy was technically on the on the on the winning side of World War One, but they didn't get that much out of it, and that defined their uh, you know, crisis ridden economy after the war, so by the time you get the big crisis of capitalism, the internal structures of these fascist nationalist states that could not uh resolve. socially the contradictions at its heart, right? because uh, the premiseers to maintain the nation as like this uh, axis of identity, as opposed to class interest, which means you keep embedded in this structure, this class antagonism defining your society, which like is what drives it to its extremes of violence, but that violence, although yes, there is a domestic regime of terror, it has to be exceeded. by a campaign of uh external violence, buse someone is everyone is hurting in these structures, everyone is being massively alienated in these structures uh, and yes, Spain is another good example, they didn't even fight in the war, but they were still way behind the pack economically by the uh, by the time the real crisis of uh capitalism in the 30's hits. so so capitalism running through these rampaging through these systems right, where these nationalist structures are being forced to dump off the alienation through uh economic regimes that are capitalism wedto a state project of expansion, like they keep capitalism, but with this overarching nationalist agenda that is in in direct conflict with the interests of capitalism, which is international which is the extension across the entire globe of a single common market space, which is the opposite of the sort of defined geographic zones of influence and power and domination that these uh these late commerers to the imperial race are producing, so they've got ebola, the western democracies that can't really defend themselves, they've got uh uh, they've got like maybe small pox. or how what's something typhoid cholera? and then we have got uh the common cold, the United States got the common cold, now capitalism is traveling through our fucking system at light speed uh, because it has synthesized those contradictions, because that violence is being carried out by someone who can't speak up for themselves, somebody who isn't part of the integrated uh uh global system, someone who cannot add their uh like resistance to the cause. benefit ledgers of capitalism, the excorporated native Americans, and and enslaved africans, that's the secret so you've created now a American polity where everybody has this sense of themselves as citizens of a country that has their best interest at heart where the thing that what's best for the government is best for the economy is best for me these are all the same things that's a thing you can believe in only in this context though of American development where the people feeling the... really sharp edge of the stick of alienation are not part of the fucking polity, that's the difference between like the US treatment of blacks and Germany's treatment of Jews is that Jews have been fully fucking assimilated into European society German society since Napolian or at least since 1848 uh yeah there's still discrimination but it is not. systematic, then they have to go in and throughout this body politic pick a scape goat, and Jews were an acceptable scapecoat, they were unsympathetic to many Germans, because their survival strategy in this mailstrom had been to grab on to those things that will help you advance through uh the the the struggle of in the marketplace, in America. we never had to have that ritualized finding of a escape goat, because there is this seamless in this pure conception of American Americanism that like wasn't universally held like there's racism, discrimination at all levels, but that reproduced a generalized sense of American identity that transcended their uh self-conception as members of a class, this didn't happen in Germany, at least not. with ireland that prefigured the American colonial relationship uh was able to like uh vent social uh uh gases basically uh and build uh machinery of domination and of uh you know marketization uh in these excorporated spaces. so the new deal is what this looks like in terms of a uh a treaty basically between America's working class as part of a greater uh uh category of uh non-capital owning Americans which goes from like artisans uh uh proletarians even like I would say yoman farmers who are self-sufficient compared to those people who like have massive concentrations of capital uh like that that group of people who understood themselves to be part of one polity making a deal with capital and with government this like these the state and capital the two faces of one greater thing. that uh hegemoneny allows us only to interact with across this like uh through this janis screen right? like we are only allowed as Americans to see capital as either the market or the state at one time we can only ever address one or the other at one time which masks the fact that they're the same thing at a deeper more fundamental level that determines their relationship to each other and their relationship to you, so crisis of capitalism that causes uh genocide uh and uh world war in Europe and Asia kills a third of the world's population or whatever, not that much, it kills a bunch of people uh, and in America, get this thing that can fight that war, win that war and then come out basically unsky, so this project we're talking about making global capitalism, at first is taking that administrative new deal state. and applying its structures to the economies of these uh recently uh traumatized countries and the peripheral and of course as they come into the market the post colonial periphery as they're being like offloaded by their colonial overseers can no longer afford them, the direct empire is no longer affordable, it has to be made efficient and it is made efficient by the introduction of American market structures to replace formal regimes of power, and that means allowing Europe to be basically a little sandbox, a little fantasy, fake uh, a political economy, where people got to pretend that they were fighting over you know control of means of production, that were actually controlled in Washington, and they can carry out those politics because this machine waar building is dumping capital into these countries, Europe specifically more than anybody, dumping fucking capital into it. oh through these new structures that are extensions of the new deal state, and that allows them to rebuild this social democratic consensus that is more more advanced and more civilized than ours, but only because the exploitation at its heart has been abstracted away to the imperial core that's actually carrying out the final decision making that set the term for all the other politics that happens in Europe and anywhere else. and so by the mid-60s you're seeing the first uh shutters of this machine because it's packed with contradictions and those contradictions are going to work themselves out over time which means different conditions are going to uh a condition of of entropy is going to enter into to this uh new system that has been established entropy starts as soon as you establish bretton woods and it drives through the system uh all th this boom period that builds this robust global capitalist nexus with these uh social democratic or social democratic trending democracies at their center against like a a totalitarian soviet uh opposition even though that soviet system is still subordinate to the global capitalist order and is just a part of it and is is not uh its own independent economic uh first mover the first mover is United States at this point uh, so by the mid-60s these uh contradictions start kicking in, so that's why this chapter is called contradictions of success, uh, so the US helps build up this robust manufacturing economy in Europe, starts trading with it, well what that means? is eventually the European manufacturing industry stood up on its own, is able to adapt all of America's uh uh efficiencies uh is able to get all the technological things that help like increase increase productivity and increase efficiency so maximize profit, they could they get all that stuff, america has a head start, but once uh but since the US is not advancing faster than uh the Europe is catching up pretty soon that's putting huge pressure on the dollar, dollar is getting sucked out of the country. you go from a situation where in the in the mid 50s there's barely any dollars in the European economy uh that's and that uh most of that ends up being uh marshall marshall plan money by the mid 60s it's reversed and there's this huge dollar glut in Europe and a lot of it is fueled by uh uh the fact that that uh private sector investment that direct foreign investment that the us uh private capital was is not sending to Europe right after the war, they were sending it to Latin America, uh, by the early 60s, it completely shifts. part of that is because of 1958 there's a recession in the United States and that capital starts going looking for better returns elsewhere, and they find them in this robust, growing uh, European manufacturing trade network, but all of this was uh putting huge pressure on the system of fixed exchange rates that define the Brenton Woods structure. saying like we're not going to like the way it is now you can go and every day there's a new uh exchange rate between different currencies like the lera just keeps going up you know uh and the us during the the boom period is able to impose this it's not the dollar uh it's basically a global uh gold standard because even though you know the US doesn't have the same relationship with gold. uh that it had like before FDR, there's still a gold peg to the dollar, which means they are able to impose a global uh global gold standard, which is what limits inflation, which is that you know... that that that uh inflation is the is the like the result of the friction of a class conflict within a society like given off within their economy like that is that is the uh that is the uh economic manifestation of class conflict within a society uh the more smooth the gears of social organ are like you know we're fighting a war or we're having a really cool booming post-war era where everything's fat and happy, and you know, the biggest conflict socially is about what do we do with these people who were not part of the human uh or the um American social structure, these people whose domination allowed capitalism to flourish, what are we going to do, now that they have the ability to assert themselves, because now they do have you know been turned into citizens in all but name and that they have been turned into capitalist subjects and that means that they are able to assert their own interests. and that creates this conflict, but within the like the the greater cukoon of you know American identity, the 50s uh are this era of of humming social concord, profits go up for businesses, that means or profits go up for corporations, that means uh benefits go up for uh workers, but in the 60s, oh my god, this conflict is now heating up because the complacent white are given birth to a bunch of fucking kids who aren't complacent, they don't take, they take for granted the conditions that that generation, the greatest generation took as a miracle, that that that uh that levit town house with the fucking quarter acre that the veterans of world war i got the white veterans of world war i got after uh getting out of the military was literally a social valhala, a realized immetized valhala. for the people who had suffered through the great depression of world war 2, like nobody who fought in World War II had not experienced the great depression, which meant that many of them had been had grown up in conditions of just apocalyptic poverty uh and and and similarly apocalyptic social crisis, and then they fought a fucking war, they went somewhere and they shot someone, they saw people shot. you get up, you come home and it's like no more violence, no more destabilization, now you can consume your way to heaven, now of course none of them would be able to, they'd all be miserable eventually, but at the time it is a incredibly persuasive offer, and it's a social lubricant. Europe needed way more because their society had been more deeply traumatized by the war than ours. but by the mid-60s this social concord is breaking down because the racial basis that it required is breaking down and this is happening socially the same time that those European and pretty soon now Japanese economies are manufacturing at a level uh equal to the United States pulling down the rate of profit that everything had depended on so that's where inflation starts kicking into the system, this is the smoke turning into flames, like a five a five, like inflation is always just like, it's it's this kindle right, because it's it's the inevitable and constant uh class conflict that defines society, but it's uh its expression can be like a low manageable level, or it can be? spikes of like significant social violence and and and this is very important at this point, not now anymore, but I mean increasingly uh, labor activity, fucking strikes, militant, militant uh unionism, because while this is happening, prophets are going down, oh what's this, they can't take it out of labor because everybody's got a union and nobody's going to sign off on - having their pay checks cut because they're still working for a living and they want to be compensated for it, and that is why the this the vision that I think people like Kanes and FDR had is that the eventually it would be unarguable to anyone who is rational, that the only way to bring about a stable social order, the thing that we all purport to want and the kind of social advancement that we all perport to want is to what do what Kane said and utthanize the rentier class right? surely uh eat the heart out of capitalism without having to go uh through with a c cataclysmic class war and of course like it was very persuasive when you're you know sitting in an office when you aren't a worker when every day is not alienated from you it's very easy to say this is the best possible option because it discounts the real daily alienation of being a worker and what that and how it compounds through your social life if imagine from a position of bourgeois complaicency, but again, you can't blame people everyone who's going to rise to a position within these systems is going to have that uh belief, if they didn't, they wouldn't be there, and that belief is self-motivated, but all of ours are. so this full employment economy uh that empowers workers, full employment creates inflation, and then the empowered workers deny the ability of capital to take that inflation out of the height of labor, which it has to do, or otherwise it takes it out of capital, because there's only two places for it to go, inflation enters the system to keep profit in under capitalism to keep profits up as a is a like uh a defense mechanism. of of the profit sector, because what i think guys like FDR and Kanes would have hoped is is that by the 70s, by the 60'ss and 70s by this point, the leaders of the advanced countries would have been so rational, so committed to uh reality that they would have recognized that the only way to deal with this crisis, this fundamental contradiction at the heart of global capitalism, is to effect a slow and steady climb down of capital, by something like the minener plan in Sweden, and of course, Sweden, like one of the most advanced of the social democracies, generates the closest thing to an actual policy that could have been an alternative to what we got in the 70s and that is this plan to by uh have by law a certain percentage of shares of all public stock to be held by the government uh or no, not the government, the labor union, sorry, the union would be guaranteed as part of their compensation uh, and you know their treaty with with capital, a a certain percentage of stock that would increase over years, so eventually they would have a majority stake and therefore administrative control of the means of production, this is this is the fantasy they had, and the closest we got was an articulation of it in the minor plan, also the British Labor Party, which was still very radical in the early 17. had as they saw this coming developed uh a alternative which we'll talk about about the next chap in the next chapter, but in the real heart of hearts in America where it mattered, there was nobody to be found who had that kind of vision, the closest thing you'd have is like a Nixon, but the problem with Nixon is is at the end of the day he was more than anything middle class, if you want to define Nixon's essential character, it is not even as an American, it is as a middle class. uh uh a middle class striver, that is what defined him, and so his ambitions were the ambitions of the middle class, so he could never have uh effectively allied or affected a uh working class lead uh march toward socialism, he would have smashed the thing up before that, and we saw even in the conditions that he did have where he was really battling only against capital. and not against slaver really, they've been neutralized, uh, he still got fucking owned, because like when Nixon really wanted to do was like step down, but on American terms, which is only ever going to lead, even if he wouldn't have thought so, only ever going to lead to fascism again, because you can't have a national capitalism. not at this stage of development, you cannot have a national capitalism under conditions of this much accumulated technological uh power, this much force multiplying of like human kinetic energy. in a nuclear age you cannot have national capitalism, certainly not at the scale of consumption that the United States requires, even if it was like in barracks. I mean you look at Nixon's upbringing, the son of a fucking bitter, a guy a failed farmer, somebody who had tried to grasp the yoman dream, had it taken from him and then forced to do the shadow version, the pathetic uh play version of yoman self-sufficiency, a business owner, like now ours our business owners they can only they associate you know their uh yoman autonomy only like through the lens. history, it's all, it's all just on their terms, but a guy like uh, Nixon's dad, uh, fuck, I forgot his first name, uh, somebody tell me his first name, uh, but a guy like Nixon's dad had had it and seen it go, seen it fall through his fingers, then he had, he owned a grocery store, that's like, okay, great, you know, he doesn't have a boss, but now he's fucking selling other people's food, he cannot, he's not making his own, he's not sustaining himself, france, Francis, he is dependent on the market, he is dependent on suppliers, he's he has a relationship with employees, he's on this knife edge at all times, and then Nixon grew up with that, and then he shows up as one of the bright boys at the exact moment, all the other best and brightest emerge right, the people, the generation who would cause the Vietnam war and then uh the neoliberal engine of death that we all live with, these guys uh they all had that moment right, go going to college uh getting turning into men just as world war i happens and he can't go to an iv league school, he has to go to his local college wittier, that's very funny because he is in many ways like a mirror image of Johnson and they are very in a lot of they are they're the two most interesting in my mind psychologically presidents we've had, they're two of the most uh erratic psychos we've ever had to be president, the fact that we survived them both being in charge of the nuclear button is honestly a miracle and they both came from backgrounds where their landowning father had lost it all and and uh then had to struggle for something else. "the difference is is that Francis Nixon's milliu was business and uh Johnson's was government because his dad had been a prominent member of the state senate, state legislature, and so there was a certain uh government becomes like this uh, this trusted institution from a young age, and a viable ladder of" of uh advancement, nixon comes to politics like because he's a megaliac, but from the outside having been alienated from it is all life, but anyway what this the gist of all of this is that the people in the rooms making these decisions now, capitalism has so fully determined every one of the the subsequent like uh rungs of control that they might be in charge of uh that there is no longer any jengo tile that they can pull without causing a huge rupture in the global capitalist political economy, because if you did exproperate capital to deal with this crisis, they would fight back everywhere. and the thing is is that even the labor party politicians who are in charge in the social democratic parties of Europe and even the euro communists, they fundamentally have a aligned class interest with capitalism to avoid a final rupture, and that is the problem, that's why really you have to have uh political organization, you have to build structures of power, it's in it's you cannot not do it, only way to have people organized sufficiently to address crisis and provoke moments of rupture, but at those grass, those grass roots have been killed, they had been killed by the the fucking uh the round up of post war uh post war uh imperial capital surplus. and the mass exporation and immiseration of the global south. you can't unring that bell in 1974, right? you can't say, hey, we're from the middle of the of capitalism and we uh, it's all not working. so we're gonna we're gonna get rid of it, hey no hard feelings you guys, right? no, there's now this in uh this this uh fundamental alienation between periphery and center at every level, this guilt and and resentment and and shame that can't be addressed uh and that and that social peace in the middle of the in the core is built on. I am looking at the chat when I look, yes, so uh, I've this has been a long, I'm still barely get into introduce. into this stupid chapter, but uh, okay, you have this inflation crisis begin in the mid 50s, at the exact peak of profits, you have this inflation start to kick in, and then profits start to collapse, and that drives uh this uh, this new crisis at the uh, that eventually manifests in the uh, the money. system, there aren't enough US dollars anymore to go around, if they keep printing more of them, inflation will increase, so they have to, once again, they don't have to do this, they could excorporate banks, they could nationalize, they just cannot realistically do it, so that means there has to be a restructuring of this thing, but how is it going to go, where is it going to come from, and and and uh Panditch say once again, it begins in the halls of American state power, where you first see uh this uh addressing the beginning of like an articulation of a new way forward that then gets pushed through the whole global system to break up that uh global new deal order and turn it into something liberalized. uh one of the first big things that does that is that uh what are the contributors to uh volatility in the global market is that uh ethnic uh is that economic nationalism in the former colonial world is that it's all-time high and that means excorporation of uh of foreign investment is at an all-time high and the World Bank emerges as an institution uh devoted to arbitrating at a allegedly like uh impersonal like uh disinteres it basically uh it introduces itself as a global court for disputes between states and uh private or foreign investors and of course this is a sham this is like international law and any other instance this is a thing weighted towards the interest of the foreign investors it's designed to help them it's designed only to pacify uh the... the given state if it's not powerful enough to assert its will, and this is the model uh that is going to be used to break up and destroy these little nodes of economic nationalism uh in the uh 80s and 90s, it's like uh when they use the the it's when they use the sound waves to break up kidney stones. they're going to use uh these informal institutions of of adjudication like the World Bank to impose new liberalized uh financial uh and capital markets on these countries. In the face of popular demands for nationalization. It's all about preventing actual democracy from ever ac from ever threatening the system. That's what this entire process is uh. part of this is keeping the damn brits happy, so the US allows through a loop-hole uh this back door uh uh in the bank of London which you know we have a special relationship with England given what happened to their economy uh after the war they honestly should have been completely destroyed uh but we kept them up because of the special relationship and because of the necessity of the old structures of uh global finance that the bank that the uh British had built, and part of that is the pound, the bloody pound sterling, which we kept along, limping along as as a strong currency, uh, it didn't get devalued like the leer or something, even though it probably should have um, and and another thing we gave them to help prop them up is this uh this clearing house for us dollars that was that uh circumvents the fixed exchange system called the euro dollar market uh and what this does is it allows American banks to avoid the regulations limiting interest rates that were imposed uh after the uh great crash 29 uh by put out and get and uh uh exchanging on this uh dollar uh in this dollar market and at the same time this makes uh us bonds very attractive so uh a ton of uh capital us capital floods into Europe commercial banks are offering uh security like cds, so you're no longer just having your money invested in some sort of thing, you're purchasing financial instruments, which is that's that's a new, that's that's bluring the lines that class steegel were supposed to build between finance institutions and commercial banks for regular people to put their money in, and that money is getting added at this point by pensions, because one of the things that uh these militant workers are able to ring out of capital is these huge pension contributions that then have to get put somewhere and they get invested into these markets too, so workers are getting uh becoming part of uh the capital uh market and benefiting from it. this is the kind of stuff, these are the jenga pieces that can't be pulled away once the crisis gets deeper, because you have these institutions that are uh uh that are disconnected fundamentally from uh from militancy like because that militancy has been diffused and redirected and and uh abstracted and alienated by all of the uh realities of society in a context of uh class conflict being sublimated into consumption that increases the importance of culture. It it makes culture bigger and more powerful and a bigger uh factor in sustaining capitalism than it had been before, because one of the key things keeping people from acting like workers is that they have so much of their time invested in these pursuits of identity formation that are outside of their uh their conditions as workers, but are in fact instead defined as their positions as consumers. a consumer-based economy means people are going to consume more, they're going to spend more of their time consuming and is going to do more to fill to shape their conscious sense of self than the hours they spend working on, and when that so that means that when the crisis happens, people are, they're trusting of their labor union, they're trusting of the... vote, maybe they're losing that trust, but not enough to do anything effectively, because those social bonds that would have allowed them to do something else, they are gone. there is a big strike wave during this period, there's a big mass in the early 70s rather, as this is getting worse, there's a huge strike wave in the United States uh, that rivals in numbers the strike wave of the late 40s after world war 2, but this is like a rear guard action, this is like the... the dying flash of like the remaining class solidarity that existed among workers who uh as I said didn't take for granted uh consumption and exchange for exploitation because they didn't live through world war 1 and World War II and the great depression they took for granted that level of that social conflict compact they wanted to push beyond it everyone wants to push beyond every human wants to push beyond it's it's absurd not to want to what the capital. had given them as 20 years where they got to push around and now a time when crisis had emerged and we could no longer sustain the fantasy of reform, the revolutionary impulse has been cotally uh diffused culturally, culturally defused, not diffused, defused, part of this by. way is a generation of regulators and bankers who fill these institutions who are not wetted to uh the kensian deal and and the the administrative state, they don't feel like they don't imagine it as they don't have... the relationship of like this is the life raft that saved humanity, like we were going to be swallowed by darkness, the globe was going to be a charnel house, and this thing, this this structure, this American capitalist uh uh cansian state saved us, so they had a had a real like existential loyalty to it that younger people at every level like the young rebels who actually did want to fight the state but had no class vocabulary to organize their... disconent and therefore saw it defused, so this strike wave is part of that, but it's w it's and it's largely wild cat strikes in opposition to complacent management that was willing to sign the death treaty, the death certificate of the working class in America because it meant they get to stay in a union office instead of on the line, it comes down to that, I believe. They take for granted at every level, the labor union organizers, the the politicians at every level at this point, that their personal interest and the best interest of all are identical, and you can't disabbe some of that because it is, it is a motivated reasoning that goes beyond rationality, which is why we never got the FDR uh and fantasy of the this being the moment when okay, capital, give it up, because if capital gives it up, then the imperial core has to give it up, again, not all at once, and not catastrophically, because the whole idea is you you, you adjust as things change, you build as the the ground shifts, you don't force anything, but in a way that takes tells people who have los their class solidarity, lost their understanding of themselves as any kind of international project to give up control of their lives, uh, the prospect of like continued material uh advancement, but doesn't give up, but doesn't uh immediately alleviate alienation and exploitation either, that's a tall order, and the thing is that it was so thoroughly tall that by the time the moment came there was almost nobody there to really articulate it, the alternative never materialized, all we got was this internal reform towards uh terminal capitalism, like this is late capitalism in the sense that it is locking in a political economy that is in self-conscious conflict, like the people building it, no, the capital can just let her rip and that is every one of these guys will know going to destabilize all of the structures that had sustained it until this point uh but the reason they do it more than anything is because they don't believe that there is an alternative because in their mind there isn't that area has been foreclosed the alternative is a apocalypse because they cannot conceive of a utopia that's what's that's a part of their brain that's been saudered off by their exposure, their day-to-day exposure as a like prime mover in the capitalist uh orgon that there is that this is the only world that it can be, that we are not enforcing a uh a democratic coordination of resources, we are enforcing a... transcendent law, I think that's what it boils down to, these people had emerged by this point, convinced a atomic level to the point that the only thing that was ever going to beat them was a revolutionary confrontation with people did not have that programming, which we didn't get, and you might say, well that's good, because that would have been a nuclear war, and it's like, yeah, you could argue that as soon as the atomic bomb is developed, that the class war is over, and it's just like you can say skynet went self-aware at the trinity test. because there can be no real confrontation between capital and labor of the of the size sufficient to reorientate this machine away from inevitable extinction that will not trigger an instantaneous extinction, the activation of the death drive that lies dormand in the heart of capitalism under any conditions and then uh goes into overdrive in uh terminal conditions like the fascist states of uh of mid of the 30s in Europe and Japan. So first, LBJ tries to deal with this inflationary crisis by imposing limits on capital outflows in 1968 uh, and then even and Nixon gets elected, he doesn't change that, he keeps that in force showing his that he's. as he said we're all cainsians now uh and then in 1971 they close the gold window they say the US dollar is no longer convertible to gold and that means no more fixed exchange rates now and ever since uh the exchange rate floats you go to the board and there's a different uh you're going to get a different number depending on how their markets are doing depending on how much capital is flowing into versus out of their economies uh and this is widely destabilizing, obviously uh, but it allows the United States to keep foreign capital coming in, which it needs to, for to uh activate one end of the global uh uh supply circuit, well also exporting capital, which it still has to do, so the only way to do that is to unpeg the gold standard and basically print more money, going to have to do it. uh, but that means that to stop that inflation we were talking about, without gold there, the US dollar is going to have to be kept below a certain level of inflation, more most importantly, inflation on the dollar has to stay lower than other countries that we're trading, they're allowed to flow to higher uh uh inflation, can't because we are the we're the the stone weighing the whole thing down like and that that's imposed by that's an artificial imposition like that's what i'm saying these people think that that is god they're serving they think that that like that that vestidual relationship between value and like a natural object is their residual belief in the transcendential nature of capitalism. transcendental nature of capitalism, because you want to know why the cold war didn't end in a nuclear war, because the soviets would never have done it, we would have done it, the soviets would never have started a nuclear war, when you read about how Krushchev was uh reacted. to the news that the the com that the the USSR had tested their first nuke successfully, he was, he was, he got drunk for like a week, I believe is what happened, like he was horrified by the the prospect of that sort of global uh apocalypse, just wiping out the entire project of human you, civilization, uh, and that's why when Soviet system came into terminal crisis, did they launch the nuks? no, but if this system goes into a similar crisis, will will there be a launching of nuks? absolutely, and so the question becomes, and it's going to only be answered by the end of the 70s by the vulker uh interest rate hike at the fed, "the US is going to break labor to make this happen, and that's the project, that's the federal government's project of this during this crisis period, starting specifically in the 70s, uh, is to break labor domestically and abroad through all of its uh levers of power over you know military uh espionage and and deep state uh intelligence structures uh uh politics uh" and uh monetary and fiscal policy, so that's that's what's happening here is that this the 70s is a long buck breaking and these chapters talk about the the buck breaking of the uh the inter national left uh and then the next one will be about the the final buckbreaking of the American uh left and i mean broadly electoral left which you know your combination of uh of students and uh radicals and uh but also the the low the closest thing to a social democratic party that exists uh and the organs of the trade unions of the working. class, so um, okay, so that's chapter five, so this is what's happening, how are we going to buck break the left, uh, the working class, uh, and chapter six, structural power through crisis, shows how uh, this is starting to come into focus, so we got the situation here where uh, the contradictions of managing an a inherently in and immovably in inegalitarian social order are uh just multiplying the third world they're excorporating profit, this is the important part, this is the thing, profit on manufacturing in the United States declines 40% from 1965 to 70, this is after it had just been going up up up and then had just a supernova. in the mid 60s to just collapse pretty much overnight uh and this is this starts all the bells and whistles this starts the whole machine to start to shutter in every institution uh in every level of the political economy uh now companies respond by uh investing like that's what you're supposed to do oh we're not making this much money well we need to be more productive so how do you be more productive you invest in ways to increase efficiency, and they did the thing, but the product, the uh, the investment did not produce a rise in uh productivity that could reverse this trend, and one of the things that stood in the way, this is one of these contradictions, these fundamental contradictions, it's in the best interest of the workers for the profits to rise, right, because then they get more of the profits, but in the face in a situation of declining profits, a company is going to try to increase productive. by increasing efficiency, but increasing efficiency increases alienation and exploitation of workers, which have been set a certain tolerable level under certain conditions of consumption. now those conditions of consumption, thanks to inflation are being destabilized, and now the companies are asking them to self-exploit, and they because they have militancy, because they have strong unions, resist part of this wave of wildcats you got. and also the other thing you can do if you want to reclaim profits, if you can't get more efficiency is you reclaim it from labor, but that also is prevented by the unions, so the the companies are basically stuck now in this situation, and it's often blamed on the workers right, like that's the right-wing argument about this is, it was the greedy workers who led to this, it's like no, the workers were just doing what they were uh, was in their best interest, their self-interest uh, in any way that you can express it, they were looking after their position within the company in the their relationship to capital, it was labor union movement was doing what it was supposed to, it just wasn't it wasn't doing it uh with sufficient militancy to uh maybe win a confrontation, instead it negotiated its way to anniholation. so you start to see bank failures now uh and and big companies start going under there. this uh Penn central corporation, well sixth biggest company in America, it fucking uh collapses, the US uh Nixon tries to back it out back to bail it out and uh Congress says no dice because that would be interfering in the economy uh and this is when the Fed in the face of this inflation instead of cutting rates or instead of increasing rates cuts them and a lot of people blame uh FDR or blame Nixon for doing this to try to get reelected cynically in 1972 but it was really about pumping liquidity into the economy. to prevent that collapse from triggering a general uh uh crisis, so this is when the fed starts its policy of injecting liquidity to uh prevent a domino of uh bankrupties, and this is becomes their remit, this is what they do for the rest of uh until now, like that's been their only button to press, that is why we were having such an interesting crisis now, because you know by that token on the interest rate thing, but if they do it too hard, they really do risk triggering something that they have no other response to, a terminal. crisis and they don't want that either, so that's why it just seems like nobody has any idea what the fuck to do, and this there was a similar feeling during this period, because nobody could conceive of doing what ended up happening to the working class of this country, but what they didn't realize is how it would happen, how the the pain would be disproportionately felt by people who lived uh in urban areas, people who did not access the home owning bananza of the post war world, who did not get a cut chuck of equity and therefore interest in capitalism and in markets who got no uh equity in the American project basically uh they were not stockholders that of course disproportionately racial minorities which means their pain is filtered only you know kind of peripherally into the political structure uh political body is happy to kind of sacrifice these people which they did to the war on drugs. and that meant that and then you've got within you know the the the the white racial category you still have uh you might have people who are you know uh all home owners but some of them are going to be members of uh professions that are going to keep expanding in uh income and stuff and others are going to totally stultify and then over time they're going to be owned by it, but they're going to be owned by themselves, they're going to be owned in isolation, they're not going to feel it as as the state, as the capitalist order uh dominating them, that's going to feel like a collection of small personal failures, because that's how only way that they have been told to understand their lives, they are not a part of anything, they are an individual and they are rising and falling. their own responsibility and so this stuff that like taken as one hammer blow is inconceivable becomes over time possible as these reforms just sink into the system and allow each crisis to more disproportionately uh send its greatest misery to its most disempowered portions. and of course like yeah inflation is bad, but it's made much worse by the fact that it's the only way to talk about uh the economy like in a grand structural sense and it's inherently invested with a reactionary framework because remember this is this the the the inflation of money right, this is the real fire of class conflict, this is the the the friction. turning into flame, and we can only see from the the shadow in plato's cave the words inflation, as there as though there is a economy that is separate from our will, which is the grand mystification of capitalism and the reason it can never be reformed from within. but the real way that they try to get Nixon reelected is to dump a ton of money into the mortgage system, so they there's this crisis of uh of of of wages, they can't really give any more money to workers directly, but they can get more of them into houses, ones who were missed by the first, the last waves of uh of of home ownership, but of course they can't just be directly given the way that gi uh bill had given like college educations and uh and government mortgages uh they had to put it out into this new bursioning finance uh capital market fanny may starts selling mortgage back securities this is where mortgage back securities begin and it is a way to dumpling quidity at the bottom of the us uh consumer pyramid near the bottom anyway nearer to the bottom than before to get some more consumption into the goddamn thing and this begins the the paradigm we're stuck with now which is liquidity being pumped in uh only now it only gets pumped in at the top we've even lost post 2008 uh the ability to pump in at the bottom at all the closest thing we had were the uh were the very meely uh uh stimulus checks of the late Trump and Biden Early Biden years which did you know uh help salvage things but also contributed in some way to this new new normal of inflation. which i really think is best understood as just this expression of a of a class system that is screaming under pressure, but of course we can't talk about it in those terms, we have to talk about it in terms of this, this this god that has to be appeased with sacrifice, which is this is that is the religion that we're being fed, this is a meso-american fucking noble class structure basically being imposed on it. people are going to have to be sacrificed literally uh to the god of inflation because it is immoral to expropriate from capital, because unlike every other part of life, every other human relationship, the relationship between owner of capital and his capital, a totally ficticious arrangement, sends all human values. now part of the reason that we're stuck with this is because one, there was one last trick that the kensians could pull here, there was one last canesian button to press, and in 1971 nixon pressed it, which were wage and price controls. this is it, just the government saying, you're not getting any more money, but things aren't going to cost anymore, because one of the big things driving increased uh pay packets for workers is that they had to keep ahead of inflation, but of course that helped drive inflation. I know that the MMTers are screaming, no, no, no, that didn't do anything. I get it, you're talking about what is in some metaphysical fucking world, yes we hypothetically could do anything with anything, but as I was saying, by this point we have reifified institutions that hold real power, and they cannot just be assumed away magic. so your analysis is essentially beside the point. the very same thing is true of georgism with the single tax. yeah, you're right, but who cares? the rightness of it will not make it win. that was the dream of fucking FDR and fucking canes and all these liberals and it's the last dream of the socialist liberal, which is a pure strain breed of like American uh goodie goody. God bless them, they're they're in in many cases they're allies of the working class, hell, I probably count as one in some respect, but at the end of the day they want to come, they want to avoid the class conflict, because it seems to them more traumatic than the status quo, which is of course, that's that's the lie, right, is that the pain and misery and horror of this system is somehow acceptable, that this is okay, because it is, regrettable, sad, should, we should do something about it, but as a baseline, it's something that we can live with, and we do, we literally do, and one of the reasons we do is because everybody else does, and we can't really do anything about that, but what we can do is not pretend like, our uh politics should reflect that like even just the way we frame things i don't know again like i get wanting to like try to clear people's minds of of the mystifications but if you accept that this sus this system could be democratically administered which is what mmt presupposes. and you are assuming a uh fundamentally contradictory being, you you are summoning a um an oximoron into being, and at first business actually welcome. raising price controls uh labor dust too, although they start pointing out, hey you know those uh those wages they're they're getting clamped on a lot a lot harder by the regulators than those prices are uh and of course that was true uh but eventually it just became too unwildly as as the need to speed things up increased they had to jack more into this they had to keep the circulation uh speeding up to to compensate for the general uh the stall they had to start. the necessary organs that keep capitalism going, so we got a floating exchange right here, embraced by Washington, but they had to pitch it to the rest of the world, people were terrified of getting off gold, because these are all capitalists, they all want to maintain capitalism and they're all terrified of losing that uh organizing principle of the global comedy, that that regulator, and uh part of the part of the job of pitching it is telling them like this is going to come with greater freedom of your financial markets uh and that becomes the the the carrot that gets them to go along with it uh meanwhile this is like restructuring all of the global markets and it's also doing so well reinforcing us power because now it's it's just straight our currency uh that is going to be determining uh like these global trends and techn, the tech sector uh is a big part of that, like US has a huge uh leaps forward in computer technology in the 70s, and the reason it's the United States is because the US built a military, industrial state after the war, they didn't spend their money on fucking social housing and making sure people had 30-day work weeks, they spent it on a military industrial machine that spent a incredible amount of... on pure research that had huge that would could not have been produced in the private sector because of the need to make money in the immediate uh future and that meant that you had these huge government funded innovations that occurred in the 70s once again this is all stuff that could have been taken by a socialist governing structure and put to the job of networking the global economy and getting rid of... the need for the private sector, getting rid of the need for the the capitalist class to organize the social order, getting get away for the need for class exploitation, and this is the kind of thing that Chile was was experimenting with with Cyberson, of course we made sure that Pinachees guys, goons went in there, machine gun the whole thing. In the US we made these huge advancements, but they were put to private use, they were put to the use of bulstering the the the uh the private economy uh there's an interesting part in this chapter where uh Bill Casey who uh conspiracy heads might recognize as uh Regan's CIA chief the guy who did all who created like a completely unaccounttable uh shadow government that did Iran Contra and the October Surprise basically reacted to the church committee uh and Watergate by just building a secondary uh layer of uh distance from accountability from like the real arm of state policy uh in this period he is an undersecretary of state and he writes about how to people who are skittish about this new reality that is going to mean you know uh this new reality that's oh we're opening up the global economy we're putting the us we're going to float the dollar at the same time that our manufacturing profits are fucking just skitting down a hill uh casey writes it's going to be okay this is going to strengthen America because America uh it doesn't have to export uh goods anymore it can export securities we can take this huge uh uh finance uh this huge capital um market in the US and throughout every level of it securitize it by getting rid of those new deal era regulations that prevent that kind of... speculative work, and this is this is literally speeding up the economy to make up for its longitudinal decline. we're going okay, we can't circulate at the level of products, we can circulate at the level of these ficticious derivatives that are referring to value in the future, and this means that these sec gets uh buck broken and turned uh, it's ability to actually oversee uh you know any real uh with any... and with any real uh you know power that's gone uh and uh banks start sending out cds so they're turning into uh they're securitizing we got these mortgage back securities i just talked about we have this new uh thing we can sell a new way to circulate the currency and of course it's not based on real value it's raised on speculative value. we're we're we are multiplying, we're creating multipliers for a real economy that is no longer profitable and the long term. now that should tell you you have to readjust things, maybe. get rid of profit, maybe socially determined, so that you're going to have conflict, you're going to have violence, you're going to have probably state-by-state warfare, but you're going to have a general trend towards uh an equilibrium being reached uh where you get rid of the the downward spiral of capitalist cyclical crisis, but as I said, there's nobody there to argue for that, so instead what we get is this newly securitized economy. uh that can that makes value out of thin air uh and in the mid-70s you see bank collapses, there's a San Diego bank that collapses, there's a big German bank that collapses, and this is when the government starts stepping in without really anybody knowing it, certainly not with any deliberation uh in in public and starts uh stepping into backstop these collapses and this is the real uh pact of neoliberalism, the only only half of this gets told, you get told that oh yeah, the 70s was this neoliberalization period period when all these regulatory structures were relieved and the government's hand in the market was reduced and that's half the story, but the other side is that at the very same time because of the way that the the central banks respond to these bank collapses, you're seeing a pattern established where uh this new order that is going to be less publicly regulated is going to be subject to more uh frequent and more responsive state intervention in the form of bailouts, in the form of liquidity. so the only way to sustain this newly volatile speculative economy is to guarantee that none of the crisis that prov are provoked by it turminally cascade through the system. it's a fail safe, but it is government intervention, so the... government is still there, which is why most of the discussions of neoliberalism that sort of make it about making the state invisible, are telling only the public facing story, the story that these guys tell themselves, in reality it is just refiguring the state to be less democratically accountable, it is getting rid of any actual public influence on what this state, which is capital and this uh and the the government is going to do. and the real showcase for this new regime that is going to redefine the the uh the political economy of every country along these new lines is in Britain which is the first European country to get the uh the ned Baity network treatment which is totally makes sense because no country in Europe. had a more delusional relationship with its own uh economy than the UK did, and that's for very good reasons, like I said, they were our our older uncle, they were, that's that's our uncle, that's our and the uncle magic between the US and Britain is unchallenged in the world, even though we fought early on, we took over their global uh economic order, we have an inner mesh ruling class. so that means that we're not going to let them turn into uh like fucking Greece after World War II, we're not going to let them languish, and of course because they're a superindustrialized state, their working class won't let them languish, the working class would have organized politically to prevent that, because they were, this is the first working class in the world, yes they've been pacified by you know Britain's imperial plunder and it's the legends that tells itself, but the... still had much, a lot of capacity in the 50s or uh, and so the sterling got booyed by the US, uh, they got to have their overvalued currency and pretend to be one of the big boy economies, uh, now they had to go, and even then they had to do austerity in the 50s, but then they got to go along, they got to get the tail, tail end of uh of the 60s boom, but by the early 70s it's already falling apart, because as soon as the US can no longer hold that center with the gold standard, the whole and you get that floating exchange rate, sterling is doomed, because the economy cannot, the economy is not productive enough to pay in the capitalist sense to pay for the level of social social expenditure that they had settled on after the war, can't do it. so now you have a a labor government which had a meiden plan ask radical plan, it's that it's delegates supported initiated to take control of the banking sector, to to do it, to do the thing that the fucking uh, that the labor parties of Europe had always implicitly promised to do at the day of at the on the day of judgment, okay, we're here, this is it, it's us or them, we're going to take control of this thing, and that's how they got elected, but then call again, he gets his net baby speech, and the US leans on him hard and the mechanism they used to do it is an if an IMF loan. now this is going to be how they but break the rest of the world and it starts in Britain. the IMF, this this instrument of US capital offers a loan to deal with the massive uh currency crisis occurring in Britain because of their balance of trade because of their deficit. they will offer them a sweetheart loan that gets them off the hook economic. in exchange for austerity, in exchange for changing the social contract between the British public and their government, and that labor government, they fought a little bit, their delegates pitch to fit, but at the end of the day they took the deal, because to them the alternative, and this is it, they honestly believe the alternative was an economic collapse that would have... destroyed Britain because they could not imagine that kind of crisis resulting in uh the working class taking power, they couldn't imagine it, it was outside of their minds, that lob that utopian lobe had been spot welded shut by the experience of being a labor politician and by by being uh top labor union guys, and this is it's a and then they get another fucking uh show of affirmation in in the referendum and then the Germans don't blink and then they have they have to shut up pitch up they have to they have to shut up shop they have to just pitch the tents they have to piss on the fire and call in the dogs in the face of what the people telling them to do, because they did not have it, they didn't have a plan, verificus claims he had a plan, but none of them had the will to carry it out because they were too scared of rupture, they were too frightened of apocalypse, but the fact is is that if if you are a utopian, which all socialist should be, because it is the social consummation of the christian u teleos, then you should... to say that we something can come out of this that because I'm not saying oh this would have been like a nuclear war some pedimo bullshit or I'm sorry passadist bullshit or like oh yeah this would have been epic red terror in the streets and they all would have been like living in a miserable uh mowist or no they would have like basically been it would have been turning uh Britain into uh the Kamir Roge Cambodia but that's okay buse it's based and they killed all those pedophile uh ruling class scumbags it's based. not saying that, the conflict would not necessarily have been totally uh uh destructive, but it's sure is shit, would not have allowed guys like James Callahan to be fucking prime minister of Britain, it wouldn't allowed him to tool around fucking Downing Street in his little car or any of the people in in throughout the bureaucratic and political structures of the British state, no matter what party they were alleged to serve. they wouldn't be able to stay there, yeah, like i i always think that with ver facus like he had an idea, but that's all it was and it's like you needed to have way more planning and a way more of a network and way more institutional uh buying in to make that happen, and you really do have to say that like if that was the case then there should have been some attempt by somebody to tie the... referendum to a specific course of action, not just know and then see what happens, because what she was doing was again how this is a mirror of the first time this happens in in the 70s with the British, caalahan got this IMF deal and it's a horrible deal, they were they turned white at the prospect of this, they were horrified because they had this like remit to you keep doing uh parliamentary socialism, they their people, they won a majority with the promise to fucking do the do, so they went to their. uh uh so they went to the party and they said okay what do you guys think and they said no we have this alternative this benite socialist program where we're going to literally just take over these banking institutions and then callahan just went back to the US with that and said look this is what these guys want this is crazy, look at these guys, and this is they were hoping they could get a better deal, they were hoping they could get better terms, but what they didn't realize is that this was the condition, like this was this relationship had to be established, this new reality had to be established, there's no cutting the corners on this, this is an existential question, same thing for the Germans, the Germans getting paid back, was existentially necessary, so it's like they were willing, and the reason they were willing to hold the line there in both cases is because they knew that the they could not have the that the bluff could not be called, because what's Jim Callahan going to do, call a general strike? would the thoroughly bourgeoified working class of Britain have done a general? on Jame Callahan's command, maybe, but if he had and it had worked, they probably they would have killed him pretty much immediately, and maybe that leads to a shooting war, and maybe that leads to a cuba style situation where the fucking queen is forced to flee to Canada on a fucking like uh, in like the last flight out of uh out of the buckingham palace, but he doesn't survive that probably. not anybody that high profile, so in both cases and what and what was Shariza going to do? they didn't even they call bring back the dragma and then what? and so in both cases they just called the called the bluff, and so this labor government started the program that Thatcher finished and Thatcher was able to... say truthfully when she took office that she was not doing anything radical, she was completing the labor project, or maybe you get, here's the other thing, and here's the thing that callahan was probably thinking of, if anybody's ever read a very british coup or seeing the show, uh, the movie, he was probably thinking of... Chile or Indonesia before that, he's singing it like a a caravan of death of like the queen zone Westminster guards. Capitalism by the 70s had had the upper hand and everybody at every level had to come to that question of do I existentially confront the state and my own position relative to it or do I go along and plenty of people said no, I won't go along, but they tended to be at the bottom of the power distribution and at the top of the alienation and misery distribution, which meant that their resistance could and was neutralized, i mean like whatever verificacus was planning, there's no way that the us is going to go along. with it, that's for sure, we had Germany's back that whole time, somebody asked did the business plot win, and you know just you think about like the most radical class warriors in America in the 30s, you got you know your communist party USA, they're like the people who just could not accept. this uh condition, the reality of class war in America, as it played out in the public sphere in the 30s, they couldn't accept it, the business plotters couldn't couldn't, they could not, they could not, it didn't matter, oh it's for capitalism's best interest, shut up, i can't, my skin burns, it's i it was a religious violation, they felt it that way, it was talking about, like these are the most true believers, people really believe as opposed to having their belief levened by self-interest, like everybody is a combination of self-interest, like material self-interest and then their self-conception, but for guys like this at either end, their self-conception so depended on their like belief that they were willing to uh see the whole thing collapse, they were willing to see like in the street class war happen uh even if it sacrificed their lives, but there weren't that many of them, most people throughout the political spectrum. were to one way or another convinced to wait, wait and see, there's going to be something that's going to happen, and I know you're saying, well that's what you're telling us to do, it's like, yeah, but this is a different time, we we're at the spent end of this, and they both waited, and then first we have the big conflict, spoil up of world war 2, and this one, this this obviates everything, okay, everybody's interest is in sup'. this like explosion in the global capitalist machinery like uh these guys are are these are some bad uh gaskets that got to be removed one way or the other uh because you know if they win it's it's it's all over civilization the idea the dream of it is simple is over uh including the wealth of American uh capital um and then the big the conflict comes and in the late 40s, that's that's that's what everyone was waiting for, and uh, the not fault, through contingencies of history, the way events played out, the spontaneous stuff, the stuff that might be fully determined, but which we can't know as it's happening, and therefore can't assign blame for, leave it so that when that moment comes, the power, the organization, the capacity. is disproportionately aligned with capital, which means that by the time we get to this point in in in capitalism's development, the 60s 70s crisis point, this terminal trajectory, It's it's a totally one-sided affair. All right, so next week, I'll probably do a chill out stream on Wednesday, but no uh, no book, because I'm going to be out of town on starting Thursday, but next friday, Friday after that we'll do the next part, which I believe is part four. Right, let me check, part four, which is called, yes, the realization of global capitalism, so this is when we get to the real thing, when when the American working class is relationship to the state is fundamentally ruptured and changed, uh, throughout the reforms in the 70s, and then how that then ripples out, I think we'll probably be talking. some volker, volker has already made appearance as like a grubby little, he wasn't little, he was huge uh entity moving through all this stuff, he's a real zelig like figure for this whole period uh, and then that's all going to culminate uh with his given the economy the shocker uh in the late 70s, so we'll be talking about that uh two weeks, bye. was this gizmo?
