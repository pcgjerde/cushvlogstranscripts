 Oh, this broadcast is intended for, I don't think mature viewers, I don't know if that's true, I don't know if I would say that we're mature on here, I'm indoors because it's uh annoyingly call rainy out today, all over the place, can't go back to the bunker, even though it's still unseasonably warm, have not yet been able to set foot outside, it's quite dismal day indeed, oh god damn it, are people asking about mic volume, i'm going to hold on one second, i'm going to hold on one second, let me hear it again, i'm gonna hold on one second, let me hear it again. I literally am listening to it on Twitch and it sounds fine, I just listen to it coming through my own speakers, at a certain point I'm just going to have to privilege my own perception over whatever the robots and potential agence provocateur in this goddamn uh streamer telling me to do, I got to say that that the fact that it sounds crystal clear. coming out of the fucking Twitch channel as I'm watching it makes me wonder if you people aren't fucking with me you uh are uh in possession of very shitty fucking audio equipment and as Robert Downey Senior said in uh booggy Knights that is a yt that's not an mp. How's everybody doing tonight? I don't really have anything. I'm uh, I'm kind of cashed out, actually. might not do one tomorrow if it feels if I'm not getting if I not if I don't get a little prision, but that's often happened. I've come on the stream having no idea what to talk about and end up being like, holy shit, where that come from, so we'll see, we're going to take the journey together. Uh, congratulations by the way to president Trump for four more years, the uh... the electoral college has voted and uh he has enough electoral votes when uh go when vice president Pennce presides over the certification that uh he will be president uh several several very well-known and and and trustworthy websites uh and twitter accounts have said this and I have no reason to disbelieve it so man if they did that. "it would be the funniest thing in the world, I mean, and the funniest thing about it would be that all of the liberals right now, including myself, broadly defined, who are smuggly watching this flailing like pathetic non-coo happen, if they just said, oh uh, yeah, we're uh, we're we're not going to certify these votes, we're going to vo give it to Trump, and even though it violates the constitution and the letter and spirit of all law, nobody stops them." none of the people uh would be shocked by it would be able to do anything about it, like that's the truth of it, and I think that's why they feel so insistent on making you be mad, there's they know they realize that oh, like their chess, they imagine themselves part of a grand chess game of American progressivism, stretching back to, I don't know, uh, Wilson, something like that. where they are battling like the beheemeth uh of America's beastial uh like populist heart that you know they used to think was just dumb uh but now think is racist uh because like the changing uh intellectual composition of of of uh liberals and elite liberals who populate elite liberal institutions they've been in a chess game with reaction since world since since the progressive movement began. and they have found themselves and I think they realize that after this election and they realize that after watching all the norms just get blown away by Trump and now a situation where. they all realize oh our our formal uh uh barriers against just a pure reactionary grasp for power are non-existent, they do not exist, well that means you lost the game, that means you have been checkmated, you cannot do any move other than slit your own throat if you're if you consider yourself pr part of the... liberal project broadly construed and all these people do, like the way they talk about politics even if they're just regular people, they talk about the democratic party like they're part of it, like the way democrats, voters, not even people at like the media level talk about the democratic party as as if they're part of a project, which is of course not the case, they're along for the ride, to one degree or another, they're along for the ride, so they've lost, they've lost because they know in their heart. "Oh, if we ever did try to get the kind of change that I keep insisting, I want to see happen, the kind of change on something like climate change, or even some more emotionally, like uh, emotionally uh, you know, uh, compelling uh, uh, issue like racism or gun control, we're not going to get there without them just taking power, because we now know they could if they wanted to, you lost and because you're liberal, you have discounted anything other than politics as you understand it, to be the the way that we can you know battle reaction, the the dark heart of America's you know white maleness, you have discounted activism of any meaningful sign, you've discounted the labor movement as just another interest group, that's what the that's what the new left in the 60's and and the... emergent like Atari democrats agreed on, which was the consensus left position in in amongst this new like post 60s uh collegiate liberal and left millieu uh was that the unions are just another interest group if not an upholder of racism and patriarchy and they've stuck they've stood fast with that 40 years later and now they have no interest in in us labor is a mobilizing tool against reaction, they have no interest in doing anything other than voting for democrats, but they know now in their hearts the voting for democrats will never get them, so what they want now is they want to do the only thing that they think can work, and that is because they are media creatures one way or another, and they've decided in their hearts that that activism consists of yelling at people until they do what you told them to do, that all they can do is insist as loudly as possible. that this is something you should care about so that will just transsubstantiate people into like transsubstantiate regular democrats into donors and you know uh uh on the fence like liberals into committed democrats and and people who don't vote but are part of a oppressed minority that should instinctively vote for democrats will be snapped into consciousness. they will be face shifted into a consciousness as like a self-conscious democratic voter and then they will win because they'll just it'll be they'll they will have too many votes there will be too many places to steal it from and they'll have to give power and the only way that can come about is by yelling by getting people the by by presenting yourself emotionally now that's one part of it there's another more important part for anybody who's at the top of this medio totem pole or rather even in the middle if you're getting from the the political media as we understand it, your calculus is different, it's more self-consciously self-interested and less like psychological coping mechanism, here at that level, you can't just say, write an article or do a tweet or do a appearance on television and say uh, this fake cou, this the the continuance of this of the republicans to go along with all of these things up to including you know the texas lawsuit. and over 100 house republicans signing on to it, uh, that means that they will not accept another election that they lose if it's anything, if it's any closer than this, you anyone can say that, that doesn't, that doesn't position you uh, that doesn't make you stand out, it doesn't provide value add as a part of the media hierarchy, even if you're just trying to be a commentator from the bottom up, what? uh what provides value add is the follow-up, which is, and I can't believe we're track, we're not acting like this is a big deal, that is the move where you distinguish yourself. where you take something that's banal and you say, i am different from those others because i care about it more. people act like bob bar resigning as a big deal, he'd be gone in the middle of January anyway, what the what? oh yeah, on the other side of the deluted fence, apparently the chinese army. was just uh attacked uh with a with an air bombardment while trying to invade Maine from Canada, so everybody's living in their own fantasy world, us too, and uh, it's all about which one is is is is more pleasing to you, I think this is a pretty good one, I feel like the vibe here is better, I feel like this that it's less ans anxious. That's the thing I noticed on all spectrums of people trying to pretend that their political participation means something, the thing that unites them is the anxiety, anxiety about and I felt this anxiety for a long time, especially as we got closer to like the the uh to the inflection point of the of the Bernie campaign in 2020 early, good god, still this year, uh, was, oh god, like, am I wrong, what if I'm wrong, and that's bad, you don't want to be wrong for a bunch of reasons. but you also want to make sure that people think that there's a reason it matters if you're right or wrong and the thing that makes it matter is supposed to be you listen to this and then you do something or you act a certain way or you think a thing that makes you behave a way and if you need to sustain that I think it it takes an emotional toll and it was one that I couldn't handle anymore and that's why I kind of had to I was forced to reassess and break. my relationship from this uh this machinery and also there's the idea that you know look at me, i care more about this cou, and also uh that means that if you cared more then we would stop it, and it's going to be institutional. uh resistance that changes the calculus of capital or the republican party within it, it's not going to be, it's not going to be us participating at the level of electoral ritual, which is where we're happy, where we're comfortable, it's not going to do it, they will cancel an election if it's close enough or if they feel like the risk of losing power is greater. enough like real power, like the republicans willing to cut bait on Trump to the uh to the exact degree that they don't get is their base voters mad at that's the calculus, I have total interest in seeing Trump lose at this, get out of here at this point, I have nothing to gain, we have nothing to gain as a party by him clinging to power or trying to uh resist a peaceful transition, but we have these voters who love him and we can't fucking tell them the truth. because they don't think there's a project beyond Trump, because they're dumb pigs and the one thing that distinguishes us from them is that the highest level, although this is less and less true even within the ranks of government, because you know, i think something like two-thirds of republicans uh have either lost election primary or retired since Trump won, like they turned over almost the entire congress and that shirt change was to put true believers there or people either people who were cynically close enough to the... grassroots to just mirror it for their own benefit, or they believed it themselves, but at the very high levels like the Supreme Court, they're not there yet, they have a greater fucking investment than Trump as a person, but they don't want to get people to mad at him, which is why judges have been the ones were happy to do the dirty work that the republican party people can't do, the electeds can't do, they can't say move on, because they will get primaried just as surely as if they voted to impeach him. uh we talked a little bit on the show today about the whole thing about Aoc and uh and the healthcare vote and I would, I will say this, I said some more on the show, but to summit up the question about AOL and a vote in Congress for medicare for all versus uh uh whether or not to tie that to... a vote for polocious speaker, this is the this is the narrative media equivalent, this conversation we're having, everyone talking about it, it is sports talk. radio, it is the exact same thing as calling into mike and the mad dog to jawbone about whether the giants should draft a running back or a a wide receiver. it that is what its function is, it is, it is, it is off-season talk, it's off-season sports radio, because we have no influence on these people on sooever. there is no practical question, it is purely a moral question. Even if you you agree with with the argument that Aoc needs to do this to to draw on the sand or she is is fairly compromised, what are you gonna do about it? you gonna call her office? what does she care? in in in real terms she is only even hypothetically. uh answerable to her constituents in her district, and the greater progressive movement, they have no, there is first of all, there is none, and because there's none, there's no pressure they could put on her, so the question is purely a question of like her her worth as an individual, and that's meaningless, it means nothing, she is a tool, and it's a question of who's going to wield her, we, the left. which doesn't exist because it it the left doesn't exist, how could it wield a tool? how could the left be a hand to hold a tool if there's no body and no hand, so that's the you can, like i said, there should be sport uh political conversation that's like sports conversation, it's it's entertainment, it's talking about the weather with friends, it's a thing to talk about, but that's all it is, it's just a thing to talk about, and if it's a thing to talk about, i find it's not very interesting, so it solves itself, the question of like what it is, i've lost interest already, the only way you can convince yourself that it's a meaningful discussion to have is if you think it has actual meaning beyond idle speculation about what the front office is going to do about uh the... fucking quarterback position - oh man bitten on that conference call is great, it's perfect, he just wants them to give him a little gratitude for saving their. because in his mind he's the only person in the mind that such it exists, the mind that Trump Biden has and that all upper crust democrats have and filtering down into the even into the party faithful, they believe that this election proves has proven beyond a shout, this is a Trump country, that the average American out there in the Hinderlands away from us in our coast coasts and college towns is... is a savage is an unresolvable, unreasonable banging jackle of reaction, uh, a fucking cart like from a world war one propaganda uh poster about like the hun is a is a barbarian with a pickle hub holding a belgian version in his hands, and in that world in that America, the only thing that can win is somebody who appeals to... the least savage of the savages and that was, that was Biden and his whole Lincoln campaign approach, which hilariously was the same thing Hillary did and lost, indicating to these people they didn't do it enough, and the thing about that is, it doesn't matter if it's right or wrong, I mean I think it's pretty obviously wrong, and I i could i could collect sheeves of... documents about voter behavior and turnout and demographics proving that that's not the case and also like make a broader philosophical question about like the the the distorting and pomperizing social effect of of of the American electoral system and American politics and how it how it it turns us into like the shadow that we create in our elector systems is the worst of ourselves and that it's a terrible measure of like America's potential. and the personnel of the Democratic Party means that they have to run the campaign they ran against Trump. when he went economic populist, even though he didn't mean it, obviously he didn't mean it, as soon as he put down the gauntlet that he was going to be economically heterodox, the democrats were pinned, they could not go to his left economically, because they cannot raise the hopes of their voters, so they had to... run against Trump as an an aberation, as this monstrosity that is our worses and that we're all better than including republicans and it didn't work, but nothing changed in the intervening four years about the Democratic Party's funding model, organizational structure and personnel, to force it to change its calculus, so it had to run the play again, and now we have another out the uh the president oh president uh bumblefuck killing a half a on his way to killing a half a million people while farting on live tv six nights a week for four years uh is barely defeated in even the fucking popular vote uh and and sees negative coat and you see negative coat tales almost no negative coat tales in uh in the house and senate just but to them they will say this proves that the country is even more reactionary, which means that Biden is going to have to even further to the right as a governor than he had, it's the it's the one way crank that gets you that gets you uh, eventually like the the the goddam that we're all imagining of like the the trumpist republican party seasing power unilaterally, and yeah, like that's an uninterrupted road to that, if economic conditions deteriorate enough. It's a one way ratchet and so the whole and so this is why you know the the the the political uh media sphere is so often detached from real questions is because you can so easily get caught up in refuting the model, refuting the democrats by their logic of we're trying to win elections, we're trying to gain power, we're trying to push through progressive legislation, that's immaterial. to the actual question of why they do it and if they're going to keep being able to do it, that is determined by the array of forces and powers materially that undergird the Democratic party, and nothing about the discussion, nothing about the argument and no correct case to be made that like even in public uh opinion changes the way people view it, is going to change that basic dynamic. Yeah, now uh, no for, not for me, not for me these conversations anymore. how do we push president g to the last? there's the real question, how do we push general president g to the? what left? i mean, i know there are efforts, i know there are like communizing efforts in China. in fact uh it's there's a pretty funny phenomenon now in China where college kids go through the uh university indoctrination system and learn about marks as you know you do in chinese colleges and then come out and say oh uh wow all these working class workers. is sure could use some representation in government and then they get arrested, they say, no, no, no, not like that, we like a glacius's podcast? oh god, no, that sounds like oh, my stomach hurts even thinking about that. i don't think you would want me on either. I think he gets, I think he does, I think he hates me, which is nice because I think most of those people don't know who I am or pretend not to care, I know that he, I know that he is a uh, he is aware of uh online uh critics and is incredibly outraged by them, because he's got the Obama brain whereby he is fully confident that he has done the math on every question that matters and that he got the right answer and so anybody who disagrees with him and consistently is at the end of the day um uh being presumptuous, they're presuming to know something or understand something that he doesn't, which cannot be done, that is the iglacious like liberal obama, neolib brain, emmanuel mcron is another guy like that, Emmanuel Macron by the way, who is the one neoliberal uh leader who seems to grasp fundamentally that there is a irreconcilable conflict between democracy and like the liberal project, the neoliberal project, whatever you want to call it, and he uh has said yes, there is, so we got to get rid of the democracy, not all at once because people are used to it. but it's got to go, like even the vestiges of it have to be tamed, and of course he's the one gets that, because France is one of the western countries where like working class institutional power is most resilient, where uh, where uh coordinated uh demonstrations and and and and meaningful conflict with the state from the grassroots level is continuous and effective where the the worst of neoliberalism has been avoided, of course they're still on the same trajectory of us as we are, but it's from a higher point and it's going slow more slowly simply because there is more resistance to it as it's implemented unlike the brits and the Americans where we are just completely wick dogs and we have accepted neoliberalism completely and i will say the reason why they had a fucking they had a real revolution, you want to really boil it down to it like at a political level obviously there's material reasons that undergird that even but the answer to the same the political like... differentiation as they have a actual revolutionary tradition, by which I mean an idea of rebellion against govern a rebellion against oppression that that does not erroneously identify government as the only vector of oppression and that has a social conception of freedom and liberty that go beyond individual market participation and uh and so they've got a guy now who recognizes is like, okay, this is, this is got to go, and i think countries like uh, like our guys, i think they still believe that shit even in their hearts, because they can afford to, because we're we're not really putting up a fight, people are arguing about the merit of paris in in the commentary, well oh la la, a bunch of bunch of gentlemen and is curcing about, oh it's a Sunday in the park on le grand jet over here, somebody says the whiskey rebellion, I mean how is that even remembered as a fucking tax revolt, as a revolt against government, and a revolt against not exploitation, not like exploitation of labor or even like... manipulation of uh of like a market by like a monopoly uh uh purchaser, but tax, but but government taxation, because we never formed up uh a a a a a uh citizen rate, the way that the way that uh at least Paris and it's uh was able to, because before even was like fully full capitalism in in France, there was uh this proletarianism of artisanship, because Paris was filled with artisans, but they were fucking starving, and that was not generally common in the early modern city. we never had that, we had small cities, because you could get land anywhere, the land wasn't a patchwork of latifdia by fucking syphilitic dukes who controlled it all and and and treated them like internal monopoly markets and had like fucking tariff lines over everywhere you get went, there was land for the taking and we took it, and so that an understanding of there being a like a social reciprocal relationship that it was a fund fundamental undergurting of even any individual right was absent. our conception of rights and liberties were denatured, we're we're we're isolated, we're atomized because the free real estate, somebody ask guilty pleasures, i try not to have guilty pleasures anymore, i've tried to the guilty, you the concept of guilty pleasure emerged. as a way to give people otherwise were only consuming middle brow drack a sense that they had like higher artistic uh uh aspirations becuse like how many people talk about guilty pleasures who like would unironically talk about how moving like uh avengers endgame or black panther was you know like by any meaningful metric black panther or the Marvel movies in general would be a fucking guilty pleasure you'd feel guilty about it if the way they talk about art was valid, which I don't think it is. They created the category of guilty pleasure like awful reality shows that are even more like witless and uh and and less creative than big budget uh blockbusters and then say their feel oh that's I'm guilty about that to to essentially to elevate the crap that they take for real art. If you're consuming real art, concerning and when I say real, I don't mean like I'm not saying there's an objective criteria for that, I mean soul nour. if you're consuming that then you don't have this anxiety about dividing uh the good from the bad because you're not feeling the lack and that's the thing that unifies the entire broad middle populist brow of people who decided that actually everything you need to know about the world, everything you every emotional experience you need to have, every like intellectual idea every cattic bringing together of like image and sound and and uh and uh perspective into like a a to as a little prism to view through the to view another person's view of the world through like if you see art is that like somebody creating a perfect lens of observation and craft and poetry to have you look through and then the experience of art is just just seeing through it and the clearer it is the more beautiful it is and more you feel that, you feel a communion of spirits at some level, you feel something that is ineffable in your experience of it, and these people, the lotus eaters of the poptimus mainstream, I swear to god they don't feel that, but what they do is they feel the lack of it, and then they go out and seek to insist that it doesn't exist, that they're not missing anything, everybody who says there's anything more to art is lying to them to sound smart and fancy. that is the go-to argument of anyone who who uh brings down the wrath who who is who's outraged by by uh by large scale uh monocultural entertainment being besmerged is to say you don't really like that stuff you don't really read those books you don't really listen to that music you're you don't you're lying you just want to sound because why would you do that it's not fun well because it doesn't it's because fun isn't the only fucking metric there's other things to art. no there isn't, because if there was, they'd be missing something, and they can't even imagine that because they're so fully bought into the capitalist realist world, the and and have so conditioned their um coping mechanisms to be around that sense of identity and purpose and and intellectual challenge, it's essentially cultural gaming. and so they have to create this guilty pleasure, but if you want to say things that are objectively bad that I can't like argue are good that I still enjoy, I guess that's more it, like objective isn't a thing, but things that I couldn't make a plausible case even to myself are good, but I still like. That's a different thing, yeah, see, I guess SNL would have. work, but yeah, I never, I can't feel guilty for watching SNL, people are yelling about the raw meat, yeah, it's called the cannibal sandwich, it's not even all in Wisconsin by the way, it's only around Milwaque, in fact I was a little north, like other people who grew up near where I grew up, probably didn't never heard of it, but like I distinctly remember having a christmas in Shibogan, which is like about uh 30 to 45 minutes, about 30 minutes north of Milwaake right along the the uh, lake Michigan, so like 30 minutes up the lake Michigan shore from Milwaaki County is Shivoigan and I remember having a Shivoegan Christmas where there was set on a little table next to the Venisan uh uh and the the like the cheese curds and shit and uh the cocktail sauce were a bunch of uh little those little ry cocktail end pieces uh and then a bowl of ground shock raw ground shock that was then you descrip. take a a butterknife and you put it on and then you put on salt and pepper and raw onion and they call it cannibal sandwich and it is a leftover it's a remaining cultural food way of uh the Germans who made up like the first large scale European uh settling in uh Wisconsin Wisconsin was founded by uh by Yankee congregationalists both Michigan uh western New York uh the upper uh the case western the case the western reserve in Ohio, Michigan uh and uh Wisconsin were were were originally settled as like American uh territories by immigrants from uh New England so like the the children of the children of the puritans the the ended up being like the the the uh the social base for the Republican Party basically and the wigs before that uh but then the first uh large scale immigration to fill the the cities like Milwaaki was from Germany specifically Catholic southern Germany uh the beer drinking uh stein wielding party Germans not the dower militarist auster prussians uh party Germans and one of the great traditions in party Germany is ground pork raw ground pork or beef. and actually in uh, it's apparently a buffet food in Germany to this day and they shape it like a hedgehog and they put little uh they make it look look like a little hedgehog and then they put little slices of onion in the back to be like uh the quills brace 70s but even before it's uh and it still exists a little bit in Wisconsin like i i had it when i was a kid but it wasn't something that's stuck around like that we it's not like my family's been doing this recently uh and the reason people are hearing about this and freaking out about it is because Wisconsin asked people because of the danger of the raw meat please do not eat it and there were these people who of course were all supposed to laugh at saying fuck you i eat this every year uh take it from a gold at hand people like are you are these guys uh what's wrong with them? it is an actual wisconsin foodway it's not something that's terribly dangerous uh if the meat is fresh. and certainly if the fret if the meat comes from one cow and this is where things get like this is what where you can see like how how our folkways are so constrained and like and our and our freedoms like these guys our freedoms are constrained by things that we don't recognize as such like so these guys who are responding in the facebook comments saying fuck you uh they're probably mad at the state for being nanies and telling them don't eat raw meat, but the thing is is if you do go to piggy wiggly or IGA and buy a ground a pound of ground chuck and just spread it on bread, you'll probably shit your fucking guts out, it's a bad idea, don't do that, but the thing is traditionally that's not what people did, you would go to your rocal butcher and you would get a fresh ground meat and then you would eat that, but the thing is over the last 40, 50 years, all those local butchers have been driven out of business, and the only place you can get groundchuck is to go to the igi or the piggly wiggly, and so fewer and fewer people eat it, like i said, the last time i hate ate it, i was like eight, because most people even if they like it, they're not going to fucking roll the dice go into fucking uh grocery store, they know it's bad, they've gone to school, they know what raw food does, it's only going to be like the stubborn hold. them is not the nanny state, the thing they constrained their ability to get to because you shouldn't be able to, you should probably not get raw meat and then eat it like that from the grocery store, and maybe like the state should be involved in preventing that from happening, but that's not why people can't do it, they can't do it because uh they can't do it safely. they cannot do it safely and so you have to decide oh that's a thing we used to do and we used to like and we can't do it anymore and maybe somehow your brain vaguely thinks oh i bet it was lawsuits or something no it was the consolidation of fucking capital and people say it's like steak tartar but no it isn't steak tartar is a minced up steak and there's an egg on it and i think uh like mustard or stuff and that does like acid i mean uh acid cooking, the cannibal sandwich is just ground beef, but like i said you could get it from a butcher, fresh ground, that's not that dangerous, uh, also um apparently lebanon they eat raw beef too, raw raw ground beef or roundraw. and yes, yes, yes, yes, eating meat is indeed, monstrous, it is a regime of terror and blood and horror, and participating it at any level makes you a moral monster, and if we do survive as a species, i hope everyone is prepared for like if we do get some sort of uh space communist future, we will be viewed as monsters for what we've done to animals uh, but goddamn it, it's so good, it's so good, and all those questions receed in the face of a of a of a juicy steak or a nice pile of ground raw beef. i will say though that the uh the fake meat industry is coming along, i know it's uh soy based and uh and not based to uh want that, but I'm much looking forward to that McDonald's Mcplant, buse sometimes I want to eat the McDonald's flavor and I would love to do it without knowing that it involved some sort of fucking hostile style monstrous assault on uh all that's holy, but of course I think like they destroy half a like they destroy every every beyond burger you eat like destroyed a football fields worth of... palm trees in banda Ache or something. McDonald's fries do not have powdered beef fat in them. They used to though, they used to have like some sort of tallow uh extract on them, and people do say that they were way better back then, and you know what, I bet they were. I bet they were, I sadly don't remember them when they still had the beef on them though, the fact is industrial agricultural production, as we understand it for profit just cannot sustain itself, I mean from a moral perspective, but also just ecologically, I mean we're creating monocultural crops that are begging to be wiped out by some uh sort by... by disease and we're you know destroying the environment wherever we do large scale agriculture, destroying the water tables, it can't work, but you can't do craft farming either, you can't, that's not going to sustain a population, you need to do is what you need to do in every one of these industries, you need to take all of the mechanical and scientific development that we have done in agricultural production and then apply it to the question of... it really would it would do a lot, it would do a lot, it wouldn't solve everything and it wouldn't make everything perfect, but my god it would it would, it would make a lot of the things that seem, unscalably horrific in in their criminality and also in their unsustainability more manageable. The United States wastes half the food that it produces, that's not a that's not an exaggeration, and of course you can say, well, that's it's always tough to anticipate, but I mean that boils down to the fact that we have a uh, that we have a... food uh economy that is entirely built around profit and specifically built around profit in a uh like competitive market where choice and variety are the only things that matter and the only things that confer the ability to find points of like uh leverage to extract profit what people like the way that McDonald's the Mcgrib is back because uh pork uh prices went down i believe because of the trade war with China the Mcrip is back because the US uh because China banned imports of American pork uh as part as like a tit for tat thing for uh Trump's uh tariffs on Chinese goods and it led to a big glutt in pork bellies and porkbelly futures dropped and when that happens McDonald's buys a shit ton of pork bellies so that's why we have the McBritt back. after over what a decade, like an economy where that can happen, you have to have a lot of food just waiting to get destroyed and not distributed because that would reduce the the the market price of the of the rest of it, that's why they won't like they uh, rest supermarkets have to fucking destroy food that they don't sell, it's my... monstrous, it's a regime of monstrous waste, and it is to me the fundamental rejoinder to any idiotic argument, the capitalism is in any way efficient, an efficient allocation of resources. It would be funny though if we uh if we basically like detechnologized agriculture like had just had more people farm it's like to give them something to do. I think a lot of people kind of send them down to the countryside, you know, kind of, I don't know, like a some sort of rebellion in the in the superstructure, what do you call that, a cultural revolution? no, never mind, empty the suburbs I can get behind, I don't know how what the what like the balance of rural and urban uh life should be, that's way beyond my pay grade, I've... "i've read arguments in both directions, the need for like labor intensive, local agriculture, you know, intensification of infrastructure in in countryside, and and then arguments for no, no, and encourage minimal, minimal uh human footprint outside of urban areas and and create like dense density, uh, heard arguments for both, probably somewhere in the middle, all of it above my pay grade, not my question, not my circus, not my monkeys, because i sure" shit i'm never going to see a society where i have to add uh answer that question, it is certainly my duty to try to get us to a point where these questions mean something, but they're not there yet, but i do wish i knew more, i do wish i could farm, i'll say that, i wish i could, i wish i could farm. isn't the great reset, once again isn't the great reset just capitalism, i i never understand what this, especially it's it's very frustrating to see on the rightest with the q2, all of these big large scale like new world order things, it's just oh what, they're gonna a lot of people are going to die so the capitalism can maintain itself, right? they're going to keep. like every crisis of capitalism is going to just be met with more quantitative easing at the top and more like liquid money being pooled into the hands of the wealthy and just continue like a dynamo of... consumption at the very top of the the world uh consumption order that just like sucks everything out of the world literally like a giant straw until uh the ability of the earth to like uh actually hold uh maintain human life starts being compromised and people start dying and mass and and the political structure uh uh eliminates points of descent so that it can more effectively uh carry out a regime of uh of uh border enforcement and technological surveillance? am I saying anything that isn't just the trajectory of us? what is what is the thing that's supposed to be special about this? once again it's like we see it in front of us, we see the the creature, the monster operating in plain sight, there's no man behind the curtain, it's just it is, it's in front of the curtain, but it's too big to take in, so we vent, we create a mini version of it, a storytime fun time version. of it to to invest with meaning because it's easier to understand, so I don't even know what I'm supposed, what are the main points about it, they're going to sterilize everybody, we're being sterililized already, do you guys know what, what fucking plastics are doing to our endocrine systems, you know, like I mean obviously you don't want to turn into a redpill psycho talking about... male male virility, but sperm counts in the world are collapsing. I don't know if you're aware of this, and not just in the west, it's not just because oh yeah, you're all living next to uh, you're living in between the plastic, the you, you're eating mcdonald's and and uh just eating, no, in the least developed parts of the world too, is because plastic is becoming complete, it's becoming constitutive of the human fucking body, and it's disrupting your your endocrine system and ability to fucking reproduce. for literally already being children of men sterilized, what, what else do you need? what else? so what, what, what's special about the fucking great reset thing about it? what's the difference? because whether the broad thing is real, or this specific version of it, the fantasy version of it is real, this the challenge is the same, and the enemies are the same or should be, i mean if it's about how... like they're betting on what? it's like the people in power are making money off of the crisis and that in fact the the way they're responding the crisis is designed to make them more money. It's about market share, what you mean these people are gonna are gonna uh that that the continue to accumulation of capital is going to monopolize what and like Amazon's going to be the only company within the the generation what? I mean they don't even have to, they don't even have to sterilize or kill the unproductive and the unnecessary people, they just have to fucking put up a border because they're mostly sorted by geography. I guess like the thing that's most risible about all this need for to be like about to be eliminated is that I'm sorry if you're talking about the regrace great reset, you're not one of the people that the... want to reset, you're one of the fucking people that they still need to move numbers around on a fucking ledger and keep the the the flow of capital going, the people are going to get reset are nowhere near you and they're going to be kept that way with machinery and of surveillance and uh and violence. They're putting chemical. in the water to make the frogs gay, once again, yeah, they are, but not to make them gay. No, that doesn't kill them, there's been, I mean, not gay, but like, there's been like gender mutations in frogs thanks to exposure to, uh, atrazen, I believe it is. How many frog genders are there to quote uh to quote Joe Biden at least three? It would be funny if Trump tries now that Bar is resigning I guess it would be really funny if he tried to just appoint Sheriff Clark or something and just have them try to do a like order the FBI to arrest Congress or something I don't think they would do it but it'd be funny. hell yeah, make clay hagen's attorney general, yeah right there. we going to do it, we're going to do that cool, we're going to take back America, we're going to arrest that electron college, going to put it that good college, yep, going to get that electrone college, we going to get that google college in there, Avatar by the way was not a bit, people are now saying that uh, that we're doing it as a bit, no, we do think Avatar is great, and everything you say about how it's bad, it's like, yeah, that's true to, but it's a goostalt, movies are a goostalt, like the overall thing when I think about the movie and I watch it, I enjoy it. not ironically cuz i appreciate what went into it, and you can like that, you can do it, you can like a movie that's cringy, you can like a movie that has like identifiably stock or uninspiring or or cliche elements, you can like that, you're not being tricked into liking something necessarily, and i understand why people's backs are up because so much of a like blockbuster city. is about tricking you with that shit, but sometimes you got to accept some of it, a large enough scale of spectacle, you got to accept a certain skeleton, a certain degree of of stock elements, because it wouldn't be, you wouldn't be sustainable at that size without that, without that many viewers, without that broad of an audience expectation, yeah it's not a guilty pleasure uh Oh man, dune is going to bite, especially on TV now, I wasn't too excited about it either way, I really don't like that villain wave look at this point of the future, it's like, okay, it's uh, yeah, everything's all like dull and colorless, it's it seems like it's very nolen ask and it's blinkered understanding of like the possibilities, the aesthetic possibilities of life. All right guys, I'm going to sign off here, manks for the memories.
