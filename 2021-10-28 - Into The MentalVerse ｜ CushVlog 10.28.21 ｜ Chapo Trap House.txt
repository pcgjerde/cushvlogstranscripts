 living easy, living free, sees and take it on a one way ride, asking nothing, leave me be, taking everything in my stride, don't need reason, don't need run, there ain't nothing i'd rather do going down part it. time my friends are gonna be there too, i'm on a high way to hell, high way to hell, i'm on a high way to hell. Oh boy. All right, did stop? No, stop signs, speed limit, nobody gonna to me down, I go we all gonna spin it, nobody's gonna rest me around. so he has an interesting question, i know the metaverse isn't happening, but that's what they're pushing us to imagine as our future, which is what really matters because that's what's actually structuring our decisions now, is what we're imagining we're trying to push for, and this is what they're trying to imagine for us. This is their idea of what our future should be, and if we accept it, we will make it a reality, not the thing itself, but a deformed, narraled, pathetic, halfway version, which is what makes the metaverse as sketched out so depressing, it's already sucky, it already sucks shit, you're like, this is just second life. This is second life plus early 90s VR technology that people thought was lame by the second Clinton administration. And that's what we get to uh, that's what we get to live with. That's not even what we get to live with, that's not what we get to actually experience, I should say, that's what we get to live in the aspiration of, live in the in the pathetic uh contrails of live in the dust up, we get to live in the dust of this crappy future where we don't even get that level of lame interaction with a stupid fake universe, i mean my god, ready player one is supposed to be sort of a dystopia and it looks so much better than the fucking Zuckerberg verse and you get to do things other than go to fucking work meetings so anyway not great that that's the the carrot that they're going to be dangling in front of our face. they trudge us into the uh into the the hog shoots, but hey, it's not the only thing going, it's just what what they're right now trying to pitch as a way to make people think that there's some future for Facebook beyond being a angry grandpa meme aggregator which has a very limited market uh because it doesn't matter that it's incredibly profitable now, what matters for the future of the company and its stock is that it has this imagined future uh business because those old people are going to die, how are you going to appeal to the younger people if you are associated toxically with oldness? sure, you know, there are older people coming up, but maybe they're alienated from the entire uh concept of Facebook, they're not going to adopt it late, they're going to keep the things that they have, so they have to have some sort of thing that isn't old people uh yelling at people, old people yelling at the... grandkids for not liking their posts or whatever, now they do own instagram, so that's their youth play, but Facebook is the big enchilata and it's got to show a future uh market value, yeah right, like the old people, the young old young people when they get old they're going to keep doing discord or whatever the fuck. They're not going to switch to Facebook once they get a certain age, but yeah, they're only real hope is to buy the sector, buy the uh competition, monopolize the thing to set prices, that's it, that's all they can do, that's all any of them can play for, the monopoly play is the only play left because we've reached the terminal point of capital uh accumulation where it's no longer accumulating, at least not at the rate that commit with the need for growth in the system, and you know what, that's a good play, like if they get us to a point where we're mandatorily having to buy neck braces that explode if we don't look at Facebook enough, then it doesn't matter that they never built the multiverse that it was all a fucking chimera, because they will have the... they need, which is the ability to uh squeeze profit endlessly out of the system until of course the thing collapses and all we'll have then are the remnance of technological hierarchy left over from the destruction of the main circulatory system, what like once capital stops circulating through the system, which is when what we mean when we really talk about collapse, it's when the circulation of capital, trade networks break down, and then you're not going to just have people fleeing into anarchy or uh, doing a revolution, you're going to see regional concentrations of capital uh around certain technological structures that support them, asidering dominance, and so things like Facebook are going to be features of those new regimes of power, because they're necessary social architecture at this point. like Facebook is doing a a job, it is fulfilling a role in the market that is now thanks to the change of our living conditions, the atomization of life, the reconstitution of life online, is as vital as electricity, sewage and any other public utility, certainly the fucking telephone, it is now a thing people need the way that people need those things in order to have a functioning society at this level of complexity and population, sophistication is the word, so it's got to exist, but it can't exist as a profit making enterprise, because it will deform itself, like we have to all talk to each other online, uh, we have to have conduits for information and and and relationships that Facebook provides, but we do not need participation in it mangled by a algorithm that is determined by a add revenue model, if the thing is just administered neutrally, now of course, oh, there's no neutral administration in politics, yes of course, and it would become a political argument, but it would be an actual political argument, like what's so frustrating about people arguing about facebook and about big tech censorship is that you're talking about something that is outside of government regulatory structures at this point, because we're not treating it like a utility, like if it was an actual utility, at least the argument argument over what should go on there would have some sort of democratic input and deliberation behind it, it would not be dictated by profit, it's not perfect, but it's better, and I mean, Obviously all that really does is put a a layer of uh separation between a face. book and you know government that really just increases the latency of a transaction that is dominant like oh we're going to vote on it and make it public like that isn't then going to be what what we do with the public utility isn't going to be dictated by private interest in the system that is not a democracy but at least it would start as a wedge and it would be something that could maybe in live in the actual political system which is dying because of a lack. of any meaningful uh avenue of economic or i'm sorry of a democratic accountability, like everyone knows now that nothing is determined, nothing that matters is determined uh democratically, which is why all the most important, most passionately felt uh political beliefs people have are about culture. but of course a lot of it is putting cat carts before horses because it's difficult to imagine any real public democratic accountability for a tech the new leviathan tech sector short of a genuine revolution, you know, and that is the dirty little secret of online political disputation is that even people who are here to talk about politics and try to cut through sort of the noise of the spectacle of politics and try to get to what really matters, have to dance around the fact that we've reached a crisis point in the American democratic system relative to ' means that conventional politics up to including basically all electoral politics can have really nothing but an entertainment function. and that like if you wanted to determine what political act you taste take based on your real faith belief that it could do any good would have to be extra de extra electoral in a way that doesn't lend itself to public discussion. let me just say that. so how do you talk about things while talking around the unspoken fact? that everyone knows but no one can say that we are past the point when effective political action as in things you think in your heart of hearts things you believe things you believe are going to make things better uh can be anything other than resistance but the reason that people don't make that claim and make that jump in their personal. is for the very good reason that even the most extreme uh visions of resistance to the state that one could imagine would be at best sort of uh glorious like self-anniholation that that that there is no real capacity of uh organization in the current moment to allow for effective. resistance to whatever we want to think of as the state. the next best thing we have is local power in terms of supporting uh union organizing, supporting strikes when they happen, and participating in local politics as a way to base build. towards creating a broad coalition of working class interests as resistance at the workplace level accelerates, which I think it will, but the thing about that is it's not funny entertaining and more importantly relevant to everybody that you might be trying to communicate to, because these are local questions most of the time, and and people trying to interact with a local struggle are not going to be able to commiserate on any of the relevant questions because they don't have they're not in the room and they don't have skin in the game and they and they are... deserving from a position of disengagement from the material questions, like as in the stuff that's going to either make my life better or worse, like only in the most abstract sense, because you're not there, what that means is that if you want to get in there, and of course everyone wants to fucking get in there everyone wants to help, you find yourself applying questions, applying heuristics to the situation that are irrelevant. and that are going to most likely be made up of pre-concep pre-uh occupations defined by participation in and spectation of the national political uh debate sphere, which because nobody can talk about effective action because they can't do it, because it's either too dangerous or it's not uh, it's not relevant to a a audience that isn't strictly regional. and nobody has that anymore uh, all they can talk about is bullshit, all we can talk about is bullshit, you can either be having fun with it, or you can be trying to argue it in earnest, but either way you're responding to the the puppet show, i mean i know that's always seemed like the most triight observation about democracy is oh it's all just a sham but like the reason that that is not enough to say is because the degree of shamness matters and has practical considerations and impact strategy, so saying oh it's all a sham, it's all aspectle isn't enough, because there are degrees, like we had we had more democratic control of our of our uh, we had more formal democratic control over the decisions of the system that we are building in the 60s that we do now, now of course the elector was much smaller and it was racially segregated, which is in a large part why we could allow that level of democratic participation because it was screened away from the people who would most need to or be most inclined to get together to redistribute things. now those structures of democracy have imploded as the uh electorate has increased and that's been the way that American democracy has worked since the founding. as the system gets more complicated, as as our economy gets more complicated, as more technology is introduced into our structures, the formal amount of democracy in our system goes away, because there's too many decisions to make, there's too many decisions that are too important, that have to be made too quickly to allow for real democratic. anticipation in all in the way that you could have it in a previous generation when there were fewer decisions to make, and the pressure that this complexity puts on the system from below leads to the enlarging of the franchise and the increase of the number of people who are allowed to exercise electoral participation as a way of venting their uh alienation from the system. Now this is a process, this happens over time, and so we are at a point now where after having created a full formal electorate for the first time in America in the last 30 years, we've also created a uh post-70s technocracy, a a uh a political economy dictated by fully institutions that are undemocratic and and in fact anti-democratic like from the uh world bank and IMF to most crucially the federal reserve and then of course the military uh and the intelligence community. what that means is is that my opinion on what happens in a democracy this hollowed out means nothing. It might have meant something in a previous generation, because my vote had a me more meaningful impact on structures of power, if I could vote, if I was inside the bubble, well now more of us are inside that bubble of voting, but all that passion we have is all going towards making a decision that will have no meaningful impact on the system, that is a that is not. and that's what we're all doing, we're pretending to be political subjects and our participation in uh political media is part of that building of imagined political subjectivity. now real political action at this level is now effective action is going to be organizing in a way that is not spectacular the way electoral politics are. And because of all this we're now. sliding towards the creation of the end state of capitalism where it is fully detached from all human will, where our ruling class, the people in charge are effectively all along for the ride and are all incapable of acting in a way counter towards uh, a runaway, unmored uh profit accumulation algorithm, and what that will create is a situation where there is no more human ownership of anything, like in a meaningful sense, even our rulers will not really own anything, it will be owned by the algorithm, which will distribute according to that algorithm, now there's going to be making a lot of money and sitting in houses that they own, but it's essentially going to be an NFT situation, they're uh, they're allowed to sit there because someone's got to sit there, they're allowed to have access to that money because the profit has to go somewhere, because the machine itself doesn't want it, it only does it because it that's what it's there to do, it is inhuman, and and profit is a human, it has subjective human value, and that is not captured, priced into... the uh algorithm, so it's got to go somewhere, and it goes towards those people who uh, by happen stance are sitting uh right by the spout and everybody else will have their ownership of anything eventually denuded away so that everyone is renting their uh space on earth basically. now of course this is just the reverse, this is the this is the uh outcome of this is what happens when the human race fails to cohere and organize itself against this uh process which is what the uh socialist movement has been, what what Marx identified at the beginning of of the birth of modern capitalism was is that this machine would alien us all from our humanity completely, so that we literally own no material things including our bodies, and that we would we would all make this happen without wanting it to happen, well wanting some other thing, we would be making this thing without knowing it, everyone would be fighting for what they considered their own human self-interest, but what they were really serving the whole time was a system that is inhuman, and the only thing that could stop that. is if people organized as humans, as a human species, as members of a species and not as individuals, reforge a collective identity that that pervaded in humanity before the intervention of modernity, but with now the advanced technology accumulated by capitalism to use to express the species will... of the humanity and uh distribute resources accordingly, that's what that's what marks identified as the task of the working class as the leading edge of all humanity, because the working class would uh experience conditions of life that would alienate them from capitalism in a specific way that live together in close conditions and experience the reality of that and the reality of capitalism's role, it would essentially demystify them, and then they would organize and they would use their superior organizational skill and number as as as capitalism makes more and more proletarians and dispossesses more and more people until the point that their numbers uh their numbers uh overcome That's how, now I think Marx thought it would, and on closer terms than many of us, because he was creating a replacement for religion, he was replacing religion, but not with an ideology, with a vision of humanity that was a transformative one, that was Christian, that was the best expression of all religious traditions, in the reformation, what a lot of the protestant common people were trying to build was heaven on earth through the recreation of the conditions of the early church, which were holding of things in common, and that attempt was squashed by the earthly authorities, only allowed the reformation to the degree that it helped their power, and the old holy warriors, fought for a a uh fantasy a a a creation of a ruling elite, which was what Christianity was, that feeling of of righteous combat and righteous sacrifice on behalf of a cause can now be felt by people who can correctly see what the battle is, correctly see what the sides are and what the stakes are, in a way that people in previous orders where the hegemonic uh superstructures, the cultural realities imposed by the ruling class were absolute, and that was the condition of the pre-modern oppressed class, the serf, the slave, they could not live in a way that allowed them to effectively create a counterhegemonic understanding of the world, they had to live in the world imposed upon them by the church and by the king. and and the emperor whatever, and that ratified their subject position, and so you see like the gnostics and the antibaptists and the cathars and the fucking hutorites and all trying to build collective life. I mean, it's not a coincidence that the great peasants, German peasants revolt happens just a few years after the nailing of the these in the wintenberry cathedral, there was a a drive to make uh Christianity. the social uh, the the expressed social reality, to have it match, to have the social reality of living in Christianity match the vision of universal brotherhood, now of course it was cramped and wrong, because you could feel the alienation for the system and fight against it, but only using the vocabulary of your rulers, the creation of capitalism, the creation of this ever increasing pool proletarianized people who live are forced to live together and struggle in the same conditions creates not just disillusionment with the system and the feeling of oppression, but also solidarity, and marx is saying every previous resistance to capital to a regime of power ends and collapse or domination of one by the other because they're all... religiosity and sociality are fused. and use and technology, the technology of mass media and consolidation of labor power into machines allows you to actually express it, the reason that those uh those those efforts to create a just christendom failed is because the tools to distribute uh resources equitably didn't exist, there was not sufficient concentrated capital around means of production to do that, when the antibaptists took monster, they basically just hung around and waited for the world to end because none of them could underst, none of them had any ability to create a functioning economy. and so they ended up just waiting for the world and then it did when the emperor came and killed all of them, because that was the one red line in the reformation, the reformation threw a most of the the the deeply held notions of the western catholic church into question, the one that couldn't be questioned was infant baptism, even though one of the chief objections of protestantism was that the the catholic church did a bunch of shit that wasn't in the bible, they'... a bunch of shit up and that that was wrong buse the bible is the only true authority, everything else is fallen and and deformed by man, but infant baptism isn't in the fucking bible, but what infant baptism was was not a baptism into a religion, it was a baptism into a social world, a hierarchy, and to say I get to be baptized as an adult, I get to choose to enter this community, is to challenge the entire social order. but it couldn't work because there wasn't sufficient social technology or uh economic technology around to redistribute labor effectively, we are at that point, we are passed the point where capitalism has created the means to allow a socially coherent working class uh socially coherent working class with its own internal machines, technologies of belief and hearing people to a project at the center of the technological nexus, at at the nodes of power, able to turn the knobs, you could do it, we could do it. It would essentially be humans taking over the machine from the algorithm and then building a world where nothing is privately owned, but nothing is rented either, like provision for life is taken for granted, and your participation in the world with others, the building, the making of an economy. the the the distribution of resources, the building of a culture, the managing of those things is not participating in a market out of self-interest, out of homo-economics desire to maximize profit for myself and to hold surplus to enjoy materially, but is is a spiritual communion with a social organism. and that sounds crazy wacky, crazy, insane, but I swear to God, it isn't. The thing that makes it seem insane is the idea that we are all, that we all have as a loadstone around our neck, is uh, human nature, which is just the secularized version of original sin. It is capitalism, it is secular capital. recapitulation at the social level of belief in capitalism, just as original sin was the functioning structure, the is the defining mental structure that adhered one to the society of orders in the Christian west, I am fallen, I have sinned, therefore I must accept my lot, it's essentially. a a westernized version of the cast idea, your position in life is determined by your worthiness, but all are all are fallen, but what of course is making you fall is living under these conditions, the reproduced social exploitation of a class society where bad is called good where you literally live in a matrix of ideology. that turns virtue into vice and vice versa. now we killed God, we can't tell you that you are where you are because God wants: to be there buse not nobody nobody really believes in god anymore, well what they do believe in is that they're human beings and that they're in a natural order, well part of that natural order is the idea that humans are wired to self-seek at the expensive of other people, and that's why we can't do what i talked about, you can't create socialized structures of of economic because they'll just be horded by the mob and selfishly used by uh by elites who then use their position to exploit everybody else. yeah, if we did that, yes, that's what would happen, but we wouldn't do that. the people doing that machine, the people operating that social machinery are not us. they have been transformed over time and struggle. because you don't get that immediately, that's the result of a fucking long human organizational task. the best example of this would be the Cuban revolution. the reason the Cuba one of the reasons that Cuba has survived in the form it has without becoming a cult of personality terror state like North Korea, sorry haters, but that's what it is, was by building faithh in the system, and that means not just people are subject to the system, but the people administer the system, that doesn't mean there's no corruption in Cuba, it doesn't mean it's perfect, what it means is the corruption and the exploitation are not so vast as to alienate the population at a mass scale, in a way they can't be managed with the escape valve of emigration, of course the conditions of that exploitation and that corruption are economic deprivation. If you have a if you have post scarcity plus if you have a post scarcity uh context and you have sufficient technology to distribute uncomfortable labor away from uh the human experience and people actually have values that are outside of... the guilt matrix of living in capitalism, feeling either guilt or resentment at all times and having to do something with that resentment or guilt, that combination that everybody is filled with at all times under capitalism, that everybody is filled, i should say at all times under class or rule, there's a class system is bifricated, and that means everybody is is guilty of exploitation or is a victim of exploitation, but of course because this is a very complicated social organism, this is great, this is not just at some point there's an inflection, but there is a gradient and there's a middle category of people who are both, and everybody feels guilt and resentment in some marbling, the more popular, the more powerful you are, the more it's just plain guilt, and of course some of the richest people in the world are incredibly resentful, but of course that is resenting people for making them feel guilt. and of course at the very bottom, what do you have to feel guilty about other than the personal guilt of uh committing harm to people around you, which happens a lot more when you're fucking miserable all the time, it is a parasitic relationship and it's no good for either side, it is bad for your soul, and so your interaction with the world become selfish and dedicated to ignoring that feeling. and the only uh thing to ignore it with is is that which could be purchased in the market, either in the form of direct consumption or social standing elevation, which you get to feel good about, and the the pursuit of social standing. Now out of this, this this sandwich of pain and resentment is forged the socialist movement, but it has to struggle in the context of capitalism as part of a cast society, when when communism finally happens in the Soviet Union, it is not in the context of world revolution, and the seagure of the means of production at the center that that Lenin and Tratsky imagined, but in the isolation. of a economically backward, feudal world that then had to confront and compete with capitalism on its terms from a position of of... deep deficits and it did the job, as people have said, miracle, but what it, but it did kill millions of people to make it happen, you cannot deny that, and the reality of that is that it it makes the project less believable to people who live through that and the kill the people that they give birth to and raise, it disillusion, the the necessary social belief that powers communism. is undermined and no one in the social bolshevic party at the top would have supported the October revolution if they thought they'd had to go it alone. I would challenge anybody who disagrees with that. They would not have done it if they thought they had to go it along, because they knew, they all knew what would have what that would require, it would require war on the peasantry. because turning an agricultural population into an urban one is a violent horrifying process that capitalism had had had uh carried out in the rest of the world, either through enclosure and uh violence uh labor violence at the center or through uh colonization from uh outside. This is the first time that communism is asked to do this violent work, and yes, it does it, and it beats the nazis, but by the 50s, they're left with the task of trying to compete with the west to create a consumer economy after they have lost the faith of the people, they say, look, we're just the state like other states, we're we're an elite, but we can give you... better standard of living than you can get in the west, you can give you more stuff, and the thing is the stuff that they could give them that we couldn't give our people, like guaranteed healthcare, guaranteed uh housing and employment in a in a position of social alienation, in a in a context of social alienation, that's not what people need, that's not what people notice missing, because in the west where capitalism has uh where where the hegemonic process of capitalism recreated our social order and our understanding of our place of society, we don't feel entitled to those things, we feel like those are rewards too, what the what the uh state is in charge of is all the pleasures, what the state is in charge of is whether or not we can uh access consumer convenience, because that is our only. acceptable form of relief from the anguish of capitalism, we can do drugs, some of those are legal and you can contribute to the economy by buying them, others aren't and you can contribute by to the intelligence community by buying those, but mostly you have to buy things and the government's job is to allow you to buy as much plus stuff as possible. and give you the opportunity to contribute or to the opportunity to compete in a market, not only for stuff, but for status, and and with that question, with that as the as the motor society, hey, we're going to have you guys build a we're going to have you guys work in factories, and then we're going to give you stuff, but in the in the east, you're going to believe that you are a a public you are working for the state and then the state gives you some shitty fucking uh appliances uh and and they have deep scarcity because they have a much smaller reservoir of raw materials and a less less developed uh industry than the east does at half of it got blown up by World War II they had to start from scratch practically in a lot of the country United States is uh industrial heartland was untouched and in fact massively expanded by the war, but in the west, you work, you work hard for yourself, yes you have a boss, but you are earning money, you're not working for the state, and then you can take that money and buy things and you can buy more things than your neighbor, and if you work harder you can buy even more things, not going to win that contest, you can't, that is why somebody said, and I forgot to even mention it because I got sidetracked, but at the beginning of the of the very beginning of the chat somebody asked. of all of my pet counterfactuals, which one would you like to be able to read like the magic transdimensional wikipedia uh article about? like which of these features if you could pick one would you like to get onto a a magic laptop and read the history of uh in a world where it happened, and i got to say at this point, what if the soviet union had never existed? and the thing about this one is that it is the closest call of any of the big ones, the thing about reconstruction uh the German uh working class uniting against capitalism in 1918, these things are when you really look at them very overdetermined, but the bulshevic revolution is such a close-run thing, it is so uh so contingent. If you look at it uh, if you look at the situation in uh Petragrad after the February revolution, and the the absolute terror and paralysis at the top of the bolschevic party. It is impossible for me to imagine them carrying off the October revolution without Lenin showing up, and that is a contingent event. or anything happens to Leninn between his arrival at the Finland station in October, I think they break up because none of them had the full confidence that they would win and the confidence to imagine themselves in a position of power afterwards, and for good reason they were mostly a bunch of fucking fuckups, they were all there was a com it was a bunch of people who had been sitting in coffee shops their entire lives arguing, about posts and they were being asked to take over a government. Lenin was able to do it because of the vastness of his intellect and his full confidence in himself, which was mostly completely warranted, but one of the key things firing him towards October was the steely belief that they were going to kick off a world revolution, something that trotski had convinced of him, because a guy of Lenin's capacity. cannot be told your time in history is not arrived yet, you have to sit back, it's absurd, he has to think of a way to imagine that he can, even though there is no develop socialism in Russia at this point, there is no working class, the country is 90% peasant. but you have to imagine a world where you can take power and effectively wield it towards building world socialism and looking at Russia that's hard to imagine unless you also imagine a world revolution and I am not saying that we that would be better, I just think it would be dramatically different and very... very easy to imagine, now I do think that if there if the bolsheviks don't sees power in October, I do believe that there is a military coo. I think that Korenski gets uh, gets uh, somebody said that would be very similar to the Mexican revolution where Maduro gets uh overthrown and executed by Joerta. I think you going to see you to see something like that, and that would be a deep blow to... the world socialist movement uh and there would be great disarray and uh panic after that uh and it would, but it would it would change the the uh the flow of all the flow of all uh it would it would absolutely impact everything massively in the United States the soviet the establishment of the Soviet Union helped lead to the red scare now without the... winning without the ability to terrify people about the idea of a red army that was running around killing people at least as far as the newspapers were reporting and not creating a workers paradise, maybe the socialist movement stays coherent and gains popularity as it had been until that point, or maybe it dissipates. now in this situation, the German revolution of 198. i think still doesn't happen, but and i think you still see the SDP, spd rather, i keep fucking it up because stupid german, the spd. does sick the free core on the workers no matter what, but maybe you don't see the massive uh formalized and reinforced division between the communist party of Germany and the social democrats that makes it them incapable of coming together uh in the richstog to resist the naziss and that means you still... have a World War II, you still have the apocalyptic confrontation over capitalism in Europe in crisis, but what do the lines of it look like? Is it just another bourgeois versus bourgeois uh battle of resources like World War I had been? Or do intervening years of uh striking and uh worker activism lead to an actual class war, at least in Europe, maybe with the US under Roosevelt, although what happens in the us if that does isn't the occurre, maybe us under uh debs, or not bebbs by that point, but you know, upton sinclair, maybe helping contribute, I don't know, no way to say, and that is why I would really like to. read it, and I, no, I basically just described keizer, or no, heart of iron right, or keizerrek, so I guess that's how you find out what that would look like as if you play Kaizerrek. I know people, I know in in in those stories like syndicalism becomes the main uh organizing uh mechanism, I don't know if that would have happened, I can see the argument, but I think maybe you just have a strengthening of the uh of like the reformist democratic tradition, which of course is insufficient, but like I said, maybe builds up structures and allies with labor in a way that allows them to... be a competent and meaningful uh locus of force in a coming confrontation. yeah, but of course you can't forget that you know the soviets winning, it did create a new era in world history and all of the... uh accommodations with humanity that capitalism made in the 20th century were in a condition of being under the threat of the soviet competition, but if you delay the confrontation and you geographically redirect the center of power of the of the struggle, maybe you kick off the chain reaction. that pushes us towards a socialization of means of production rather than the uh, i won't even say privatization, because i said no human actually owns it, the uh the full alienation of the means of production, which is what we currently are moving towards. Somebody's asking about Napoleon? I think the reason I root for Napoleon and why his defeat was a disaster for humanity in my opinion, is because I do really believe that Capitalism is, modern capitalism is not something that just emerged amorphusly across the world uh social order. It is something that emerged concretely and and materially in England. and then it took over the world from there uh starting with enclosure and ending with the uh glorious revolution, you see the transformation of the English economy and its political culture and and religious culture, that makes a new form of state, and that European capitalists, capitalism is infinilly is essentially uh imposed from without on the rest of Europe and then on the rest of the world through colonialism. Uh, that's why I think that there really isn't a conflict between Brenner and Wallenstein, because I feel like Brenner describes how capitalism is born, and then Wallenstein describes how it was exported and came to take over the the world. um so what that means for me is that well while capitalism does emerge uh in France, it is not it is this alien intervention uh and by the time of even the French revolution it is not fully like uh materialized and and and developed yet and the revolution in the French revolution because of it happened so much later, it happens in a moment of secular enlightenment, it's able to define like the interest of the people in a more uh secularized fashion than what happened in England where their revolution was headquartered was headed up by a bunch of puritan religious fanatics, and that has an impact. on the development of the social order from that point forward and it it it mystifies the social relationship that emerges, there is a clarity to the social relationship is understood under by by that first articulation, modern articulation of of the bourgeois, not because is not the same thing as capitalists existed before, people existed before capitalism emerged. It just meant people who lived in the cities and lived off of trade uh and commerce rather than through direct uh agricultural work, and that category becomes sort of the the class that powers the development of capitalism uh, but it was one before that, just as the working class is something that always existed, but it increases size and increases internal consistency and political uh political. mobilization and and organization over time, but yeah of course the the thing is like a nationally a nationalized sense of uh of a nationalized sense of duty and wellbeing or whatever uh fus to an advanced economy is fascism basically, but you need... uh, fashism happens because of the continued dominance of capitalism, which you in this instance would assume would be interrupted and arrested in some way, because Napoleon, the first one really did want to impose a universal, not particular meritocracy, uh, and yes, people say, oh, he seeed the... crowned the the the the crowns of Europe with his family, yeah, because he had deserved it, and he he trusted them. uh, he was essentially refreshing the aristocratic uh uh ranks, getting rid of the deadwood, making it more efficient, which is because of the pressure of capitalism, but it's still maintained the idea of human power over economic power. now what the fucking what capitalism did is it took the idea of uh of of meritocracy and turned it eventually into aristocracy, but did a few extra steps, so now we think we live, or many of us do in some sort of system where people are in positions of power and wealth due to when in fact they are as to the manner born as incompetent and generally uh useless, unchallenged, vapid, and fundamentally incompetent as the decrepid ruling houses of Europe in the 18th and 19th century, but yeah, no, interesting to... but yeah, no, if you give me one to look at, it would be uh, like the sealed train from Switzerland derails or something, yeah, exactly, Napoleon can't be a fascist anymore than Julius Caesar, he turned it into a reactionary. He turn it into an empire because there could be a republic, because it wasn't ready. You got to put it back in the oven. All right, that's that's that's fine, that's good. All right, talk to y'all soon, peace.
