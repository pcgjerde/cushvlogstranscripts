 band folks, don't we love it, we love the band from ireland, macm's band, those cats could play, jack, let me tell you, i don't all about it, going to london i was only 16 with a fiber in my pocket my old don some day i went down to the delly to check out the scene but i still in. get up upon the old drag, it was cold winter nights, they all knew it was chill, there are boys in the cafes and get you, didn't have the money, always lots of drag. revenge of the lips, revenge of the lips, post, let's take a look, there we go, click. I was lying down in laster square, got kicked up by the coppers and kicked in the balls, doing the metal doors at vine street, I was beaten and malled and I ruined my good looks for the old main drag, so guys and girls, uh, I am now able to command the uh the stream, I don't have to use my phone anymore, this is wild, I get to click on a little button and it just streams my computer camera, amazing uh, it's a game changer, we've entered a new phase, we've entered the phase omega of the uh of the streams. so today we're going to be talking about chapters 9 and 10 uh in Eric Founder's reconstruction chapter nine, the problem of enforcement is about white resistance to reconstruction and uh chapter 10 is about reconstruction in the north and how it impacted the uh political agenda of the Republican Party and their uh willingness to continue supporting reconstruction based. so after the imposition of the uh the southern republican reconstruction governments uh the white democrats of the south which was obviously the majority of all of the land owners and most of the white people outside of unionist strongholds uh realized that their policy of basically pretending that it was happening and abstaining from elections wasn't working uh like in Mississippi they were able to prevent a constitutional um uh the state constitution from being ratified by boycotting because it uh failed to produce a necessary uh the necess what was required as the necessary uh voter turnout to to make the vote binding but they just changed that requirement and put it back in anyway so uh the democrats in the south realized that it wasn't working and so two strategies of how to go about dealing with the political system and with the reality of reconstruction and black suffrage uh and in the south, first you had the white line democrats, the ones who insisted upon uh white supremacy uh as the cornerstone of governance and denied the validity of the reconstruction governments entirely uh and the in and denied the validity of black uh suffrage entirely uh, but more influential and more successful were those democrats who uh uh accepted as a fair to com ple the reality of reconstruction, the reality of black suffrage uh, and and called instead for a new departure, which said, all right, fine, there's black suffrage, we can't stop it, what can we do? uh, and what they did was they they joined the republicans or they joined factions of republican parties uh outside the deep south where the uh the black vote wasn't completely dominated or completely like uh organized around the republican party uh in states like Virginia and Tennessee uh the in the 1869 and 1870 the uh new departure democrats allied with conservative Republicans were able to uh win and take over uh their agenda, their economic agenda was totally. hostile to free slaves, even though they made grudging attempts to uh reach out to black voters, uh, but it was attractive to poor whites because it emphasized lowering taxes, because one of the big consequences of reconstruction government was a huge increase in public provision, which also led to an increase in taxation uh, which squeezed low uh, small holding farmers and poor whites harder even than it did the uh the the rich ways um and the other element was uh agrarian reform, the idea being that if we cannot deny uh black suffrage, if we cannot deny black civic equality, then we can reduce black labor power by utilizing uh new... farming technology uh advanced uh uh advanced like irrigation and fertilizing techniques and encouraging immigration uh from either like Ireland or even China uh to break the uh the late the to break the black uh laboring classes ability to negotiate the the conditions of their work. uh, even George Fitzhu, I've talked about before, who was before the war, an author of a number of works that controversially, even in the south claimed that uh, wage relationships uh within the white race were wrong, and that honestly everybody should be either a slave or a uh owner, because democracy was a fraud that assumed in equality that was not possible, but in the aftermath of the war, he saw the way the winds were blowing and he became a big booster for the uh bringing of capital to the south all on the idea that you're going to reduce the uh effectiveness of black labor and political organizing uh there's one quote in the book about how someone says we need to bring in the great the most advanced uh farming machinery, one of the advantages of which is that it can't vote. uh, but the thing that styinied a lot of these efforts is, as was always the case in reconstruction capital, like for example, one of the big uh agricultural modernizing projects was introducing mixed uh planting, instead of having just entire regions dominated by cotton planting, and that was possible in some northern parts of the south, but in the the black belt in the cotton belt. uh, it would have required very expensive fertilizer, which would have required capital that during this period the south just was not getting, and then you have the fact that the crop lean system where everybody was on operating on credit, the the planters were operating on credit from banks, the sharers were operating on credit from the planters, it didn't, it created a path dependency where there wasn't really no one could afford to miss a harvest. could afford to not be putting out uh cotton, so diversifying became uh kind of a non-starter. so places where the uh these new departure democrats took power in these border areas like Virginia by the way uh Virginia had a a democratic republican right-wing republican fusion government takeover partially because the radical republican uh coalition uh headed by that the newspaper writer newspaper editor uh honeycut which I talked about last time and which actually did bring together uh poorer and and ex slaves uh around a really radical economic agenda uh that and and who passed a radical constitutional or created a radical constitutional convention uh and and and a radical constitution uh the union general who was in command of uh Virginia James John Scofield refused to allow a vote on it so uh into that vacuum the uh the redeeming new departure democrats took power and wherever they did, they implemented voter restrictions that were just on the right side of the 15th amendment which guaranteed voting uh regardless of uh right, voting rights regardless of rates, that meant um poll taxes uh and it should be noted that there's two types of poll taxes and you see some confusion with this, like uh for example there was a bunch of there was in the 80s there was a huge amount of protesting in England about the poll tax. and poll in that sense and in American history also in some places, pole means head, and it is a regressive tax on individuals, like x, if x number of people live in a county every one of them owes x number of dollars in in in uh, in taxes, which of course is regressive because rich people can afford to pay it more than poor, because it's fixed by just the fact that it's it's a it's a fixed amount per person uh, but these were poll taxes i said you had to pay money to vote uh, it also reduced the number of polling places in in uh uh black strongholds if that sounds familiar uh and Jerry Mander districts away from uh Black Bell Counties once again if any of this sounds familiar and in addition to that they also resinded all of the uh legislation that the radical regimes had done to help uh free slave uh free slaves and and poor people uh uh prosper and and negotiate their own terms of employment uh they got rid of uh foraging rights which are very big because if you can forage it means you don't necessarily have to take a wage or work a cropling uh and also the homestead exemption from debt repayments and the rule that uh meant that the laborers uh claim to a crop superseded any uh other debters uh or any other lenders that the uh that the planter might know uh and this was all uh in the deep south where the the republican governments held power simply because of the the still significant and unified power of the black vote uh with a huge... explosion in violence and the forming of the Kucklucks clan. This is the part of the book that if you read it is the most nouseating and enraging part yet, where you see in response to the institution of these uh radical republican interracial regimes, a huge explosion in political violence, massacres, linchings, whipping. targeted assassinations of community leaders, also white republicans as well, with specific intent to attack people who had any kind of political expression, labor, labor militancy, and very importantly, any pretentions to ownership of property, and this is like the key element to the failure of reconstruction or one of them, and it's uh maddening because it was not ordained and necessary, it was not like some sort of uh stimulus response that could not have been either precluded or stopped once it started, and it's important to remember that it was made up that this reaction, this the clan uh violence, the people who carried it out were uh not just just poor white trash, they were a whole swath of white society in these places and generally led by the better elements, the professionals, the land owners. uh, it was a in many ways a planter reaction to the rise of of black power, and one of the most frustrating things reading it is seeing how powerless people were to stop it, even though republican regimes were empowered in many of these states, even though uh, you know, you had huge numbers of ex- slaves living here now as free people, technically as equal citizens with rights, uh, there was very little response to the violence, there was very little uh tit for tat and there was very little defensive violence, and and this was something that in the north a lot of people found kind of pathetic, they said why don't you stand up for yourself, which is ridiculous, because they were in a situation where the the uh social milieu meant that any white violence would be ratified by local power, like the local courts, local government, and any violence by Friedman would be instantly cracked down upon, with no, because in most of these places there's barely any federal presence, there were uh less than 6,00 us troops in the south, I believe by this point, scattered throughout the entire region, and so even if there had been a desire on the part of the federal government at that point to crack down, which there wasn't, there would have been very much difficulty in having those resources deployed, it was, it was very difficult to imagine a situation where if you uh, stood up for yourself, anything would happen other than just a total smackdown and destruction of your the entire area, and this violence was very, very effective at undermining reconstruction, because the people who were killed were generally people who had achieved some. of literacy uh and political influence and had shown themselves to be leaders and had in many cases leadership of a bunch of different intersecting civic organizations and political groups which meant that you could essentially decapitate uh ex slave political power by killing only a few people because so many of of the ex slaves had no education and had no literacy and as such had a very difficult time negotiating. a lot of these uh these power structures, the people who could kind of made themselves targets in a way and were violently uh repressed, and this is why you really can't think of a civil war is ending in 1865, it's just moved to a different phase, people say, oh Roberty Lee was so uh gallant and and and honorable because he didn't send the army off to do gorilla fighting, well they didn't do it then, but they did it later uh, and it's important to know they were allowed. uh, because where state governments decided to crack down, state governments here, because as I said, the federal power to do anything was was pretty muted, where state governments acted, where there was a reconstruction, a radical government in place with that had any kind of legitimacy and efficacy, they were able to crack the fuck down on these guys, the two most sterling examples were arkansaw in Texas, which both saw uh their radical governors uh creating uh uh interracial police and militia units at the state level that just arrested the shit out of people, just went in there and fucking and and threw people in jail and it led to uh in Texas uh governor Edmond Davis had 6,00 clans and arrested uh and it had an effect, they people didn't fight, I mean the violence was was so wide spread because impunity was assumed, I mean these people are fucking cowards uh, if they think they're going to get in trouble. they're not going to do it, and I would like, and uh, one of the most horrifying and the the single most violent uh incident of all of reconstruction was the colefax massacre, which occurs at this time, in which uh, a struggle between local factions in uh, in Colfax, Louisiana leads to a black militia essentially uh, take commandeering and taking control of a city, town square there. in Colfax for uh a number of days until uh they were just overwhelmed by a uh a redeamer militia that massacred over 200 of them with no repercussions, but where there was a state response there was a reduction in violence, there was a capacity to do this, but there had to be uh a mechanism uh for uh where where the state was willing to enforce? and back up black claims to rights and the big effect of all this violence is is that it brought a big decline in black turn out as you can imagine and it led to democrats gaining uh yeah of course of course texas public school history called him a tyrant, yeah, no, he was a, he was a pimp, sorry, edmond Davis Pimp, Benjamin Butler, because guys like that realize something that is lost in history and was even lost at the time to the the liberal republicans in the north, which is that they wanted to see this as a political struggle, they wanted to see the the battle over who will be in charge of these governments in the south, a political discussion, but it was not, it was for the republicans, the the former slaves and the scalowags and carpet baggers who were trying to govern these these these states, they were operating by political rules, they were trying to, they were trying to raise votes and they were trying to win elections, for the white power structure, it was an existential war, it was a war that had never ended, since 65, and when you have... that kind of situation where one side is willing to go beyond politics and the other one is constrained by political uh conceptions uh the the side that is willing to take the most extreme measures will win unless the other side understands the the the real terrain and acts accordingly and they will attempts to do that but they were half-hearted half hazard and not. and this is why my big dream, my big what if at this point it isn't even that Lincoln lives so much as that butler is vice president, because if Butler is vice president and Lincoln still gets assassinated, I have a hard time imagining that we get any period of reprieve for the planter class and certainly not the confederate high command, I mean this is a guy when he was the military governor of New Orleans hanged a guy for... pulling down the American flag and stepping on it, even though everybody assumed he wouldn't hang this guy, they were like, there's no way he's going to hang a guy for taking a flag down, that's insane, he's going to like try him and then he'll the guy will give a speech and then he'll he'll commute the sentence, and they had they had a big, they had a big deal, they let the guy give a talk, he said i'm doing it patriotically, everyone is waiting for butler to give him the old uh give him the the lindsay buckingham glad handlex g and instead he's like no hang the motherfucker. so it's hard to imagine that if he gets into power with with fucking Lincoln's blood on his hands that uh that he would have been nearly as as uh conciliatory to these people as Andrew Johnson was uh but what this really boils down to more than anything is that by this point and this is the important thing by this point at this point in time after the initial failures after uh the railroad lobby had essentially bought the Republican Party, there was just no commitment in the northern Republican party to uh do anything other than let the south sort of figure its out, figure its own shit out. there was no real commitment to the display of force, the the transgression of norms uh that would have been required to actually do something. but eventually they kind of had to uh, the grant regime though was very slow in dealing with things, and this is where we got to talk about grant a little bit. i know that i've said that grant is underrated uh, and he is relative to his traditional position in American history, and certainly compared to the duning school fucking propaganda hot shit, poor shit, but uh, he was not the man for the job, not the man the times demanded. uh, the very fact that he was the nominee spoke to the rise of this conservative sort of uh fiscally oriented section of the republican party over the radical spirit that had sort of got it out and uh and had essentially uh gathered to ensure that Benjamin Wade didn't get the nomination in 1870 1868 uh but had his upsides uh and one of them was that he actually did eventually uh crack down on uh on the claim but that in that uh the impodus for that came from congress in the form of the Kucklucks clan act which was uh shepherded through the house by Benjamin butler and which led to a uh massive number of arrests in in the areas of peak clan violence in the pemonts south and uh led to a huge reduction in violence. one thing that did happen under Grant was the 15th amendment which is uh very interesting because one of the reasons that black suffrage was not the silver bullet that a lot of northern republicans assumed it would be, like republicans who are very leary about getting into questions of redistribution and positive liberty because of their liber their liberal ideology uh put all of their faith in the ball, let black people vote and they will be integrated in the political system and we will not need to uh change the relations. between subjects of a government and uh and the government itself in terms of like it's what it what is what its provisions are uh and one of the things that made that impossible is that the 15th amendment while it banns uh discrimination on race for voting it does not it did not actually remove impediments to voting that existed in northern states or make voting a actual right which it still isn't. "we kind of think of voting as a right, but it's it still really is more of a privilege in the constitutional section, in the in the constitutional sense, uh, like equal provision of the ballot is is considered anathema racially, but other than that, states are sort of at their discretion to figure out who is allowed to vote, which is a holdover from the old constitu old early constitutional era, and was one of many things that should have been done away with by the civil war, the civil war should have proven the ridiculousness of that." and but it didn't because the array of forces weren't sufficient to to change that relationship uh and northern republicans were incredibly scared of the urban immigrant population that they had in their cities, catholic, foreign language people, democrats and the and as a result, many northern states that were governed by republicans had voting restrictions on the books, things like tax requirements for voting. uh and property restrictions, and they didn't want to give those up, they didn't want to undermine their control there, because the the republican party was much more centered in the north than the south, and the southern republicans had very little influence in DC, uh, northern republicans controlled the party, controlled the direction of the party, and they wanted to maintain their power in the states that they control. uh, and it should be noted that uh even though the the one of the knocks on the 15th amendment at the time was that it was a special amendment that was specially designed for blacks and did not cover everybody uh most ex slaves in the political arena and uh said no this should be universalized because that is the radical wellspring of uh of the black political tradition in this country comes from the fact that there's nobody that black people can sell out it's not because better than the rest of us, which is sort of, I think the unspoken assumption of like the liberal notion that uh, suffering is righteousness, in the political sense, the reason that that black Americans have been like at the forefront of the general move towards social progres in this country, is because they cannot sell anybody out, because there's nobody that they can uh... could deal with power to get a worse deal than them in exchange for them getting slightly better conditions. they're at the bottom of the totem pool. now over time you get uh structures within the the black community that reward people at the top and create like a compridor situation. somebody's talking about Jim Clyburn, and yes, he's essentially a compardor for the internal colony in black America, but in general like the black political tradition has uh is disabused of a lot of... the ideological mystifications of uh of other communities because uh what is screened away in those communities, the inherent oppressiveness of political institutions uh is revealed or that it's screend to them by the fact that they don't suffer the worst of it, that there's some sort of wage, skin wage, social wage that is a uh inducement to accepting some element of America's ideology, which isn't something that that uh has been open to the majority of of blacks since the end of slavery. uh, and so well the 15th amendment was not all it could have been, uh, it was still a hugely forward, because even a few years earlier, as we've talked about on the... stream, the idea of uh enfranchising uh black Americans, men, but uh, any black Americans, was absolutely unthinkable anywhere in the country, and the fifth amendment uh made black enfranchisement national policy, so that does speak to the fluidity of the moment and the real possibility for uh, for things to have been pushed further, but the reality was that uh without a commitment to challenge the entrenched uh planter class and their refusal to accept black political subjectivity, it just wasn't going to be enough. uh, and it wasn't helped by the fact that as I said, southern Republicans in DC, uh, didn't have really any influence in Congress, they could, there was nothing that they could wheel or deal about, because they were coming from uh, a part of the country that was economically stagnant, all of the all of the incredible amount of uh, economic uh expansion. that's i'm going to talk about for the next chapter, all of it was happening in the west and in the north, the south was completely stagnant during that period, no capital was coming into the south relative to what was going to the west and north, so that means there and that match with the fact that the local, the power and the money that did exist in the south was all oriented around the planter classes and the democratic party, meaning that there was no structure for campaign donations, and and and uh party in infrastructure funded by local uh political elites which you had in the north meant that there was no money for them to uh come north to spread around uh they were at the mercy of a republican national republican party that was kind of sick of the whole thing uh and and one of the reasons was because these guys were increasingly, the the the northern republicans were increasingly orienting around capitalism and uh and economic development as their agenda and away from uh black rights a lot of more and more they were feeling like this we fought the war to end slavery slavery is over to have the vote now let's make let's get this bread uh and and their liberal fixation including their mania for private property and a limited government to prevent that private property from being uh being messed with, led them to some of them to actually resist things like the enforcement acts and the clan act that allowed for the suppression of some of the most horrific violence in the south, but my man Benjamin butler said to these idiots, if the federal government cannot pass laws to protect the rights, liberties and lives of the citizens of united states in the states, why were guarantees of those fundamental rights put in the constitution at all? and he was able to get the clan act passed and the enforcement acts over the complaints of these northern liberals, and it had an effect, it it brought down the level of violence. so that's chapter nine. all right, so chapter 10 moves north, we've been in the south this whole time, now chapter 10 says, hey, well this was all happening in the south, what's been going on in the north part of the war, and what has been going on is you is that the economy is exploding thanks to this railroad, this crooked railroad-based economic investment scheme, um, there's a huge boom in railroads, mining, lumber, manufacturing, and more importantly than the fact that these things are expanding, they are consolid like these uh, in mining for example, for for most of the mid-19th century, the mission of a minor was like a, you know, a prospector, going and finding a hole, digging it, digging it when he wanted to, stopping when he wanted to, controlling the conditions of his labor, by the early 1870s, most of those people had either stop mining or been bought out and been replaced. by large corporate mine interests, paying wage laborers to go deep underground, uh, if anybody has seen Deadwood, the whole arc of George Hurst coming to town and buying all the claims and bringing in cornish laborers, that that's that's the process we're seeing in the south, even the land, which was the dream of Westward expansion, yoman freedom in land owning, even the land in many parts of the west was being consolidated under the ownership of a few big uh uh owners. California is the perfect example of this uh California is one of the most agriculturally rich areas of the country and even in the 1870s it was already coming under the... control of a handful of families and that never win away, California agriculture has been controlled by a cartel of of agricultural families uh ever since and the thing that's doing this is eastern money, money from New York, money from uh Europe, coming to invest in railroads, invest in mining, invest in cattle as we talked about with the... with the Richard White Book and to invest in uh lumber uh and while these companies are buying out their competitors and and increasing their share, they are facilitating that by just also buying the fuck out of the entire political structure. Republicans, democrats, everybody is getting in on in the forms of outright bribes, in the form of retainers, there was a senator Rymond Trumble from Illinoy uh who was on retainer well in the... senate from a railroad company, which was at the time legal, uh, and even more than that, just the distribution of stock to stock in railroad companies to politic politicians, would then vote to give land to that very railroad company, absolute self-dealing, uh, and we talked about how this kind of uh corruption undermined the uh, the reputations of the... reconstruction radical governments, but whatever was happening in the south was dwarf by what was happening in the rest of the country, because there was more money, by from 1862 to 1872, 100 million acres of land in the United States were just given to railroads and a number of x slaves pointed out pretty actly, how the hell are those guys, what did they do to earn that land? where you're telling us that we can't. given land because that would be wrong, that would violate social private property rights, that would buse buse we haven't earned it, we have to learn how to, you have to learn to work, even though they literally had worked the land their entire goddamn lives and had every bit of their fucking labor taken from them, but it's because money, the railroads were going to build create jobs, the railroads were looking to the future uh black land ownership, which was going to be subsistence land ownership, was not going to be the kind of productive, large-scale agricultural output that they were looking for was not uh, was not productive, uh, but the republicans while they were doing this in the north were also extending the state building project that was happening in the south also north elsewhere also. these governments were starting to build much more public school and hospital and infrastructure and uh that had existed before, but all of that meant taxes went up very much, which also pissed people off, and also all of the corruption pissed people off too. uh, one of the more perfect uh, stories about the way that the liberal middle class reacted to uh to the scandal of railroad uh corruption uh and this is also in the Richard White book and Forer talks about it too uh because it's very just very perfectly emblematic of not just the the time but the the the function of like middle class moral moralism in sort of uh manufacturing consent and and reinforcing capitalist rule so in Massachusetts which was home the it had been the center of abolitionism it was the center of liberal republicanism and and that middle-class tradition of of property rights uh and horrible fear and distain at Irish immigrants who were filling up Boston like crazy uh those Massachusetts reformers who had the the state on lock at that point uh they decided that they were going to fix railroad corruption not by regulating the railroads which would have been an intervention in the the private sector but by creating a uh a expert panel to to see over the railroad uh contracts and to compile information about them and it was led by a prominent uh blue blood and literal descendant of presidents uh Charles Franciss Adams Jr. who over the course of his tenure at the top of it turned the organization into a uh captured instrument of the railroads and in fact elected uh uh technocrat by the way, why is everybody talking about fucking world war 2 in the chat? i just noticed everyone's talking about is what people playing axis and allies, what's going on? this is about whether they should have dropped they dropped the bomb, what's going on here? or if the soviets could have taken Japan? "We're not going to let the Soviets take Japan, that was not going to happen, we nuked them to stop that from happening. So in the middle of this, the working class is for the first time in American history, coming into coherence as a political force, but it is very much divided by geography, ethnicity, language, conditions of work, some places like Pittsburg at this point, are still uh, places where workers really have conditions of labor that are closer to an artisan uh uh whereas in other places like New York City you have uh like the creation of real like you know 19th what you think of when you think of those dark satanic mills Massachusetts too of course uh and so that thing those things all like make it difficult for them to articulate a coherent politics but there are certain political issues that come out of uh labor organizing: one is uh greenbacks, the uh notion of replacing gold backs, gold species as America's uh uh currency uh peg with just printing money, fiot currency, and of course it's very interesting to see read these 19 century uh conservatives freaking out about uh fiat about the very notion of fiat currency. when now most people take fiot currency, even conservatives take fiant currency as sort of you know necessary, of course there's a lot of libertarian types to fixate on the gold standard or bitcoin, but if you're in power, you kind of under assume that this is there's no real alternative to fiat, uh, and but what's different between the fiat that we have now and the fiat that uh that was being proposed by these early uh working class political movements, is that we have the federal reserve now, we have a fake structure of impartiality to control the money supply outside of democratic control. what the greenback's movement was was, hey, how about we decide collectively how much money there is, which was of course absolutely anathema to uh wall street, to the fucking bank of England, which was at this point sort of in the same position in the global trade nexus that like the uh IMF and stuff has now uh the the civil war really did open it it it flayed the skin the ideological flesh off of the notion of money and revealed the bone like before there was this fantasy about what money was before the civil war and then when the civil war happened and they just printed a bunch of money and people took it and it worked it really did and show that yeah, no, money is, money is valuable to the degree that the uh, that the body issuing it has some sort of uh claim of authority where it's being uh exchanged uh, and these these liberal conserv, these republicans, these procapital republicans were desperately, desperately interested in closing up that would, which is why at this period, you're seeing, even though you're seeing this huge economic. expansion, there's a deflationary pressure, because the government is in the process of calling in greenbacks and applying a gold standard, it took years, it took until the mid 1870s, i think to actually get to a gold standard, because there have been so much money putting out through the civil war that had to be kind of pulled back in um uh, but not like all at once because for one thing working people were like, no more fucking money please, uh, but the other big uh issue. was the eight-hour day, which was becoming sinaquinon with freedom. if you, if you could not be a yoman, if you if the dream of of of total property autonomy was was dying for a lot of these people, if you had to work, then you should work a reasonable amount eight hours to work, eight hours to rest, eight hours of what we will uh, and that led to a movement in congress to uh limit federal employees to eight hours, which passed over the objection of a bunch of these liberal republicans. who thought that was uh an a horrible intervention in in the uh in the free market uh black workers of course were largely cut out of the uh labor movement. due to racism uh and and due to the their perception is threats and also the fact that there weren't that many black laborers in the north, the black people made up at this point less than 2% of the northern population uh and black laborers in the south obviously were dealing with their own situation and were still largely agricultural uh but the where black workers did organize they did kind of naturally end up being a little more conciliatory towards capital because there was no uh solidarity extended uh there's a story that founder repeats about uh a massive strike by uh white stevadors in Baltimore to get black shipyard workers off of the docks and led to the firing over of a thousand of them uh and then a local white merchant helping a group of uh black uh stevadors get access to their own shipyard so there was an idea that well if we're not getting any help from the worker class Maybe we can get some help from well-intentioned capitalists and of course the idea of well-intentioned capitalist that's a fraud, but it's a fraud that is propagated by things like race uh hatred as a wedge that defeats working class solidarity. So the labor movement caused a huge amount of cognitive dissonance in lot of republicans who had been committed to ending slavery, in part because they thought that if they ended slavery that they would basically solve the labor problem in America, that the labor, the labor uh, the only labor problem in the United States was the existence of slavery, and that if we did have a nation where everybody was equal in the market and was able on the market to equally sell their labor. and their goods and exchange, that that would be essentially the the state of nature, because that was very much the underlining, the underlying ideological fantasy of liberalism is that there is such a thing as an economic state of nature, and that the economic state of nature is free market exchange, and that the government is essentially perverting the... world, perverting the earth, violating sacred laws by intervening in the market. In fact, one of the big arguments uh that the liberal republicans made against Greenbacks was that uh repudiating goldback debt was a dishonorable, and that denying the intrinsic value of gold was unnatural. These guys all thought they were the... in the universe, but like this is all stuff that falls apart on the merest examination, it's all tautology, but if everybody is jacking themselves off with the same tautology, and that tautology keeps you at the top of an economic pecking order, it keeps you from having to get your hands dirty, it's more powerful than any idea, which is why history is not made by ideas, ideas come later, ideas ratify a state of affair. and ratify the hierarchy within it, because no one will ever adhere to an idea, or at least no critical mass of people in power will adhere to an idea that undermines their position of power, because the only thing they really believe in is the power they hold, the only thing they really believe in is not having to work for the money they have, because "ho would, who would want to? nobody wants to work. so this the fact that you have these white laborers saying, hey, this sucks, uh, we're being exploited, we're we're we're actually slaves in a way, it fucked with the their heads of these republicans, it it it caused them to have to confront a lot of their priors and uh, what they did to solve that problem, that that crisis of ideology was to just." stop thinking ideologically uh and this led to the and this is part of the process that leads to the end of the ideological era of the republican party when it was organized around the principles which it was from it's founding in 1852 i believe until like probably you could say 1868 uh and it becomes a organizational party like uh exactly the way that van burren's democracy. into uh, you start with a attempt to advance a ideological position through a party structure, but once that party takes power, once that party embeds itself in power structures, and creates parasitic relationships with power, the way the republican party did with the emerging uh corporate interest of the time, uh, it no longer needs its ideological motivation, it is able to motivate people to vote for it, to uh to fill its ranks through uh its organizational enticements uh in the form of uh patronage, jobs for people all throw out the... of government uh and more importantly for the point of view of the party than the patronage is the kickbacks, because 19th century spoil system work like this: the party gets in power, whichever one it is, you're a vanburn democrat, you're you're a uh, you're one of rosco conklings republicans in new york uh and you're a good republican, you're friends with like your local olderman, he gets you a job as a postal worker, you are expected. to kick somewhere between 10 to 20% of your salary to the republican party. now you might also have to pay the guy who got you the job, but that's between you two, the the party depends upon this circulation of money back into its coffers, and this led to the creation of a segment within the republican party called the stalwarts, who didn't give a shit about how corrupt all of this was. because they were looking after the power of the Republican Party, now for many of them like Rosco Conkling and James Blaane, it was largely self-serving, these guys were political entrepreneurs, but Butler was also uh a stalwart, and even though Butler I don't think is in any way a principled person uh, when he was uh military governor of New Orleans, he confiscated uh cot he he basically made up a uh a pretense to confiscate all the cotton coming in and out of New Orleans and then auctioned it uh at very low prices to his brother who was one of his adjudants uh but he was also interested in the the the uh the spoil system because it gave the Republican Party power and he actually wanted that power to be put in the service of uh sending freedom to uh ex slaves and also to uh the laboring classes of the north, and the thing that they these stalwarts, the way that the starworts got people to vote for uh republicans was the ones who waren't just benefiting from the patronage, was not necessarily through ideology as it was through resentment, the civil war just happened, it killed 300,000 northerners, the people who killed them were basically all democrats, the democrats were still the other party in America, you could do well in most northern states that sent thousands and thousands of boys south to fight the war by saying vote for us, the other guys literally shot your brother, they called it waving the bloody shirt, and it worked, I'm not voting for the party that literally killed one of my relatives. and while they were doing this uh they were also uh attaching themselves remoral like to this emerging corporate uh capital structure uh demanding kickbacks to the party itself, not just to the individual members of the party at every level of economic transaction uh which kept them detacked. from any specific interest and answerable only to themselves, but still dependent upon these capitalist structures in order to to fund their uh their actions and this this situation, this corrupt confluence, which led to the creation of a bunch of political machines, especially in cities like philadelphia that were essentially identical to the old Tamani Hall machine New York only with republicans instead of democrats. Why are you talking about PMC again? Why is everyone talking about PMC? You should be talking about PMC because we're leading to the revolt of the PMC from within the Republican Party. And that is the rise of the'. the people who are like the closest thing we would have to that kind of class in the 19th century when capitalism is still in a protein state uh attempting to draw the line of social progress at emancipation and civic equality because they were seeing the these these middle class reforming types protestant merchant class the people who had been the engines of abolition uh they were seeing that there were two that the dr that the anti-slavery cause ideologically had like two strands to it, one strand was a recognition, it was it was a recognition of human equality, it said slavery is wrong because we are all people and it is wrong for people to be uh deprived of liberty, but there is another side, the other the other side of that, which was motivating them just as much, because remember this is the merchant core, and if not merchants, all of the people who lived around the merchants, like all these intellectuals and academics and reformers, they all lived around finance capital, even if they were not directly involved in it, their their livelihoods depended on finance capital. that other strand said that slavery needed to be abolished uh because it interfered with market efficiency. because uh, it was a feudal uh remnant, it was a backwards approach to the economic management, that what what the future was was liberal subjectivity, universalized liberal subjectivity, and once the war ends, and the project of building America's capitalist structures becomes much more. or central, in large part because the war itself creates a bunch of capital, war is always the thing that sparks in capitalist development in countries. the second industrial revolution in England was a direct result of the napoleonic war. America's industrial efflorescence was predicated on the the civil war in the same way. So with that is the new focus. of of these this merchant class that universalizing that that that that ethical uh argument kind of lost its purchase because there's no more technical slavery everything else oh there you know black people are still being killed and and and whipped and and oppressed in the south sure but they have the vote it's up to them to fix it it's up to them to get their money everybody's equal in the market and what and uh what? these people wanted uh was to stop reconstruction or at least let it stop uh pushing forward on it uh getting rid of the tariff and imposing free trade instituting civil service reform so that you couldn't have the spoil system for distributing patronage uh and replacing elected officials with appointed experts and the guys the guy these guys hated more than anybody in to fight the civil war uh the things that uh John Brown envisioned when he was trying to end slavery and that was uh a actual expansion of politics to everybody, it was, if we are a democracy, that means it is government by the people, not as the liberals thought, government by the best and most refined people, just so happen coincidentally, not only are they the most refined, they are also the people who are on top of all the fucking money, so not only was Ben butler a uh in very much in favor of vigorous suppression of the clan in the south and uh and the support of black whites from the federal level, he was in favor of irish independence, he was in favor of women's sufferage, he was in favor of labor reform and greenbacks. also, i should point this out, as i said earlier, wildly crooked, he was a spoilsman through and through, he was not, i don't think you could say a good person by any in any kind of existential sense, he was somebody who through the course of his career was pushed in direction that led him to find uh value. in this, you could and that was really the argument these guys made is that a guy like Butler is a demagogue because he's just using the poor to try to get power for himself uh, but even if that's true, the politics that he proposed uh, it meant taking seriously the challenge of slavery and and of the war to defeat slavery, which was to recognize. the essential conflict being between classes, and that the war against the planters necessitated, morally and politically, a continued war against private property as it currently existed in the United States, so the way liberals dealt with this conflict, the problem of reconstruction, the problem that, hey, we uh, we get. slavery, we created civic equality, we created equality in the market, and black people in the south are still very fucked. uh, what's the what's the deal here? there's two things you can take from that, you can say, well, it's because uh, it's because the market is not independent of power and politics, there is no natural order, uh, you actually have to build and maintain political order, and until now in American history, we have had a private property regime, a fan of yoman autonomy that was predicated on there being a class of workers who did the most intense, the most brutal labor, the most extractive labor who were not part of the political body, and the existence of those people allowed for the creation of some sort of classless fantasy, that's what Calhoon imagined, and once you end that, once you bring this proscribed class into the political spectrum, into the political world, you have fundamentally changed the political, what politics is, you have necessitated the transformation of the state and the abolition of the constitutional order in my opinion, and change the relationship between people and government, people and political power and economic power uh towards socialism, the other answer you could say is uh, actually they were inferior the whole time, which is what most of the liberal republicans went with, liberal republicans looked at the wreckage of reconstruction, the failure of reconstruction by that point said, this is because the blacks just weren't up for it, even though the conditions that doomed reconstruction were the conditions imposed by their prescribed nostrums, not redistributing land, not dispossessing the clanters, not freely distributing greenback currency, not abolishing uh small holder dead, not doing the things that would have allowed for uh racist ass white southerners to go, you know what, i don't really like black people, but hey, the war ended and now i have more land and i'm not in hack to some fucking asshole in a castle, you know maybe i don't fucking care so much about this shit uh No, no, no, it was their inherent inferiority, oops, and so uh, the liberal Republicans split off from the Republican Party, and in 18 uh 72 uh, did an independent uh convention in Cincinnati, uh, and this was filled with all of the most sterling liberal lights of the time, uh, and also all of the Republican officeholders. 'who had lost out in uh party internal battles for power, basically it was sore losers and nerds, it was everybody who got boxed out of the uh the the victorious machine in the state they were from and uh these fucking scribbling dickheads who were fixated on the ideological purity of liberalism and they nominated Horus Greely for president who was a had been a a crusading abolitionist newspaper writer and and hater of democrats uh but who after the war had decided that any attempt to impose equality on the south would have been a violation of natural rights and and and and property rights and all the sacred things that make up the American the incoherent and idiotic American creed of liberty and so uh even though he was pro-tariff and the... liberals were were wildly against the tariff uh he ended up becoming the figure that the liberals could coale around the one they could all agree on and then the democrats who at this point uh because of disenfranchisement of confederates in the south uh were in a situation where it was hard to conceive of them winning an election by themselves uh also nominated uh Benjamin uh Horice Greeley and because there was no coherence at the top of the ticket, the only real consistent issue they ran on was ending reconstruction. and grant ran on the bloody shirt and continuing the fight to uh for equality and he got he won uh grant won 55% of the vote which was one of the biggest uh landslides of the 19th century, it was such a bad ass kicking that Horis Greeley actually died like three weeks after the election uh and what it really shows is that even at that point even if at the top of the Republican party which... is being totally dissolved by uh spoils on the one hand and liberal orthodoxy on the other uh there is still an appetite for the war to have meant something for for the struggle and for the sacrifice to have had a meaning that transcended the mundane of politics and uh it speaks more than anything to me to the potential that lay dormant in that moment and that we that was law uh, not for the reasons that the duning school assholes talked about, of course, but also not even for the reasons that like liberal uh, sort of tragedists would say, a lot of just bad bad roles of the dice, sometimes you play DND and you get a bad role, but I think the fecundity of the moment, more than anything speaks to the fecundity of every moment, that no matter how hopeless things seem in the moment, that there's always a chance to push through and figures like like the existence of a guy like Benjamin Butler and his trajectory of his career, I mean he was a guy who he made his money in the civil war by uh by selling flower to the army who leveraged his relationship with a local bank into getting a commission uh who was by any stretch is much of a self-seeking entrepreneurial scumbag as you'll find in uh 19th century American politics, but because of the pinballing randomness of life and his the encounters that he had over the course of the war, he found himself in a situation where he was the national spokesman for a road not taken, and the fact that it wasn't taken, i don't know, it to me means that it could have Okay, so next week, we're going to wrap it up, last two chapters uh, and then I think we'll take a little break, I'm not going to stop doing the Wednesday stream, but I might not have a book for a couple weeks just to like do some other reading I need to do, uh, but we will get might be black reconstruction, although I might take a break from reconstruction right now, I will do black reconstruction, I promise it, I just might not. do it next just because it's a lot of reconstruction uh maybe cleanse the palette with something uh maybe do a uh something about maybe the German revolution I don't know so what were you guys talking about this world war two? Oh, we're the Americans useless in Europe in World War II. I mean, I wouldn't say useless, I think the thing about like the Germans winning, the Russians winning it, like obviously, but I mean they were sure got their asses kicked there for a while. I mean, if there's a situation where the United States isn't the industrial dynamo it is, because it was the industrial capacity. of the United States that beat the Germans more than their military involvement in the war, that did it. Grant was very much an Isenhower figure. Isenhower, Grant and Washington are all, I would say in the same basket of presidents and that they are figures who emerge from a war, a a a conflict, a a distribution of the status quo to validate the new uh status quo, and and whose whoose um whose symbolic role as like deliverer of... victory allows them to uh subsume all of the contradictions of that moment into themselves and sublimate them, which means that they are all kind of by definition reactionary figures, but like in a relative sense, you know, like Grant, like I've said, uh, did a lot more than the liberal Republicans wanted him to do, but uh, was not. um uh was still a reaction to radical republicanism and a desire to see it not ascend anymore and the same way Isenhower even though he you know he validated the the new deal consensus from the republican side was a uh suppression both of like at that point the uh sort of uh I guess declining radicalism of the new deal, because by 52, thanks to uh, the second red scare and the taft heartly act, uh, the the radical edge of the new deal is is very much guttering out by that point, but also of the sort of resurgent right populist, the the the taft wing the republican party, the the ring that is now the whole of the party uh, who were neutralized by the kabal of wall street uh financiers who foisted Isenhower on the convention, which is literally what he did, and just like Washington, Washington was an avatar of American liberty, but then in power he validated the federalist uh concentration of uh capital and the the uh the alienation of rights away from the states and away from the land into uh Into money. Yeah, RIP Peter Seleepen, reformer without results, he was definitely a reformer, but no results for Peter Steliepen, merked at the Accra, and the last thing I want to say, and this is something that I said in one of the white streams, I think talking about the liberal republicans and this liberal uh, movement here that takes over. that it becomes the center mass of politics historically anyway, and it's very important to note that the liberal republicans and the people they represented were always a very small percentage of the population, they had no real ability to uh control events, as you can see by the fact that all they could do is get a doufis old editor was dying nominated, got his ass kicked, but they were influential in retrospect and influent. uh off of the scenes because they were they were the the the the articulation of the culture, these are the people who wrote about stuff, these were the people wrote all of the good press that we look through to understand the past, so they structured the culture, even though they were not necessarily in control of it, and they are, even though their ideology is now the ideology of the... right wing uh, the people are, the class itself is still around, and they over the course of the 19th century went from being having this like reactionary, politics of hard money and uh lazy fair economics, by the turn of the century, these are als these this type of person, it's different people, they're people who have grown into it, they're they're younger people. displaced those older people are progressive, because by that point they could no longer sustain the illusions of the liberal republicans, because capitalism by that... point had definitively failed to provide what the liberals had insisted it would uh and so they decided that a a more interventionist model was necessary and that's where progressivism comes from, but the fundamental reality is that they can never truly challenge capitalism because of their embeddedness within it, and now we have a situation where you got this PMC that people freak out about, and they do have that same class position. but the the difference between the historical iterations of these people and the current moment is that there is no uh working class for them to bamboozle or undermine, we're all in essentially the same class position in this country in that we do not have any class awareness, we don't operate from class consciousness. It was coming into being in the 19th century, it came into fruition during the new deal era, and then it started to decay in the 60s and 70s and and it's been finally over the last 40 years abolished, because you got to remember, every cycle brings new people, like not, not new classes necessarily, not new relationships and and proximities to capital, but doesn't care about the culture that you're trying to preserve, it only cares about surplus value, and the extraction of surplus value over time is a series of traumas that deform and reduce and undermine every structure of of meaning within a society and leave it uh atomized. and and miserable, even and no one will who is exercising the will of this thing can stop it because they don't know that's what they're doing, and that's that is what ideology does, ideology takes all the bad feelings that accumulate from being part of a extractive, exploitative, isolating economic system and creates a culture that validates them, one way or the other. and right now we're in the situation we are with like the polarization and the uh the uh epistemic bubbles because we have finally achieved a situation uh we have reestablished a situation rather that existed before the civil war where uh you have two poles of capital that generate their own cultural frameworks that are totally separate the the the land-based extractive capital culture of mega and the coastal finance capital of the Democrats. I did see the thing about uh tenent, that was pretty funny although apparently like it was not in 2000, it was in 2006. I don't know, I don't know that much about it. I don't try to get into the 911 thing cuuse I would go insane. My opinion of the people in the Bush administ. would be no different if I found out they did 911 or not all right folks uh well friday we'll do another chill out, I don't know if I'm gonna do, I don't know if uh Chris will be free to to game, but if he isn't I'll still uh just hang out and take questions. Hi folks.
