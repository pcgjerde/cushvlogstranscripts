 The festival was over and the boys were opening for a fall, the camera was quiet, except for the drilling on the wall, the curf you had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down anyone with any san since had already left town, he's standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hers, backstage Molly is playing five cards stood by the stairs, lily had to queen, she was hoping for a third to measure. another deck and drew up the jack of hearts, big gym was no one's fool, he rooned the town's only diamond mine, he made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine, outside the streets were filling up with his time and mine and silver cane and every walking place, he took whatever he wanted to and he left. all the waste, but it's diamond mines and silver cane and no match for the jack of hearts. hi folks, so tomorrow we're going to do uh the chapters four through six of uh the black Jacobns, which is a cracking read, i hope everyone's enjoying it, it's a lot, it goes down smooth doesn't it? uh talking about the uh the rise of the slave rebellion uh and also the rise of tussen uh who uh James is making a case as one of like history's great historic figures uh which I would agree with and uh I really do think that James does a great job of contextualizing like the romantic appeal and and sort of the... sense of like the man of history, the great men, like there is something that is narratively soothing and and uh engaging about the imagining history as uh actions of uh embodied selfs and therefore concentrated the forms of like these great figures and therefore and that they have a uh they have a role their individual will is able to count more than other people's in a fundamental way, you know, the consent of all and the actions of all make up a social corpus, but some people get to make more important decisions than others, and uh, then when history starts cracking open and crisis emerge, they throw up figures who would otherwise have lane dormant through the social strata, and like one of the great tragedies of capitalism is that it as it overwhelms uh all of life and destroys initiative, destroys the capacity for human initiative, for human action to actually effect a change. capitalism and technology literally strips humans at every level of our autonomy, and that means at the top too, the feudal lords of Europe did not want capitalism to emerge, they acceded to it in the... exigent need to compete with each other for resources and power in the closed socio-economic system or the the closed uh the closed order, the west failing order of European states, and we're literally stripped of our ability to affect the world around us, now we don't accept that fully, that's what ideology is there for, that's what our superstructure is for, the culture we uh uh live in inverts all values and takes all that's bad and turns it good and gives us an explanation for why things why we have less power why are we're not able to do what our uh what our forbarers have been able to do why we couldn't turn the wheel and they had some explanations that they carried with them but there's a fundamental sort of uh dimming of one's connection and eventually you become overtly aware that you're not in control of anything anymore and then you are defeated. then you are made into a slave and it destroys your belief in the system sufficient for you to motivate yourself yourself morally and intellectually and energetically. like you you are not able to fix yourself with with any uh investment behind a position and then you are you are literally disenchanted from the system and that is where we find ourselves where everyone at every level has been stripped of autonomy but these these jobs still exist, they're still filled with people, we're still here, we're still here, we're filling the same roles, but with less uh belief in them that. motivation than ever, and that is the crisis of Americans social fabric, it's why people cannot do anything other than the most selfish thing, because they are fundamentally unable to engage with each other in anything other than uh the the marketized relationships that have been enforced upon us by technology and time and capital accumulation. No, you can't go come down too hard on the romantics, there that was a necessary response, and like they provided necessary uh friction, I mean it wasn't all great obviously, but you can't blame it, it is a humane response to dehumanization, it could, yes, it turns into things like fascism and and uh and nationalism, uh, it has to, that heat has to go somewhere because capitalism is in control. uh, but no, that the tragedy of our age is that it is easy romantic, there is no romance, there is no sense that you can affect anything, but there is no belief in anything but theself in its most narrow construction, as a as an agent of economic uh inputs, yummies and yuckkies, that is what we have become. and now we're trying to make sense of a world where we are supposed to fulfill these social roles that had historically encoded with them uh a rituals of affirm affirmation of belief in a system, affirmation of belief in something beyond the self, that's something that was worth worth um honoring that goes away, because if you're not building anything that matters. "if you're not actually responsible for anything, and that's another big part of this, this is highly underrated is that one of the reasons that the system does such horrible things to people is not the the other side of the equation of these decisions being made by the algorithm, what that means is that the people associated with these decisions who have to execute them as a moral question, have to make the choice, they are making a choice to execute, and even if they and yes you can say, but they could resign, somebody else will do it, yes, but everybody has to make a moral choice and the fact that there's somebody else who will do it means we can avoid responsibility for doing it and i will implicate myself entirely in this is this is not nobody gets to choose out of this this is like the duning cruger effect this is universally applicable if i don't participate in this machinery of death someone else will therefore my... involvement in the system is superfluous, and that means i don't have any responsibility for what the system does, so that means that i can benefit from an unjust arrangement without ever feeling like i'm an exploiter, because the system will go on, and we all know the system will go on regardless of what happens to me, and that feeling is associated traditionally with like being high in the hierarchy where you feel like you actually can control something, the idea that if i didn't do... this it wouldn't happen, you need to have that sense that something else can happen to make it a real moral question for yourself, like because we're all going to be averse from self- sacrifice, if we don't have connections other, which we don't, we have had them stripped off of us, we can only believe in ourselves and our pleasure, so then we participate in these systems and we get sorted really demographicly and by chance into slots in this machinery, and then we are asked to make choices and the fact that choices aren't real, allows us more indulgence to do the wrong thing, and now we have a system where the logic of capitalism, the algorithm of capitalism drives everyone to doing the wrong thing, drives everyone to universal uh immorality, because responsibility has been taken from them, because responsibility has been taken from them, and that is not anyone's fault to feel that, it's real, it really will. keep going if you don't stop, because remember the dream of a general strike or a mass uprising is a coordinated one and we can visualize those, we cannot live in a world where those things are possible, we live in an era that has killed those... possibilities, the same way the 19th century people killed God, we killed the capacity of there to be an overwhelming spiritual overlordship of the individual self, no, then there was the hope that there was a a species consciousness, which is God in another name, they could envelop the self and integrate it, and nope, the answer is no, that's how what, that's what we come to understand the world to be when we observe it. so we cannot imagine acting uh universally, we can only act independently, and so our independent refusal to do something will by definition not change it, so why don't we just get the benefit rather than somebody who's a jerk? i mean, virtue mongering on the liberal on liberalism, liberal virtue mongering boils down to the fact that these people are accepting hierarchy, accepting perpetuating hierarchy and have rationalized to themselves that they deserve it more than others. morally, that's that's because these people are the that's the lingering sense of internet connection uh to other people that that that exists in the residue of the death of uh of the search for a species consciousness uh that's that's just our guilt our sense of guilt our not any sense of love connection our sense of guilt which is mediated by that big other that dominates us and it was God. and it was then the possibility of a class-based humane revolution, uh, synthesizing of capital to the needs of all, uh, that feeling that was associated with that is gone, and what was left is liberal guilt, the conscience, the the the self projected outward, the other. that must exist to observe us and to make our uh individual identity uh uh coherent. it was God, it was the race maybe this the human race. nope, now it is just the self because of the domination of capitalism and it's dehumanizing effects, literally dehumanizing effects. and so we're all from. trying to live in this world, how do we make choices that we can really strip to their essentials, because we're all going to make compromises, everybody reading this, everybody listening this, reading this, everybody listening or watching this, including myself, everybody participating in politics at this level, is of course participating in capitalism in a way, but to greater and less degrees of individual importance, which means greater or less degrees of leverage the... could be utilized if it was expressed outward in solidarity and not individually, but that requires staying in the system enough to, you can't if you can't quit a job because because of the company that you work for, and keep the connections to the other workers, you have to make a and and you need jobs to live, we need to work to live in this system, at least for now, we'll see if they fulfill the UBI or we can just be pure consumers. which honestly might be what ends up happening to those of us on one side of the of when the when the final walls go up when when the when the uh laser motes and the drone uh perimeters go up if you're on the good side if you're on the lucky side of that you'll probably see a a UBI where where ac uh where livelihood is at a certain degree uh detached from labor so that everybody can consume even though our labor is is uh totally because of in the because of at the end of the hyper exploitation at the at the inside technology uh our labor is superfluous to the system now we can just be the consumers because our consumption is what drives it our consumption is what keeps the wheel moving so as long so it's a perpetual motion machine of of greed of individual desire colated by the price signal there was an actual article by some fucking demonic christians about how the price signal is proof of God's design, this perfect system for distributing uh understanding of this, this is their idea of the human mind, a demonic, selfish, self-consciousness devoted entirely to self pleasure, the the vision of all seven deadly sins cohered into a will, that's their idea of God's will, the fucking price signal, they're literal demon worshipers. but for now you got to have a job and then what what job is it going to be? what obligations you have to other people? all these negotiations you make about what to do in every decision that you make, even though you take many of them for granted, as I do, as we all do, and so our challenge in life really, and in this thing is to strip moments to the to the bear, and then evaluate what were, where our chain of interests really lie, and the thing is we can't do that logically, you need to be honing in on other people, hoaning in on other frequencies to collaborate, instincts, because when making decisions you are battling your own body sensations which are independent of what you think is happening, and that is where you get feelings, feelings are the undigested and unrationalized first like pass of stimuli from the outside that is what you do to make up the world, but it is not at some point there is an inflection of self. and - our hearts and minds are symbols and the feelings that are generate our symbols into one another and then harmonizing them and creating symbols that that transcend rationality and they convey truth, they convey truth of human connection, of of the systemic nature of the universe, of our integration, our fundamental integration into a a cosmic fabric that means that our notions of like self-interest that we we carry with us from our genes, are fucking illusory, are illusory, it is a fundamental misapprehension of the universe that is caused by that cap in perception from a feeling to to the ability to express feeling, which makes up civilization that we then live it, that builds this black iron demirgical cage that we are trapped in, and then we can only echo locate against one another. and we are all therefore obligated in every moment to be present enough in our decision, in our bodies, in the in the time of crisis, that we are harmonizing our feelings to the words we're using to express uh what we really want to do, because we're always as rational beings at the end of history, we're always rational consumers, we're always looking for our best interests defined. delusionally as some sort of uh individual interest, a pursuit of pleasure that is by definition, illusory, a pleasure that is never attained, this is the important thing, the the rational pursuit of pleasure is irrational, because pleasure can only ever be pursued, is basic Buddhism, lacan talks about it in in continent philosophical terms, it's to my mind it is undeniable. never seen anybody argue that this is incorrect. desire cannot be fulfilled, so a society based on desire of the individual will never run up against any uh natural boundary, will dissolve it in the pursuit of this thing, unless our desires are tethered, if the thing we desire can be uh can be pursued, because we're going to desire things, if the thing we desire can be pursued, say it's a communion with all, like actual communion, a sensed communion with the with all, the a sharing of the high mind, now we can't have that in life, you can have moments of it, but they are forgotten as soon as they occur because they cannot be symbolized, but and that is why we are always struggling to understand our own feelings and our own relationship to to the divine and ourselves is because we don't know. uh where these things come from, we're just guessing, but that can be pursued uh beneficially because all that energy that drive towards the desire that is motivating you, why? it can go towards building something, it can go towards building a thing that involves the uh thriving of other people whose conditioned you care about as much as you care about your own condition, that can drop that that that is uh everybody moving in the same direction in a way that does not require a state, this is what marks talks about when he talks about the withering away of the state, the state is there to enforce transactions and interactions. conception is that if you get a situation of post scarcity, remember, this is post scarcity, this is we have accumulated enough capital to work technologically our will on the world with minimal human labor input, which we have absolutely reached by now, the industrial revolution and then the technological revolution that came after or the the uh the silicon uh information revolution that came after it have given us the tools to do this. and they've given us the cultural tools uh to to comprehend a notion of like uh collective identity, and if we all believed in each other the way we believe in ourselves, in a social context where we're born into no real danger of precarity, never really feeling threat from outside, never having those spiky adrenaline fighter flight relationships established a young age, we never get that. because for the, I mean, of course, we don't get none of it, but it is, it is absorbed into an otherwise uh, calm universe of humanity, which is allowed because technology is doing all the really bad work, and the remaining alienating work, the remaining unfun stuff is shared, or if there is some sort of division in time, it is paid for in time, like you got to do... there's shitty work to do somebody does it one four hour, it's like a volunteer shift, because enough people because there's enough technological uh uh carrying out of the system, what is left, there's way more people than there are jobs, there's way more people than there are jobs, so you rotate people through the jobs at low levels of commitment, well most of the rest of the work is done uh technologically, if you get to that point, the coersions of the state. will be unnecessary, you will have return to civilization, the pre-historic um police force of mutual consent, you will have, you didn't have, there was no cops, no formal police force, no formal state in a hunter gatherer band, because if you didn't do what was good for the group, you were censored culturally one way or another away from that action. over the course of your life, because people were paying attention, you were bouncing up against other people, you weren't just flying uh uh frictionlessly through a plane of consumer capitalism where all this technology is destroying the world around you and hyper exploiting people all around you without you being able to invest yourself at all, and in that context, all of the mechanisms of state coersion become superfluous, the state withers away, and as Marks said you the final state is a formula, a social formula instead of being towards capitalism towards profit from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs, meaning what people need they get, and the thing is, you can't, the reason people don't get that when they're trying to conceive outside of marxism, why it's so seems counteritive and wrong to like libertarians to say, well that means that all the lazy people just sit around. social order, instead of people living in a communal social order, there will, everything you need will be provided, because the need can be socially filled, the need and the capitalism can never be filled, and so you have to have a hierarchy, there has to be a, if I'm smart, "i have to, there's got to be something in it for me to participate in society to give you my labor, to give you my smarts, i have to know that i'm gonna get something, and sure, it starts as stability, but then it becomes uh, i want a boat, i want two boats, i want two houses, and look at these other rich people who are getting even more, i want more of what they have, and that cannot be extinguished, that fire once once, it has to be uh transformed." and so that fundamental uh fact of of the of the inate suffering that comes with life, the unquenchableness of human desire as the engine of human action, shows that that action is either being channeled towards humane ends, because it is, it is, it is a definition of self, it is a definition of desire that is socially. either in the direct sensual form one way or another or the pleasure. of relative ease and comfort compared to others, the the uh the ben the uh sensation of hierarchical uh elevation over others, the fundamental idea that I am higher than other people, because if I'm seeking uh life to be only pursuit of individual pleasure, then I have to define myself individually, and that means I have to hierarchize myself, and I have to ask myself, do I deserve this power, do I deserve this position so I can feel safe in it? That's also a sensational pleasure, liberal masechism is a sensational pleasure of capitalism, and all of us are operating out of one or another of those to the degree that we are captured spiritually by these ideas, how have we translated our feelings in our lives, and so the challenge that we all have to face is, how do we change fundamentally, how do we fuse our notion of desire, our our labidnal energies to a felt emotional connection to others that transcends the barrier of the liberal subject, that is the that's the engine of of meaningful revolutionary action, and I have to say, many people either don't get to this point because they're stuck in liberal pieties of and ideological blind spots, or even if they think of themselves as like rigorously marxist, they get to this point and then they lose heart. I say, you know what, I can understand the logic here, but this is this doesn't feel like the world I live in or can live in. I would argue there is a counter example of this, and of course it's not fucking perfect, it's not fantasy, what it is is it shows that the market is not the ultimate solvent in all context with humans now, that there are humans now who can coordinate actions, and of course you could say it happens everywhere and every day, yes, and our lives are peppered with humane action generated by a... felt connection others, it's just it's we don't feel it enough, it's too, it's not, there are places that you that show that given a social context that encourages it, you can create this, and I would say the example now is yes, Cuba, the fact that Cuba survived the fall of the Soviet Union to me proves, proves that between 1959 and 1989, Cuban communists. did something, built a system that then was turned into a mass political organization that put into place structures of power, uh and democratic control of economic uh forcess and distribution of labor and alienation through the system in such a... way that when the time came, when the crack of doom came and the and the and the subsidy from the soviets dried up under the most immense pressure imaginable, pressure that broke uh regimes that were much uh more uh economically viable and much less close to the United States and its wrath and much less uh attacked by capitalism and isolated from capitalism uh it didn't fucking fall. and the thing is we would have if they had done it through violence, if they had cracked down on like this collective revolt of a desire for freedom that you saw in like the eastern block, it would have been a fucking blood bath, it would have been Tieneman square on a country wide scale, and the same way that neoliberalism was installed in China at the point of a at the barrel of a gun in a country that thought it that by that point was trying to build socialist uh relationships. Meanwhile in Cuba they kept communism without massacring everybody. Did they use violence? Did they use state authority? Of course, they put people in prison, the the most the most the most alienated people left and went to the United States, they have a high prison rate in Cuba, relatively high uh, and not just political prisoners, just they have like they have a lot of common criminals, wh they put in prison because it's a very fucking poor country. but there is a degree of social uh of day-to-day social enchantment, day-to-day social um consent, absent the uh machinery of the state that keeps people working together, and it's under attack and it might be destroyed, we've been trying to destroy it for 60 fucking years, but if conditions this is what i mean when i say this is possible, if you if conditions in Cuba got better in the sense that they got like brought into supply chains, but not into capitalist. supply chains, they were brought into a socialist supply chain, the way that the Russians thought they were going to get hooked up by the Germans after their revolution that never happened, if if China if Cuba got hooked up to a conveyor belt of like economic development from outside that system that was not predicated on on neoliberalism, that they would turn into uh the closest thing to like a scandinavian fantasy social democracy without the uh inherent racism that is born to being in the colonial center, like general multicultural, the real synthesis, the thing marks said would happen, the thing that it now feels like a fantasy, it is in my mind, the germ of it is in Cuba, and for my mind, and to me anybody who says I'm wrong on this, explain how communism didn't fall after the fall of the Soviet Union when you see what. and in every other fucking communist country and you see places that did way more to crack down on public uh violence and emigration that fell, even Vietnam who fucking shed their fucking life blood and did build like a genuine spreed a core out of the nationalist fight went neoliberal. They made the choice to to to give up the long the idea of of of a people being motivated by something beyond selfishness and the thing that and I and and maybe the reason for that is because the United States didn't scrangle them so much like you could obviously you could honestly argue that the fact that the United States uh embargoed Cuba is with save the revolution, it was the fucking fist that made the diamond. now that doesn't mean at this point that we don't need to get in the fucking uh embargo, because it's literally they're getting to an exfixiation point. and uh, you know, the thing about Vietnam is you can say, well, they weren't as embargoed as as uh uh Cuba was, which means that they they were more engaged in the market anyway, even before they went neoliberal and therefore they had established relationships and then like a way as a short-term mechanism of of and the other thing is is when you're when you're Vietnam, if China fucking neoliberalizes you basically have to, because China and Vietnam, historic enemies uh, it was so hilarious how... the domino theory which presid resided over American uh uh cold war policy in Asia goes into uh is what uh says that it's supposed to lead to the communization of entire Asia meanwhile a year two years after the vietnamese um the north vietnamese take south vietnam they invade they invade Cambodia and then China invades Vietnam. and so no matter what you want to do with Vietnam, if China is is going to liberalize, you have to liberalize, because you are still in a conflict, because those both of those communist movements were based in a nationalist movement, and the nationalism in my opinion sort of transcends the communism over time, as as as the the system asphixiates uh under the the capitalist global system that's so... strangled communis everywhere, and it was the reemergence of of a potential conflict, a competition with China, if China was going to develop faster, and everyone by by this point knew the capitalism, whatever else it will do will help you develop faster, because it will alienate all of the violence of the system into the market and therefore give create a system where people are uh consenting to their own destruction because they'... abbregated responsibility, so the world system cranks everything out and it pops off, and there was no resistance, the Vietnamese acceded to it, because there was no more belief, there was no more real belief or not enough, never. not more or less, it's never, it's never binary, it's always gradations, there's always fellow feeling, there's always transcendent understanding of the self, in every government, in every system, in every social uh relationship, but it is to greater or less degrees felt, to greater or less degrees is symbolized in the mind and given uh as a name to the feelings we have, and maybe the fact that cuba didn't have that, cuba didn't have that uh was a nationalist project, or I guess you could say that the nationalist, the nationalist stage of the cuban, in the initial bourgeois cuban revolution, which was the rebellion against Spain had extinguished itself, had exhausted its capacity to enchant over the course of the Machado and Batista dictatorships. Meanwhile, the communist movements that took power in Vietnam and in China were part of a overall nationalist struggle. The nationalist phase had already been extinguished in in Cuba. The people who have dominated Cubans on the island had been cuban for the entire 20th century by 1950, by the 1950s. The... that there was some nation that they could serve, that they should be serving, it didn't have any kind of emotional weight by that point. meanwhile, service to the nation was a fundamental driver of both Chinese communism and vietnamese communism, and post colonial communism is all throughout the the third world, and that meant that decision making becomes immeshed with a national concern. and so when the time comes to make those decisions, what do we do about the market, what do we do about the the western wolf banging on our door? they they choose to uh to unleash the virus, to unleash the pathogen that's going to dissolve the social fabric that has undergirded their entire project. communist, nationalist, it's all going to fall before international capitals, dissolving grey go fucking uh, singularity size, stripping human agency out of human relationships, replacing them with the machinery of an algorithm of of profit extraction based on desire. what's wrong with the audio? God damn it man, these fucking people, oh the fan, oh I'm sorry, shit. sorry, it's whatever, my favorite thing people say on the internet, it's whatever, it's united my, it's my united states of whatever, is what it is, it was my united states of whatever, still sounds like a robot, well i don't know what to do, i don't know what to do, i hope it, i hope it, you can hear it because i feel like i'm making some strong points. so if you want to ask yourself like well why do i why do i commit to this why do i commit to this belief this new belief that there is a there is a frequency that there is a homing there's a homing device in all of us pulling us together that we can hear if we turn it up loud enough because the world is organized to dim that it is organized to make us only here the most the most selfish and self-destructive. uh siren desire, the carnality, and I don't just, like I said, I don't just mean lust, I mean all selfish desire to uh, that is not connected to like a greater good, and that is also going to always be there, like I said, that's not going anywhere, I mean we're not going to all be boos, if we were we could all just close hands, our eyes and we would literally transcend, we would, we would wink out the universe in a moment, if we could do that, we are, we are though, we're regular people, we're still driven by desire, but what desire for what? Desire for what? That is why we must all put ourselves in positions to act meaningfully from a awareness of that homing signal signal. because if we do that at key enough points in our lives and key enough decisions, we can start driving the truck, because we can start cooperating, cooperating, which is what the only thing that defines anything meaningful, nobody has politics, nobody is a political actor to the degree, unless they're acting, this is not acting, this is this is also contributing to our self indulgence, but if you can imagine our degree of technological sophistication and the social order that at key points is dominated by people acting from a felt spiritual connection to the species as a whole. you could move things in a direction that yes you would still have oppression, you would still have violence, you would still have conflict as as the the various forms of domination that have been inscribed by the malforming effects of capitalism are resist, but you will have a movement in a direction away from catastrophy, but what would make that happen, it's not those people change. their opinions, it's not everybody having a thing and then acting once, it's people every day coming together to move the fucking thing, to believing in the thing enough to move it, and the reason to talk about something like cuba is just to give another form to our rational symbolic. understanding that we need to have to keep thinking this way, because this is all about convincing yourself, this is all about hypnotizing yourself, it is about putting on that they live glasses, and I got to say if Cuba does go the way of Vietnam, if somebody smarter than Biden does decide that the way to smother the revolution is to just turn on the fucking charm and turn on the money hoses, they might, I think over time they would win, if there's no other um resistance outside the system, or if if the system doesn't collapse, without without some other, I need somebody else from Cuba to fucking stand up. and resist this thing, it would be, but look at how long it took, look at how long it would have took, compared to everybody else, I think I've understood uh fundamentally a just deeply important um like fundamental counian incommenserability between two intellectual factions of the left, I mean I don't think the left exists, but there are people who engage in leftist intellectual discourse, it's all online, it's all monetized, it's all parasocial, it's it's very great. but it really is our cafe scene in like uh revolutionary France, that's sad, but it's true, times change things, technology changes things more than anything, and there are people who all use the same words that mean different things by them, like marxist or socialist or left, all these things, people are arguing over definitions. they genuinely don't think the thing means the same thing, but they cannot convey the difference in words, it's a deeper connection that transcends the logic of their position, and i would say that... lot of friction within the left online is predicated on one big fault in the United States, let me say the US left, people trying to understand how to do leftism in America, there are those think that the constitution of the United States represents a transcendent value system generated by the people made the country, a... transcendent positive schematic for human relations or you think it was the product of emergent land and uh trade-based bourgeois just finding a political sanctification for the rule in a context of common land ownership rather than feudal. and ownership of free real estate rather than feudal uh feudal divisions where where the where the peasants could not get the land because land was power so you can't give the peasants land because that that what are you there for here land is distributed relatively freely to any white settler so power concentrated differently and they created a system to concentrate it to give democratic sent to Aristocratic rule, to tell the hords, have them walk around all day thinking that they were participating in these decisions, that they were making decisions, they get to go through the system and think that they're doing their best interests, in fact they're inscribing the power of an emergent capitalist class, they don't notice it first because they're getting the free real estate, they're getting to be their own bomb. they're getting to be their own little baron and so they acceed to it and over time that the form of that deal changes once the land runs out it becomes what you can do in the stock market you can get a small business and you can get a home after world war 2 it's you can get a home you're you're a fucking wage slave now you sell your labor you are alienated from your ability to reproduce your fucking life you're at someone else's will but hey you got a house that means some degree of investment in the system and independent of power, even though you're you've been cut off from the land, you didn't notice though, you didn't notice you got cut off from the land, and I do think that that might seem like a pedantic point, but I really think that if you see a lot of the arguments between people who seem like they should be on the rights, the same side and are arguing about a lot of the times about definitions of things because remember this is all abstract, nobody speaking from experience, this is all hypothetical, this is all is as a hot dog a sandwich because nobody has the direct experience of anything, is that the difference ways that people see different issues boils down to, do they think that the constitution represents anything other than class rule? now there are other divisions that fraction off within. those divisions, but I think that is one of the most fundamental, and I honestly think a lot of people call themselves marxists, if they got it put to them black clearly would be like, oh fuck, yeah, you know what I do, and it's like, I'm sorry, I don't say, well, the thing is, I don't know, you're not a marxist, I don't care about that, I don't think it's true, my my, the way I understand. history built on a bunch of different intellectual foundations, one of them i think marxism tells me that that's not how it works, so i don't care if it's if it's socialism or not, i don't care if it's populism or progressivism or whatever the fuck, i don't think it's true, now that doesn't that doesn't imply necessarily that i'm going to be like, well i'm going to say fuck the constitution and fuck America and i'm going to piss on the flag all the time, no because most people do think the constitution fucking. something, that's one of the transcendent triumphs of America's fucking propaganda structure and political superstructure was getting people to believe that shit by bribing them, it is that bribe that mean that is the residue now in people who say yeah, the system is fucked, rich people are in charge of it, and it's all uh class, we need a class, working class people to come together, but along the constitutional grounds. they have missed it and you don't get at them though from saying you're wrong, that is where i that's why i say so much of online disputation is harmful people trying to make these points through debate, all you're doing is solidifying sides, because you're not arguing about the real distinction, and even if you came at it like that, you're not going to argue them out of their belief that the constitution is meaningful, because it's deeper than a argument, it's deaper than rationality, it's deaper than reason, because America has a national had a nationalist movement and had a meaningful impact. Yes, Marx did support the American revolution as a fundamental development of capitalism, correct, but it was that's what that, but what that means in practice is that it makes a bourgeois government, which is bourjois class rule, unlike in Europe is able to gain a greater degree of public asedancy to that among the important classes, the white people close to positions of power, the white people on the hands, whose hands were on the machinery building the country. and will buy them off enough to solidify it, and generations of people prosper, first is yoman, then as pioneers, all of this at the expense of black labor and and and Indian land, obviously that's that's the whole thing of capitalism, it puts all the externalities off the balance sheet, and one of the ways it does that is by having these people within the bubble who think the thing works a way that it doesn't, who have seen in their own lives, the system work, because it's designed to work for them, of course they think it works, and so then when things start breaking down as they are worse and worse, because the system is breaking down, the ability to give those treats, the ability to make people think the system is working is wearing away, and people are asking, what's the deal? and then you get responses and if you start for the premise of, well the constitution is good, therefore these guys are against the constitution, who is for the constitution? republicans are for the constitution. These are deeply welded things, they might get disillusion from the Republican Party, but that's deeper than the Republican Party in their estimation. Republican Party, they supported as a vessel for their deeper national fusion of the notion of their best interests, the constitutional order, the patriotic regime of the United States, the identity of an American. but once again this doesn't mean you can just argue people out of thinking the constitution is good or saying i don't like the constitution or fuck the first amendment because this is deeper than those arguments, you can't argue them out of that. what has to happen is struggle at the level of labor at self-interest where the root of my life, this thing isn't paying off for me. because it is in the root of the experience that you that other people who have a different understanding can say, hey, i am in the same six experience, look at my experience, look at where i have put my finger of blame, and then watch if enough people come together, this is how fucking unions are formed, i'm just describing class consciousness formation, it is a comparing of notes in the experience of fucking misery, and so all we can do as consumers, producers of political media is treat it as the entertainment it is and only take from it a greater will and desire to apply meaningful action in our lives day to day. i would love to join a union but that would be a fucking joke. what i like i said, i'm a fucking artisan, i don't know, and i'm sorry, any union i would join would be like what? uh, podcasters? i don't know, somebody wants to one whatever and the thing about this like fundamental uh what I like anyway about this like takeaway from all this stuff is as an action call is that it does the least amount of harm if you're wrong because if you do this what happens and and and oh no I should have been online one you'll never know. you'll never know if you were wrong, it's only in your head, and two, you are going to find yourself waiting for moments to act, and being driven by a desire to help, that is going to be hard to overwhelm because, this is the important part, you have withdrawn your libido from this spectacle, you have stopped imagining yourself to be an actor within a political struggle. you have castrated yourself before you've gone online, you put your dick and balls or your vagina in a jar and you went online to entertain yourself, the same way and you did not... tell yourself that you're being a uh, that you're being a political actor, but if you say, I'm going to participate in all this stuff, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make these, I'm going to have these arguments all day and I'm going to fixate on these things, the these hot dog sandwich arguments, uh, if you're wrong about that, if you're right about that, you'll never know. because everything's just going to keep getting worse probably, and if there is anybody who fights against it, you're not going to be there, because you're going to have convinced yourself that anything that actually happens isn't good enough, because you'll be too scared to of being wrong to invest in anything, because in the process of engaging in this battle of ideas, you will have invested yourself in these hierarchies sufficiently to fear more than anything falling, have the precarious paralysis of the fascist working class or fascist middle class and crisis, so every actual eruption of meaningful uh uh action will be uh you will scoff at it, critique it, maybe support it, but only from a far because you don't want to be wrong, mad projection, i'm describing myself, what are you talking about, i'm not projecting. when i say, i guess when i say you, i just should assume i mean me, as i'm still doing this, i'm not any way politically acting, and the thing is, i feel that, i feel that i'm not politically acting, and so that sensation and my association of that feeling with that thought, it changes the way i interact with the world, changes my uh, it changes my decision matrix, but here's the other thing is that if I did do stuff outside of it, I'd still do this, because I do this for reasons other than a sense of I'm doing things politically. This is for me something that has its own reward, but participating in this shit like at the level of of content consumption of of consuming the arguments, the arguments that that make up the new cycle, that is that is eating cheetos for dinner and you got to, you just have to feel like it, and if you if you hook up your dick to this thing, if you hook your genitals up to this thing, it won't feel like it, it'll feel like a delicious, nutritious meal a balanced breakfast until your teeth fall out and the question of what to do is predicted. by your skills, your interests and your position, your fixed position in space time, what is what your social conditions are, and of course your entire suite of illusory individuating personality traids and traumas conscious and unconscious and desires, but i i you think you fuse, you fuse the, you bring together the two halves of your mind, because the... the body mind duality is is, it is a perceived thing, but it is a perceived separation that hides the fact that it's it's one being, the mind and body are the same thing, mind is the body and vice versa, but there is this line between the two, that is my opinion, generated by the literal distance. between the exterior of the body and the central sensational trans processing area. and that like the transcendent state we see, what we imagine, the mystics imagine what we hope happens after you die, and what is just what is always there, but is not perceived is of that being one thing, and then that one thing being connected to the other thing of the fucking universe, but there is a there is a screen, there is a fucking dividing there that is defined by the... physical distance it takes for sensation to be felt, and that is consciousness, that is assigning symbols to feelings without a direct line to where those feelings came from, and we move through life trying to negotiate that uh barrier try trying to tear the veil of maya and you can do it, you can feel that, but it requires conditions of will and and concentration uh, and and emotional palet and and self-restraint that are only possible in certain conditions, and we the strive, I think is the strive. to create the conditions where those feelings can be experienced the most frequent and we're traversing that barrier and trying to will our way to action with incomplete information is what it is, because at the end of the day we're guessing, at the end of the day we are leaping into a void, every single decision, every single decision on what is around us is a leap into the void because we don't really know what we're experiencing and our consciousness is shrinking its perception even further in order to make it easier to sort everything like we're less perceivers than windows down of information as a as a body we can perceive vastly more than our brains take in consciously to make up our world hear more smell more. but it would be too much, we have to differentiate, and those differentiations are made arbitrarily in the mind, and the thing is, we know that, we have to paper over that awareness, we have to leave beyond our ability to describe what is going on, which is what our symbolic after current of accumulated consciousness is. It's not, it is, it is arbitrary to our consciousness, there are reasons for every decision, every decision at every point has a reason for it, but we aren't aware of them. We can't pin them down, and if we can't pin them down, we cannot follow to a a a uh, we cannot get a feedback loop that is perfect, there is a signal, there's a noise that accumulates in the signal over the over the gap, yes, of course it's a part of the the physical state, this these things, these decisions are being made by the body, not by the mind, the body and mind, there is no distinction, like you're thinking mind, you're thinking this thing, there is something below that that is still mind, it's just separated by distance from the gathering point, the're saying it's not arbitrary, this is the... This is the difficulty of talking about this stuff, because in the sense that there is a cause and effect going all the way through, yes, obviously it's not arbitrary, but to the point that their mind must make a choice from within a veil of ignorance, is also true, so that means it is arbitrary. people are arguing about a damn robot in the chat, what you fucking nerds? You guys are fucking nerds, all right, whatever, fuck you, fuck all y'all, I ain't scared of you, I don't care that I ceased making sense, I realize I'm getting to the point where I can't just explain myself anymore because I see it my head, but I don't necessarily have the words, it's very frustrating, all right, bye.
