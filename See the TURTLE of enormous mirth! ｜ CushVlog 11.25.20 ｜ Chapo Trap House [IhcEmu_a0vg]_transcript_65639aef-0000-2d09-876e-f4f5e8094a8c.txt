 Baby, here I am, I'm a man on the scene, I can't get you what you want, but you got to come home with me. I love you better than him, that ain't nothing but 10. I'm sure the man gets around down. i i man on your scene, i can give you what you want, getting back into chocolate milks, loyal viewers of the flix vlogs will remember that i went through a chocolate milk phase at the beginning of quarantine and now i am back where i started, it really is delicious, i have to say it, the chocolate melts with the milk, creates essentious uh truly indulgent combination of uh flavor and texture. Okay, I wasn't going to mention it, but babies are not workers. Why are people mad at that? Kids can't work. The only way you make money in our capitalist system is through wage relationships, if you're not an owner, so kids can't work, so that means the more kids you have and you the job. jobs pay per person, so if you get wages as an as a parent or as two parents, the more kids you have, the farther spread the money is among mouths and therefore the more the inequality exists, how is this a thing to be controversial? how can you get mad at that unless you have like everybody online confused uh moral arguments with empirical questions, like they hear this, they're non workers and they think oh my god he's saying bad, he's saying that they're parasites, no, he's saying that they can't contribute to the labor market and get money on the labor market, which is the only place you can get money if you don't have capital, and so therefore the more families you, more, the bigger your family is, the hard, the more inequality will be between you, and somebody who has the same job and makes the same pay, but has fewer kids, and the only reason, the only thing this may any of this makes sense is if people are hostile to the idea of people having children, they'... think we should not be encouraging it, through all their leftism, what they really are is a eugenesis progressive who wants to make sure that people don't irreresponsibly overbreed, as if that's the real problem we're dealing with in this fucking country, but anyway, won't say anything more about it because it's a dumb twitter argument, if people don't know what i'm talking about, that's good, it's some bullshit people have been yelling about maddy b stats, my boy matt bruding, look the man has the args, you do not have the args, but people yelling at the thing that makes me most annoyed about it is everyone who's trying to yell at Matting knows less than he does about what they're talking about who are they are because and they half the arguments are made up and misunderstandings of the of the point for that very reason they literally don't understand what he's saying because they're too dumb but they they decide they're going to take them on fools fools and the thing is is that like the people who the closest thing to a real coherent critique of it is, it's not actually the labor market that it crosses inequality, it's capitalism. okay, no shit, that's not what he's interested in. mat, matty B's entire idea as like his contribution to the public good is that i am very good at the args and the numbers, that means my job should be to create policy ideas, that presupposes the existing political structure that we live within, that presupposes capitalism because we're not getting rid of it right away, there's nothing to be done about capitalism right now, but as brought of a browder left project, having policies to talk about and push for in the in the reality of the world we live in, that that's it's not any less valuable than anything else anybody's doing on the political spectrum, let's just say that, it's certainly not undermining any like greater. energy, it's providing a service, now you can say it's useless, you can make an argument that there's no point at this point in the decline of capitalism to even be uh humoring the notions that we can do any kind of systemic reform to this thing, there's no reforming this as people like to say, and to that I say, okay, fine, but then don't get mad at Matt Broning, because he doesn't agree, and he's not operating from those principles, you are essentially yelling at stratovereus because he doesn't make pianos, he is, he does, he does wonkery, therefore he presposes that you can do some sort of change to capitalism that could move it in the direction of... and make people's lives better at the same time, if you say that project is dead, you might be right, I might be persuaded, but that is nothing to do with what he is saying, and getting mad at him is stupid, and it's about positioning yourself as somehow smarter or more informed or more right or more good or more virtuous than him in the marketplace of ideas and personalities that's online. and it's because everybody's a fucking idealist, everybody is an anarchist at the end of the day, no matter what your tendency is, if you've really invested the discourse with meaning in your life, you're an anarchist, you believe that it's all about phase shifting reality, through persuading people, because how else could you explain using all that time and energy to make arguments on the internet, unless you really think if enough people hear you, you can convince them to change their beliefs, which will somehow change their action. as though their beliefs are not the byproduct of what they have to do to survive or where they find themselves in the in the hierarchy of precarity within neoliberalism as if that's not what generates their ideology. i'm not i am, i mean i'm projecting in that i'm describing what i'm doing too, yes, but i've also accepted that and part of my what i talk about is an to break me and people listening away from the cycle and using examples of how if you don't do that you end up wasting your very life, you're not even having the fun you, you're not even having the most fun version of of diverting yourself, there are more fun ways to get your rocks off than this, there are more, there are less uh, there are ways that do less to like tighten you up into a ball of anxiety, the way that obsessing about online politics does, their ways to get off that get you all off like actually relieve and and out end in orgasm instead of this like agonized edging that is what political ideology uh as subculture amounts to like go to David Buster's for christ sake virtual David busters my vibes are good I feel good I feel pretty good lately feel like I'm in a good place. I think part of it is because finally understanding the scope and structure of what I want to put down on paper, which I really feel like I have to do at some point to justify keep doing these, because it is indulgent to do this, like this is easier than like a harder, but maybe more meaningful attempt to express myself could be, uh, but as long as I feel like I'm doing them with a a real near term goal in mind, uh, they they're very fulfilling, so I feel good. but other parts of my life also, i think not coincidentally, going better, going well, because it's just i'm better able to deal with everything around me, including stressful stuff, that means i appreciate the good stuff more, it's good, and of course a lot of that, 99.9% of that is not me, it's not my mindset, it's my absolutely privileged condition, i'm in a little ball, i'm i'm tucked way, I'm, I'm genuinely not affected by this slow-motion catastrophe of living in America, it gives me the freedom to work out my stuff and feel and and like you, address my relationship to you know my indulgent artistic pursuit of a career, whatever you want to call it, uh, and that's you, that really is, I think why I understand people. people who do turn into the gay states communism fantasy because they imagine like people who feel are relatively precited within the structure but also feel a sense of guilt and participation in exploitation because they do participate in exploitation and then they imagine well if everybody could have this we'd be okay but the problem is this is too bound up in your personal pleasure it's too bound up in consumption as lifestyle what this is is a atomized, despiritualized, socially dead existence that has to be sustained through the uh transference. of meaning onto objects and then the consumption of those objects, the physical plat using surplus to assuage existential anxiety through consumption is the engine of everyone's idea of what the good life is, even mine and my little bubble, being my little in my little artisan bubble, which of course is still connected to networks of exploitation that I participate in and benefit from, and I feel that same spike. and you want everybody to feel good like you, but if everybody felt good like you, it would be a nightmare, because it would require uh full automation and but it would end up with us being the wall people, because we would have no spiritual dry, it would be, it would be, it would it's it's dead, like that's the part of you know uh, like the conservative response to... uh to modernism, you know, like the the demister reactionary argument against the enlightenment and the french revolution is that you're losing a a a felt spiritual communal identity, a a a crucial part of life when you pull it pull human existence out of its social embeddedness, and the thing is they're right about that, but the problem is there's nothing you can do about it, that process is inevitable, we are driven, we are going as soon as we accumulated the capital surplus to create the cultural institutions that gave us permission to to hyper exploit the way capitalism did, the technology, both uh in terms of physical things like electricity, steam engine, whatever, metallergy, and then social technologies like the printing press and protestantism and uh and humanism or uh and the enlightenment, as soon as those, as soon as those tools exist in the hands of humans, they're going to use them, and and accumulating that surplus requires the these the the the uh eviction of people from the rural idiocy of small holding uh tenant farming into the urban environment of markets and exchange, that's where fucking surplus gets made, or that's where surplus gets. gets lived, it's gets taken from the country into these concentrated areas and that was going to pull us away from that social network no matter what, the question is how are we going to uh integrate that you know the the the ghost of that into the institutions we were creating, and we have had done a bad job so far, but I argue that if we do build any alternative, any uh class collaborative challenge to the existing paradigm, it will come. with a uh a spiritual dimension that will be infused throughout it structure whereby and it won't be religion, it will be a civic, it will be a civic translation of the old religious feelings, a modernized secularized spirituality that will emerge as a byproduct of and generator of class consciousness and class mobilization. but that's why you that's why uh it's why we have to work together because it's far too easy otherwise to convince yourself uh that the perpetuation of a status quo that sees you as a fat happy little sack of uh of dopamine is actually justice. I don't really have any thoughts about maridona, I'm not a soccer guy, he seem like a pimp, seem like an absolute pimp in a legend, the guy was doing bumps after uh, after scoring goals, king shit, cheated and then kind of admitted it uh in the world cup against, excuse me, the disgusting English, anybody who beats the English is a king of course and a hero. but not a huge uh huge soccer head, i'm not a football mate, i'm not actually a gooner, that's a bit when i say that, i'm not a goner, i'm not a bloody gooner mate, yeah dude's rock is definitely taken a taken it on the chin here with the death of maridona, he is a good dude's rock. icon, what is a, like, a Jock who embodies all of the most zesty, hedenistic cliches of these sporting life, combined with a you know, perhaps theatrical and perhaps indulgent, but still deeply felt left-wing religious sentiment, you don't see that too often, because it's not like you, yeah, yeah, like a lot of a lot of famous people have like fake politics just like a lot of non-famous people have fake politics, but he was like hanging out with fidel castro, that's pretty fucking cool, seems like another one of those type of people they don't make anymore, the edges have all. and smoothed off. somebody asked for a book recommendation on American history, which is kind of a hilariously wide topic, but uh, I would say that to cover a subject an area of time that's generally understudied by even like you know casual but serious uh American history hobbiists or or academics or something is the the antibelum period uh like the development of the of the first two party systems before the... a war and uh Shawn Willins who is an insufferable lib awful politics but a damn good historian uh which is you know true of a lot of people uh wrote a book called the rise of American Democracy from Jefferson to Lincoln which I think does an incredibly good job of laying out the dynamics between the two political the political factions that emerge out of the constitutional order uh he is very uh clearly pro democracy he's pro uh he's in favor of the Jackson turn he is essential premise is that once uh the two like factions factional uh of government like broke up the federalists and the anti-federalists uh what happened is is you saw a general correlation among the federalists and then later wigs with restrictions on the franchise in terms of uh like i uh voting uh poll taxes and uh you know uh uh land ownership requirements uh age limits, things like that, um, and the Jeffersonian and then jacksonian party was favorite expanding the franchise uh, and that boiled down to uh the fact, and and and and Willins is right that you know the democratic urge, like if that we're going to assign a progressive value to the America's democratic notions of one person, one vote, that we now sort of take a sacrasant, then that drive, even if it was at the behest of a party that was essentially made up of a... at that point uh drunk uh award healing crooks in uh in the cities and drunk Indian scalping uh scotch irish psychopaths in the countryside but they were the people and what they wanted expansion what they wanted land what they wanted the ability to get some to be have no man be their master was the democratic impulse and the federalist slash wigs who wanted us to hey how about we slow down and build a a little bit so we can compete in this new like global uh politic uh this global trade system that we find themselves ourselves in and this like alliance system like we are now part of like an emerging global world system an economic world system we have to participate in that we're not going to be able to fuck around in our little sandboxes we need to fucking have an actual coherent government power that can compete at the global stage but the people understood that were people who were at the heart of commerce in cities like New York and Boston and they were out in the countryside, which is where the the people were breeding like rabbits and more were coming in every day, and so these people who had the best interest i would argue of the the United States as a political project even in addition, yes like were they looking to exploit labor, absolutely, did they want to financialize the economy and like bring people under a yoke of like economic compulsion? yes, but that's government, the only reason that feels like a fucking uh some sort of norman yoke. is because we're operating under the delusional notion of individual liberty that can only be persist in the fake uh eternal expanse of America where everyone has operating off the assumption of land is being infinite, can you imagine that you could be ungoverned because you can be subsistent, you can live in a current world, you can interact socially, you don't have to go back to precivilization, you could be civilized, but you cannot be compelled, because you can always grow your own fucking stuff. to do anything with that, to you know buy more, to uh improve your land, to uh, to acquire the fruits of. plus like the finished goods that you can only get by trading with cities, any of that requires cooperation that does involve a a alienation of authority to a third party to adjudicate these uh exchanges, you have to give up some liberty, and because there were so many people who had an interest in just expansion in its own right, southern slavocrats southern slavocrats who made up the intellectual backbone of this movement by the way, they were all southern slave. Who made up the the the intellectual heavyweights by the Jefferson expression of this political reality? um, demanded this end was expansion, but without any ability to hook any of this together, internally improve, create canals, create networks, uh, create a national debt, reduce tariffs between areas, so you don't have to pay fucking uh 15 cents every time you go across a state line with your uh bunch of pelts or whatever the fuck and that's the two-party system, it's the super ego and the id with the ego being like the overall project of capital accumulation in North America, and that's the party structure, and so at that point the democratic impulse which we now which we now post working class as the rising of the working class and then the arising of racial uh and gender you know uh resist. since to those hierarchies, now the democratic experience in our minds is connected to uh this virtuous sort of you know on the left we'd say like a working class socialist demand for for you know freedom and liberty for everybody meaning a freedom from and a freedom to, but that was not the original conception of American freedom, it has been turned into that i should say like proletarian like closest saying like mass little guy you know because we all imagine that we're like to make unfettered fortunes, and so Willins is sympathetic to the democrats, like hey, this is the democratic impulse, but there's also... called what half god rought by a Daniel Haw that covers the same period uh but from the point of view essentially like as a as a uh partisan of the Wigs and saying that all the stuff that these hillbilly wanted required the creation of these institutions and the thing is that's the way like the reason that this is a dialectical process is because these two things need each other, these two things are inextricably linked, but the nature of their the social relationships of the people who live in these in this system, the fact that people who understand the need for trade and the need for... strong government and the need for organs of state, live in cities all concentrated together, sipping tea with one another, and the people who think that the next thing, the only thing to do is grab the next uh acre of land you can find, are all just running off into the countryside and just larger in number and only like aggregate through their votes and have no other understanding of a desire other than just personal advancement of their family unit, their ability to pile up, that means they have to fight each other. though they need each other, and in the fighting you create a new thing, and the fighting led to eventually the whole thing blowing up because the sharpening of the contradictions and the civil war, which should have, like I said, and maybe could have without Lincoln dying, boggered in a a a a a self-conscious like, I wouldn't say working class, but like protoprolitarian alliance between ex slaves, actually the mobilized yowenry and working class of the north in the form of the union army uh and the republican party against the and and hopefully the uh the small holding and poor white population of the south could be could have united to essentially instead of making a uh a treaty, which is essentially what happened, like the United States over the decades of the reconstruction worked out a peace treaty with the southern slavocracy, the terms of which were all right, no more slavery, but racial cast system and compelled labor through uh share cropping and uh convict leasing that is equivalent to slavery, and then they spit their finger and they made the deal, that was the real end of the civil war, it was the treaty ended with with the real was not an apomatics, it was uh the uh, it was the 1877 uh uh agreement to allow rutherford hays and the republicans to... hold the white house even though Samueln had won the popular and probably electoral vote in exchange for ending reconstruction. that was the real end of the civil war, and the reason it ended on those terms is because any capacity to create that coalition was destroyed by Johnson essentially by immediately re by immediately reimposing in power the former confederate army and the former confederate state apparatus and its ruling class, if they had been surrounded, they would have fought back, like it wouldn't have been, they wouldn't have went meakly, the reconstruction still would have been violent, but the fight would have been essentially a continuation of the civil war, which had ended with the north in of dominant position, and with this new coalition of forces would have been sufficient to finally win a actual unconditional surrender like the... from US Grant demanded at Donaldson, and then you could have initiated a new conception of liberty, a new conception of democratic freedom and built a structure, a governing structure around that presumption, not maintain this fucking news, this this this chain around our neck of the constitution, which is predicated on this notion of unfettered individual, rulership, literal ownership, not just of land, of course, but of people. and the labor of people through direct dominion. people say won the war, lost the peace, i think that's i don't know, maybe the better way to think about it is is that the war didn't end until the end of reconstruction, like they had a peace treaty and then they negotiated the settlement, like the treaty of west failure took years, you don't say the thing ended until the treaty was signed. and the turning point was the Lincoln assassination. hard to get around that opinion, hard to get around that in my mind, that that really is like an America history, because you look back at what we have, and it's like, yeah, we really never had a chance, did we? all this land drove us insane, all this land is what drove us insane, and all this land is what meant that absent Lincoln, we were bound to do what we did, absent Lincoln, it was over. they were going to recapitalize the south, reconstruct the planter economy, which required essential, required compelled labor because it was labor intensive. the thing that ended slavery in the south like the condition of slavery was automation of agriculture. the thing that led to the great migration was the fact that in the 19s and 20s automation had caught up to the agricultural sector to this sent, it was much much less labor intensive to to get the crops that... uh that were able to be grown as staples in the south and that led to a huge reduction in the demand for rural agricultural labor, so black people move to the urban centers to become part of that army of industrial labor, that's how you create a working class, people move to this from the countryside to the cities for one reason or another, enclosure of some kind or technological change, but it's it's to me it's easy to imagine a way where if if the coalition of forces in power is different, that instead of reestablishing plantter agriculture, that the yoman model that had settled the north and that the the republicans had extended into the west with the homestead act during the war, saying go out there, grab some land and you stay there, it's yours, could have been extended southward, but the reason it didn't have to be is because it was able to be extended outward. We could always get more of that Yoman land out there, meaning there's no pressure for any kind of internal uh, that means that the ability to just keep the south is just this cashkaw persisted, instead of forcing the confrontation over the land, because if they because if yomanry had been extended through confiscation and distribution of former plantation land, the 40 acres in a mule, you would have broken up the system. the structure of uh of racial oppression that underlines southern life, even if you don't necessarily break up the the the habits, and the important thing is is if you extend this redistribution, redistribution of land to poor whites and you make the consequence of the civil war that their lives improve, then you change the dynamic of every relationship these people had. but also there's those engines, those infernal mills out in the east and they demand, they demand, they demand, they demand, they need fucking cotton. they need staples, they chew them up, spin them out, it's not that cold, it's not that cold, it's been a relatively warm november, i'll say that, we've heard it 60 a couple times, it's going to be 60 the rest of the week, i think, i think this is you know part of our new normal that we all love so much, don't we love it folks, we love it, we love it, it's so warm, i got to say though that given the fucking uh pandemic and the quarantine, i very much appreciated because you know i can only really see people outside and uh, i've been able to see them later than i thought i would be able to, because it was getting really cold couple weeks ago and i was like, damn it, i think i might have had my lastuh outdoor hang, no, i don't think so, i think there's a few left, free state of jones was very disappointing, i not when i saw it, when i it disappointed me essentially since i saw the trailer, i remember hearing the movie was going to be made and being excited about it because that's a very interesting story, but sadly uh the film itself even by the time it came out i was like oh this kind of looks like they fucked the dog and then i watched it and it fucked the dog uh mainly just because of how dreery it is like more than anything else more than any historical inaccuracy or anything it's just very uh dull is is just one of those boring righteous uh kind of gandhi like uh uh hero figures who is very very uh uh boring to watch because we're just supposed to observe and bask in his virtue like look at this good southern white man, which of course the fact that casts himself in that role, it really does speak to the lib need, the liberal need to be seen as good, that is like the presiding element of uh like our culture of liberalism, and this is why so many people hate it and think that it's some sort of cultural marxist conspiracy, it's just the incentive structure, if all if if if if if evil is inherent in our world, if we're fallen in the sense. that capitalism is real and cannot be changed, then the only uh reason that bad things and good things happen is because they're bad people and good people and it's about dividing them into those two groups and then one group kind of yelling at the other group, and so but part of that is establishing yourself as one of the good ones, and here's Matthew McConne literally playing a white southerner, who loves the confederate army in order to fight for uh uh black liberation and in a in a multiracial army, oh my god, this is awesome, you know, it's fancy, John Brown fills out a very similar character, like he's the fantasy of virtue, that the guy playing him is imagining he is, and the viewer who of course imagines himself as the protagonist, imagines that they are, this reminds me of the fact that Brad Pitt produced 12 years of slave, and he also has a role in it, if you've seen that movie, there's one scene where Brad Pitt pays a Canadian carpenter who comes to build a a barn on the land of Michael Fastman. uh planetation and fast bender is this monstrously awful slave owner and uh all pit does is give a little speech about how he thinks slavery is bad and then he smuggles the letter from solomon Northrupt home that gets them sprung out of slavery and he saves the day it's like i'm gonna we're going to make and it's hard to not think that he decided to make that movie to do that you know what i mean? Yeah, it's gonna be 60 on Friday, gonna go to the park, uh, enjoy it well, it lasts. Uh, I actually just rewatched a little bit of the John Adams uh TV series, and gimadi is great, but it is just a baffling decision, the fact that they it is, I mean it's like almost perverse, like the gimmick seems to be with John Adams, the... that well you guys know all the bullshit about the revolutionary war, you know all the cliche stuff right uh and what about the stuff that like fell through the the cracks what about the stuff that's like less remembered let's appreciate that and it's sort of this and honestly it's part of that like more than anything it's part of that uh cultural turn in the late 90s the David meccalla fucking Stephen Ambrose. dad history uh thing of looking back on America and like notting our heads, we notted our heads probably at two things, the founding fathers and the greatest generation, like from American revolution, the constitution, well done uh and also oh way way to go with that world war ii, just the smug selfratulation, and that meant there was a bunch of books about the founding fathers and guys like uh joe Ellis became household names on the best seller list, and McColler wrote this book about Adams and it really did seem to come down to we all the big stories, so what about one of the less known guys and that what that ends up being is that the documentary or not the documentary, the the series, it's six episodes and it's in one of them he's just like going to france during the revolutionary war to like just curtacy with some guys then there's a whole episode where he's the vice president and literally just sitting around and then uh you know he's got one episode as the president and then they have an entire episode that's just him getting old because one of the things about John Adams is he lived to be like 92 he died on the same day as Jefferson so they give him a whole a whole episode of him just getting decrepit. and it's like there it's it more than anything to me it says that the received wisdom we have about the the greatest the founding fathers like that dad history that wig dad history we were getting both from school and the culture about that it was so banal was so taken for granted that all they could think to do is just pad this shit out because like these are interesting questions about the founding of this country these figures did things that we live with that are interesting, and the insistence that the only lens to look through any of history is is through the personal, these are the great guys and gals who made our history, because it's a celebrity culture, these were the star, the all the stars are here, John Adams, button guinnet, george, Charles Pinkney. de witt clinton, elbridge Jerry and Ge smith in the Saturday night live b, so all they can do they can spend an episode on him, just his teeth falling out, because there's nothing else to talk about, it's like, yep, Hamilton said this, and then Jefferson said this, and wasn't it a battle of ideas, it's just vapid, but gi is very good, the episode where they debate. the constitution is pretty good, but that's always great, like 1776 is a fun movie to watch, because that's a really cool story, and you got the big big rousing speeches and everything and everyone's sweating and wearing wigs, but that's because we and and the first episode shows the early in his career moment when he defended the uh boston massacre British soldiers, and that was true because John Adams was Mr. damn Norms, Mr. two damn norms, because the... federalist tradition that he helped establish that turned into the wigs and then the republicans and then transmogrified into the democrats now is this super ego, this structural uh this uh a impulse to build structures of of of coersion but towards a productive goal. now you can say yes, exploitation, correct, but they're operating in in a world where exploitation is inevitable, exploitation is built into human existence. they do not believe in the transcendental. power species coming into its own being, why would they? they were, they were before that was a coherent concept, this they were before the working class had come into itself and brought with them the historical agency that had eluded every other class before them, how would they know not to do that, so they thought they were doing good, and and in terms of they were looking out for the best interests of the project of American capital extraction and surplus extraction. and but that means that they're going to restrain things and they're going to adhere to norms and traditions the id, the demand of like the average American since that's why now who gets to call the shots is more land please, more land, land, land, land, or if they're stuck in the city in a wage relationship, more patronage jobs, uh, my cousin needs to get a job at the... at the at the colora pit and also more wages at uh labor jobs at private though eventually as it coheres into working class so that's why I think it's silly to root for one side or another in this stuff and I understand why you have instincts and like in certain cases I think you should. have ready interests, you know like civil war, that's a clear one, but when you're talking about something like you know those jeffersonian and and those those revolving uh conceptions like that generated america's contradictions and then overcame them and created new ones, you can't pick one or the other because they cannot come separated, they're inevitable. i got a uh for the the king, i got the king. uh, no, I think if you're going to make him, I'm trying to think like if I wanted to do anything about the the founding generation, which would be tough because I don't find it terribly interesting, because it really was just a bunch of fancy doile boys uh getting together and creating a play-acting government, creating a fake, a fake little fun time play-doh government, because their built in assumptions that the structures they had imposed would limit popular participation in government enough to ensure that it was essentially a a talking house for a what they imagine to be unified ruling class, because those morons thought that their their refinement and adherence to values was a byproduct of their social position and that it would be the reality and it would that it would form the reality of their class collaboration, forgetting entirely because they couldn't even realize it that no, those fancy beliefs you think you hold are generated by your economic ex interests and those interests are in conflict, and as the conflict deepens, the ability for these play fake pseudo political institutions to to uh restrain uh, to uh redirect energy and reduce friction is going to collapse and the thing is going to bost open, and it started to shake and shimmer immediately, i mean they fucking write the constitution, bill it rights and then second term, third term adams uh puts out the creats the alien. in the sedition act says it's illegal to say mad thing bean things about me on the internet because the guy said that i was a hermaphodite and people it's not just like that was John Adams the reason it was John Adams is because Washington didn't need to do it because he was George Washington as soon as he was gone replaced by a reduced figure a guy didn't have his aura uh the game changed and Washington himself who by that time had been like converted from a guy who thought he could transcend politics like all these idiots did to by the end of his second term a convinced federalist approved of the alien insediction act and the whole thing started breaking apart and the thing that solidified it for a little bit was the uh twin attack the twin moves of the uh Louisiana purchase and then the war of 1812 which settle the boundaries of America in the near term because those were both jefferson uh democratic moves towards accumulation of uh land so that the yoman fantasy could be could persist that the... myth that greg Granden uh talks about, and those two war, those two acts created equilibrium out of the instability of the of the conflict between the land Hungary, expansion Hungary, conflict with Indians Hungary Democrats, Republicans, Democrat Republicans and the federalists who wanted to uh intensify uh market uh financialization and trade uh with specifically. trade with England and Louisiana purchase bought so much land that it essentially reduced the investment that the Jeffersonians had in preserving certain things you know because early on Jefferson was freaking out about everything like they opened a post office and he's like this is tyranny because the the size of the country like the ability to expand within it was still up in the air how were they going to limit like the war kind of started the revolutionary war the real starting pistol was the proclamation of 1763 which set the... mountains as the limit of colonial expansion into North America, that was as soon as that happened, conflict between the United States and Great Britain was inevitable, and they were worried about that happening again, like the worry about tyranny that that moved Jefferson was really a worry about the federal government in the form of this merchantile class in the New England and New York, limiting our. to grow the way that the British had and Louisiana Persius relieved a lot of that pressure, now Louisiana Persius also got it into the huds of the Democrats that we could have the whole thing, which led to the war of 1812, which was a democratic attempt to take Canada, that was why we really went to war in 1812. I know they say impressed of sailors in the history books, but that's like how they say that we win to world war 1 because of the lucitania, even though that happened two years before we declared war, and the lucitanian was sunk in 1950. In 1916, Woodred Wilson ran for reelection on a campaign slogan of he kept us out of war, that's how much the lucitania was in people's minds when they were voted for president, and then a year later, but anyway it's like one of those just stories, the real thing was Canada, we got Louisiana, we're going to we're going to extend freedom, our ability to persist in a fantasy of freedom north, and then it was the the war of 1812, it discredited the federalists because they freaked out so bad that the first real secession movement and America was the Hartford Convention of federalists and and high federalists uh from New England, contemplated a secession of the United States in protest of the war of 1812, because they wanted to make a... trade union with Britain, they did not want to fight Britain, and then it was the terms of the war of 1812, which was essentially, okay, never mind, it was a slap of the hand getting out of the cookie jar from the UK, like okay, you you got it, you got it, you got Louisiana, you're done, and that satisfied the wig of the federalists and you got that brief little moment of of fantasy, the the era of good feeling, the last time that the president ran for election effectively unopposed was James Monroe's re-election campaign uh in 1820 and that was because the the the actual material underlying conflict between the two factions was momentarily uh uh uh at a stalemate what broke the stalemate was the explosion of the profitability of cultive of conton cultivation in the south, because that first generation of of of democrats, the Jeffersonians were all operating at some level on the assumption that slavery was a short-term solution that it would give way over time, because it was its profitability was limited, one thing, it was deeply extractive and damaging to the soil that it operated in, which means there was a shelf life of there was there was the limit to how long you could actually get uh get profit out of particular acrerages and it was incredibly incredibly labor intensive. things like the continent engine and other and and the opening of international trade and the infusion of capital into the south made it more profitable. and what that meant was that slavery became more salient as an economic system separate from the greater American political economic system like the free labor that operated that that the assumptions of government within constitution assumed. because slavery was just sort of left as this thing that existed but was unaddressed in the constitution because they could they had to they couldn't get an agreement on it so they just punted it, but they figured it's okay, we'll always be able to figure it out because it's always going to be this little tea room full of of fancy lads, which it immediately broke up into a real political fight because there were real stakes which they didn't assume would exist because they were dumb asses because they were idealist dumb asses, but you can't blame them because they had to act that way. constitution had to be what it was at the time, because of the unique situation that the United States was being formed out of states that were separate, imagine themselves to be separate, organized governmentally separately and had this uh conflicting economic interests, conflicting populations for conflicting, not and not and and are at the very least so different cultures, and none of them with the power to militarily overall any of the others, they had to compromise like. everything we got in the constitution we had to get, it should have been destroyed by the civil war like the order that uh that it had supported until then when it no longer when it failed to the constitution failed its first real stress test and the fact that we have had like a uh synthesized like completed bourjois revolution after uh after re destruction ended and we haven't had that like degree of conflict within the body politic until now uh we've gone this long without it happening again but it's built in it's built in and like this this presidency this biden trump uh biden presidency where he's the he's the king and mitch McConnell is the prime minister and there's a global fucking pandemic and economic collapse happening I don't know how uh it'll be very interesting. I say, that's for sure, it's it's going to take another stress test, that's for sure, hell yeah, 666 viewers, oh my god, somebody's talking about who's most evil, it doesn't matter, man, Andrew Jackson, profondly evil person, but his position in society, his position within the emerging system of uh of of surplus extraction that was being created in North America, the great project that he was part of threw him up because he fit the moment, he was willing to do the things that the moment demanded, so yes evil, but because the times were evil, the times are always evil. the people in the positions of power are there because they accommodate and support evil, they have made the choice, they've justified it in their mind somehow, either by being a sociopathically self-absorbed or... or if they're a nice tead drinker and a nice well-behaved boy or girl, a nice sublimated individual, they convince themselves it's because they're a smart or good person, and that they have made the right choice and that hey, this is bad, but it could be worse, and if it wasn't me, it'd be somebody who's less smart, who's less compassionate, like i like obama, and they're all going to be empty shells, they are empty shells that just contain the evil of the age to direct it, that's all they are, if they weren't, they wouldn't be there, they would not seek the job, they would not have made the compromises they made in their lives, they were only able to do that because they were steam rolling over their own human impulses, they were steam rolling over their awareness of any connection they had to anybody but themselves, and the thing is is that that is the reason they're in that position, those exalted positions is that we're selecting for that behavior, our social order, in our in our economic order, so those will be the people who will rise, so their evil is to be assumed, it's not to be judged one against the other, the times are what determined the degree of like violness, the degree of like personal satism is is honestly secondary to the whole thing and usually a byproduct of the trauma uh of of living in those times which were more which were less civilized than ours. like Andrew Jackson is the only president who ever actually led a cough of slaves on the Nats trail, actually leading slaves to a market, he did that, the only president we know of, and also of course the only president murdered people in a duel, including one duel where he basically cheated by wearing a very bulky coat and standing to the side and then shot the guy in the dick, but that was a time of slave coffees and dick shooting, so only one good at coffling slaves and shooting dicks will ride. people, I think a lot of people like to think about the evil of of great figures of history, because they imagine, well, I might not be consequential, I might not be remembered, I my might my life might be filled with frustrations and failures and inadequacy, but at least I'm a good person, well your goodness is, I mean in a way, yes, like you can't bring yourself to do the things these people can do, and that does make you a better person, but also you probably didn't find yourself in a position where making the wrong choice was that easy. if you're born into wealth and privilege, you can do the wrong thing very easily, it's harder to do, you have to commit to doing the wrong thing if it work, and that's why generation of of that's why the aj soprano syndrome, that's what the fail sons are, you're not willing to do what it takes to make it in this world, this sociopathic hell realm and so, but you're also addicted to the pleasure of it, you're addicted to the consumer uh uh indulgence, the saparific of consumption and ease of life, so you don't push through to find something play, some place where you can affect work and challenge yourself to do an alternative, and so hundre biden is a perfect example of this, he couldn't do the like Bow Biden was evil. Boe Biden got one of the du Pont sions a sweetheart level deal for raping his child, his three-year-old child. uh he was a freaking scumback, he would have he would have allowed uh dupont to put uh teflon directly in your asshole and your families, they would they would they would allow uh dupot to bring a truck to your house and waterboard you with teflon because he was going to be president someday oh oh got the answer cancer oh own uh Hunter had every chance to do what Bow wanted to do, but he couldn't bring himself, but he was too addicted to ease to do anything hard, so what does he do instead? the second easiest thing, destroying hisself with drugs and sex as a distraction, and of course as a way to punish yourself, because in the long run, you only get more miserable because those pleasures lose their luster over time, inevitably. and the thing is is that that's really the choice we have because we live so atomize lives because the alternative like doing a life living a life where you can find meaning through labor, not necessarily the work you do to live, but like a work towards making the world better, a work a working towards a world where your labor is less exploited and you have more free time. and you're more free from alienation, you can put that energy there, if you think that if there's a if there's a path before you that is can plausibly get you to that, you can always choose that. the problem is for millions of Americans because of our social atomization, because of the decline and the collapse of the working class as any kind of self-organizing principle within a society without a self a self-aware identity, all the options are be evil or do nothing, be evil or distract yourself, be evil or deluge yourself, be evil or drown your brain in in uh fantasia and and um and rude pleasure and find yourself hating yourself every moment of it with and more over time because the third option, the channel of those things into youaningful uh rewarding soul crafting work is not as real, in fact it's invisible, you would have to talk to other people, you have to live near other people, you'd have to live for and with other people, in order to spark that as an op option, and instead we don't have that, we have the despair and and the uh, you either despair or you sell yourself, you you despair or you uh, you you kill something within yourself, you cut, you sever the ties that bind you to everyone else, like jd vans and fucking uh hillbilly elegy where he's that whole movie is just him severing the connections between him and everyone who ever loved him so that he can get ahead. and that's why he's the disgusting reptiliann scumbag he is. now if he'd stayed with that family, it's not like he would have had a good life, he probably would have ended up drinking turpentine and dying of fentinil addiction. that's because those are your options. some people get out, some people may if they have like an extraordinary drive or talent they are aware of and have an ability to pursue that isn't interrupted or destroyed by happenstance. they can make out of there, but those are the broadly the two options you have, and like if you choose to kill that part of you and you are adept at the rituals of you know the managerial class, you go to college and you come out a dull eyed uh liberal or conservative freak, and you channel that freakitude into uh some sort of political sadism and a uh life pursuing misery for everybody, if you don't you come out dunded and stunned and and and failed to launch and you just go back to your mom's basement or you uh curl up uh and you retreat to the internet and and sucker your fantasies of of virtue because you are unable to find a virtuous life within the options given to you and that's most people and then there are the very few lucky who uh are able to uh marry any kind of you know uh autonomy, to marry participation in the market with the ability to maintain any spiritual connection to the world around you, the people around you, that's very difficult, but the people who are successful, but the people who decide can't beat them, join them and cover cut the connection, ones that go to college, that's your ruling class, that's your managerial ruling class, those are your democrats, the ones who uh reject it either because they are. able to apply themselves intellectually in the way that they want, they can't sit there and type, they can't get enough words per minute, they don't understand how what, they can't get their head around the technical elements or they can't get their head around the uh rituals of uh etiquet, they either, what, maybe they if they if they have hustle and uh and connections and luck, maybe they uh start a boat ownership place, maybe maybe yeah like these are the beautiful boaters, the non-college educated wealthy people who make up the base, the most consistent base of Trump support, but also... so the ones who don't vote for Trump, but maybe have you, a uh hvach job or or something like that, a few remaining working class, work with your hand jobs that uh that are available to people uh, but then the rest, if you have cut the connection, you are going to be a criminal, you're going to take your disregard for social forms out on the society itself, which is a all these are the rational response to the horrors that we're dealing with. and that's the monstrosity, so lucky my brain happens to have the right shape to make tech money, correct, you have nothing to do with it, wherever you are in this hierarchy, it is, it's it's the uh, a throw genetic dice and not just genetic dice, the dice the genetic, the genetic dice of everyone you grew up around and with and interacted with who shape you in the way they did. so only podcasters are virtues is what i'm saying? no, i'm not, see once again, none of this is about virtue, none of this is about virtue, no one is anywhere that they are because of virtue, that's the fantasy of neoliberalism, neoliberalism says, yeah, you see this random spray of people where a bunch of people are fucking miserable all the time and a relatively small handful of people get to hold on to some little chunk of of uh indulgent pleasure on the top end of a distribution curve, yeah that's awful, but at base some of them are there because it's all there, all of them are there for a reason, and it makes sense, and as Matacias said about buildings collapsing in Bangladesh, it's okay. because the liberal and and the conservative says yeah uh smart people succeed but uh dumb people fail and if that's and if it that distributes itself along racial lines well facts don't care about your feelings look at this iQ chart if you're conservative you say or if you're liberal like you say yes people are suffering why well if it's if you're a member of minority group it's because of racism that's too bad but it's also part of our society darn well between the world and me am I right folks? uh and now we even are expanding that to white people with the hillbilly, which is hillbilly elegy is a perfect copy of a white version, a white like identity polit, like a a a white uh scotch irish id paul like lived experience version of like a one of those movies that's essentially a uh an extended college admissions essay like uh about about like Antoine Fisher about somebody struggling from poverty and then finding success in the marketplace because of their stick-tuitiveness, their their adherence to good values in the face of the trouble, and in the in the racialized uh uh uh narrative that liberals and bibe, these people break out that the families are held back by racism and the legacy of racism, you watch that and you go, damn that's too bad, but the system can still reward somebody who has something else, these virtues and those virtues make him worthy in a way that even the people that we pity who don't make it, we can't. artworthy. hilbiliology, instead of it being racism, it's well the factory, it's a wave towards class like they're poor. why they're poor, we're not going to talk about it because we can't reduce it to racial category, which is what we like to describe things with, because we want to be liberal, we want to make it about personal animis, we want to make it about beliefs and and ideas as why people treat each other the way they do, not material conditions generating relationships between people that they then follow, like like scripts that are determined by relations. relationships, material relationships, no, no, no, it's personal ideas, so but so they just say they're poor as an identity, poor is an identity, like fried bolony sandwiches and swimming in the creek, this is these are class markers, the same way that like hair braiding and uh, you know, cookouts are in, you know, like menace to society or or boos in the hood or something, uh, and there are the people who fail and struggle, even though they should succeed, but it's just there's something wrong with them, like Amy adams, his mom in hell billiology, she's smart. she's a nurse, but she's heroin addicted, and why is she heroin addicted? she's just, she didn't have the strength, she wasn't able, she was, she blamed other people and she was something wrong with her, jd Avance doesn't do that, he's a good person, he's better than her, he is better than her in a fundamental way, and i say there's no virtue here, no virtue, i am not virtuous, in this sense that you're trying to talk about, the alternative to submitting either to becoming evil or to being just ground to dust uh is to fight and we don't know how to fight, but I am saying we will learn to fight, but not through thinking it out. on here, not through hashing it out on here, not through pushing anybody to the left or building meme armies or determining the correct position on issues, it's gonna be, it's gonna be stiffening the senius with uh, lived experience, ironically enough, of struggle, not if not successful struggle, hopeful, a struggle with a horizon, instead of just the the the seeming over determined uh cascade of misery that surrounds us, the sense that before us everything is impossible, yeah, if you step back, it all looks impossible, it looks like an impenetrable forest, but you got to get closer to find the chinks in the army, to find the exhaust port to shoot the fucking uh, missile into the death star with, and you're only going to be there if you're there, not here. All right guys, my battery is almost gone so I got to go, peace and chicken grace.
