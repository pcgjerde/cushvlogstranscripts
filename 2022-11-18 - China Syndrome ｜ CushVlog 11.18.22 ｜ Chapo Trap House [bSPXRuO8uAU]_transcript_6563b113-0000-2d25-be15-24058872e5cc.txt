 My body is a cage that keeps me from dancing with the one I love, but my mind holds the key, I'm living in an age that keeps me living with the love, and my mind holds the key. My body is a cage that keeps me from dealing with the one of and my mind holds the key. my body is a cage that keeps me from dealing with the one i love and the man holds the key welcome to my chat room, let us chat, chat's democratic, oh man, somebody writes a, oh shit, that would be a great name for a book about like the 21st century internet left, chance democratic, if anybody knows uh that would, oh it would be a delicious pun on a a seminal work on uh early American working class politics by Sean Willens called chance democratic, so you could call it chats democratic, and it would be about like you, the online left, I'd probably be in there, which would be very, very sad, because the local foco's actually got something done, so we'll be talking about the second half of the China boom uh by Hafen, I believe fuck uh, but first i just got to say something about people freaking out but not freaking out really having this like erotic expiry expiration around twitter ending and it's fascinating to watch like last night all the news came out oh you know the uh elon fired everybody and they're locked out of the building and that means this is it so everybody's posting like oder to know you gentlemen's type stuff like near my god to the titanic going down moments and the... entire thing had this air of like a celebration, this people who had spent every day of their lives on twitter complaining about how awful it was, how it was the hell site, how it was miserable, how they felt horrible being there, in that moment of like you know anniholation when the promise of being freeed from this thing comes on the horizon, they're able to look back and be like, actually I loved it, it was the greatest thing of my life, it made everything in my life. possible, I owe my sanity to it, all that stuff, all that stuff that, it's not more true than the stuff about lahel site that they hated it, that was true too, like that's the that's the reality of living under capitalism, that's the thing that turns us all, eventually uh, mad, is that all of our pleasures are are lashed into this uh sado masichistic framework where the things that keep us going literally like the things that uh allow us to survive. in the punishing, alienating, lake capitalist doldrums we live in, are the very things that keep us connected to it, keep us welded to it, and things that emerge out of it, that's the dialectical really, and we can't do anything about it, oh god damn it, is the robot voice back, i think that means i'm double, i forgot to did i not, yeah, i have the thing muted, god damn it. so it's like we have to imagine cyus happy and ciscifis is fucking happy, i'm going to log off and log back on because last time it didn't do this. so uh that might work. okay, i literally turn it off and turn it back on again in the style of boomers, which i am, i am boomer, don't fucking, okay, goomer, but you call me ok boomer, guess, you're just telling me who i am, i'm i know i'm a boomer, fuck off. but it really shows that like there is both this like love and addiction to twitter like everything else that we're we're lashed to the mass of uh and also this deep loathing not even of the thing but of ourselves for being dependent upon it uh because we could theoretically break free, this is the reality that we can't really talk about we could all of us break of all of the shackles that we are on as a society, we could cut through the the the the black iron prisons gates with the fucking laser of our minds. now not blaming anyone for not doing it, i'll tell explain why even though we could, we don't, but the capacity, i do believe exists and the thing that would make it happen is if enough people decided, the rules don't apply to me, i am going to act like this reality is as illegitimate as it actually is as opposed to in every moment of my life uh adhering to its dictates, not just in public, but privately, the the self policeman in your head, and what that policeman is motivated by, the thing that keeps you going, is not really the one in the home anyway, is is uh, the one powered by your addictions, by the things that have given you some sort of relationship of uh of mission and task and purpose, and you're going to can focus on those, because that is where you're able to approximate something like the human will to power, to to uh connection too, because remember like all of these things run against connecting to other people, they run towards hording pleasure to the self, because pleasure cannot be really shared without a sacrifice, and in a world where all sacrifice seems fudle, the logical thing is to hoard pleasure. but if you decide these pleasures are not my pleasures, these are an alien in position, then yes, you will be thrown into immediate jepardy, you will be thrown out of uh the degree of comfort that you do have, and I do mean comfort down to the level of a roof over your fucking head, or a roof of your choosing as opposed to a state. provided roof if you know what i mean or actual death, those are all to the to the you, to the embodied being separated from the whole, those are all worth pursuing, because what else is there? that's the first thing we have, because our I mean our relationship to our body is already sort of an abstraction, like the intellectualized self is a fantasy and it is only sustained through belief. like our belief in ourselves is as fundamentally religious as our belief in god or science or anything else and that's a thing that new atheism misses and always did, because the very self that you're trying to use to determine reality through rational faculties is a theological conviction, because you are in the backwash of this body, like the mind is only processing stuff, the body is already done in response to an environment that it's in, those instantaneous responses that form our bodily reaction to the world around us, we don't get to think about it, we don't get to decide consciously, using language, using our self, we cannot think them into being, they have to come faster than that, what we think is, okay, what did we just do and why? we make a narrative at post. narrative about what the fuck just happened, that is what consciousness is, by the way, this is also why i do believe that god, not just in the sense of oh man we're all god, but like a a universal consciousness moving towards a goal of self realization, like that is what a god would be, that is what it is, like that is our notion of God as an actualized human self, that's what mormanism imagines god to be, that's what all of the the monotheistic religions that emerge. once you have like a concrete fixed relationship between uh one class, a slave class and one masterclass, that dialectic is going to power all of human social history and therefore all of its structures, all of its modes of production, but so you we're all seeking something that will sever our connection, and the thought is, the fantasy the people have is, if twitter goes away, then i will be forced to find uh meaning to be, new tasks, missions closer to myself, which means closer to other people, and that means hey, i'm going to through those actions build these new connections with other people that change my hedonic calculus, that make me now be like, oh, my narrow pleasures can't sustain me, because we don't have easy ones like twitter, we have things that are harder to come by, we flee to the internet because the satisfactions of life are harder to come by, or even if we can access them, our enjoyment of them declines. over time geometrically just as the rate of profit falls, the rate of pleasure falls over time in one specific type of pleasure, the rate is determined differently, the rate is determined by our access, the more access the pleasures we have, the more we will be able to pursue those pleasures and stay ahead of their declining like actual felt enjoyment, but once you put so just like once an empire reaches its territorial limit, the decline sets in, and this is all echoed through every structure of consciousness, the self making making itself, the mind making the body legible, because yes, the same thing, but the mind is alienated by definition, but that alienation can be managed by a conscious awareness of it, but turns into over time a deeper, reflexive belief in it. which means determining the way you encounter the world and the way your body responds to the things it sees and hears and and senses, the evidence of its sensus that your body is acting on without you thinking about it, but if you trust your body, then there is no break between what you want and what your body wants, and therefore you're going to make the right decision, it's why we're stuck making no decisions because we can't even connect to our own bodies, because we're fully our minds now, that's the final we're. pulled ourselves out of our bodies, capitalism has helped us do that, it's the technology that pulled our souls out of our body and now it's just floating uh, but it can't, but we're still stuck in bodies, how do we manage that? we have to go back into our bodies, and I think that's what we're all doing, that's why I feel like I'm doing, like I feel like in describing myself uh on these vlogs, I swear to god, I feel like I am managing my own impending death, because I have in a hypochondriact my entire adult like. since my injury is a teenager and that means that I uh have basically described my entire life trajectory as one towards anniholation because the self is all I really felt. I've always been super alienated from my body to a neurotic degree. And then I had this injury as a teenager that just wrecked my uh my ability to like sense my own body like to sense my uh danger level because I'm... pain all the time, and so I spent years just panicking about the feelings I had and turning them into death, and I still do that, but now instead of worrying about, oh, is this really happening, am I really dying, and then trying to reason myself out of thinking I'm dying, and then ignoring it through pursuit of things like going on Twitter. but over time the pleasures of that get less, but the feeling, the pain, the anxiety is still press the same amount, so it this this thing is my body put like, it's my body pushing against myself saying, like you're gonna die soon, relatively soon, in that you are mortal, but if you do you will not be able to get back in your body in time. you will not be able, you will be lost, you will be severed, you'll go to hell, outer darkness, gahena, or just be annihilated like Tony Soprano, if you're a materialist, one way or another, it is a, it's a fear of metaphysical extinguishment, that is insanity, because you're not, not, you're you're you're the body is you, it's all one thing, and the death of the body is the freedom of the soul. but only if that death is a peaceful one or at least i really do think everybody is saved, but the amount of pain you experience, fear and pain you experience before it happens in your individual life, that's not up to you to decide, accept how to respond as its ending, and if you can address your death uh, what hideger talks about, then you can rob death of its terrors, and the earlier you're able to do that, the more you're able to negotiate your life and the feelings your body has and the feelings of danger and feelings of reward and punishment, feelings of uh safety and love beyond the self, and you'll be able to realize, oh, my pleasures are only those that can be shared, and what does it mean, what are the implications of that? it changes what you can have fun with, what you can have fun doing your doing with your time, because you're able to think, when i die, i will look back on the life that i have at this moment, like imagine that because we don't. when we are going to die, that is the fantasy that the the fantasy underlying my hypochondria is that you can know, that is what comes out of the rationalist fantasy that has emerged out of Christianity, that oh shit, we've we've run out of road here in terms of a metaphysics, so what what can we do, how do we make sense of this? uh, and that... creates this model of irrationality. if we can, if we can describe the universe, we become God. i think that is the underlying metaphysical logic of of capitalism, and that is why every capitalist is trying to become literally god. for for a long time, rich people built monuments to themselves, but that was because of the amount of technology that there was uh allowing and uh abeting their rule, you know, fucking pyramids. uh the big graves and then later uh public works, like once the political sphere opens up more and it's not just aboing the will of God as interpreted by you know your priests now that you need a deliberative deliberative process because you need you have more technology that you have to wield, yeah like you have to, this is why I think Dawism is the one religion that is not terminally poisoned by the logic of class society, which is why you hit a dead end with Christianity and buddhism because you're creating uh a dichotomy, an artificial dichotomy between dying as a sinner and dying as a saint, dying is someone has been saved or someone has been damed, even Hinduism and even Buddhism, the one the religions that embrace um the circle still have an underlying preference. a a a a a imposed preference for one way of being over another in terms of like its ultimate resolution like it the cycle that you are trying to escape right has people who are closer and farther away from escaping it and so you have like a holy class who spend their life basically not experiencing uh the drag of pleasure the drag of desire and the... for achieving extinguishment, which is the reunion with all, which is the same as the death of the body, but it is also, the concept that heaven in every less abstracted religion tries to explain, tries to get across and fails, that is what that's and and that is different than somebody who's going to die and come back and have to go through more and more pains, more and more misery. unthinkable amounts considering how much misery exists in the human life, and that's that's a thing to avoid, and so you need a class society to allow people to pull up to provide uh instruction, but what if the end experience, the final experience of all minds is the body making sense of? the actual end of life in that little tail behind extinguishment that is the soul, so that means sure you go through a bunch of fucking other lives after your own, but the experience of of final awareness is still a narrative that retrospectively brings everything together, and therefore heals all pain. and if all pain is healed, then letting go is possible, that's what we all fear, regardless of religions that we won't be able to let go, and why? because we live alienated from ourselves and each other thanks to the reality, the persistence of class social rule. that is why no religion can encompass this truth in the moment of the end of capitalism, when class rule, which is terminating here in capitalism, one way or the other, i do believe that has to be reckoned with, and of course i might be wrong, capitalism might persist. there might not be a crisis, but here's the thing, everybody in human history lives with some notion of apocalypse, because you can only make sense of everything retrospectively, which means all of our notions of conscious are built on a a perception of something that's already happened, and we actually have, we have uh, by the way, we have recorded and I believe the south pole, evidence of particles moving backward through time, I think people can correct me if I'm wrong on this in the chat. but there is been i obviously i'm a laman and this is me pulling things out of my ass but i'm just talking about what vibes to me what things vibrate together it makes sense you can sort out the details when later you have to act first and that means also intellectually you have to act first and one of the reasons we're all paralyzed intelectually as well as spiritually is because we can't act but we can only figure out what what to do after acting the reason there's so left is because it's a bunch of people waiting for an action because they are too. strapped to their uh um strapped to their obedience, we are all strapped to our obedience, but if this is true, what does this mean? when you die, you're just dead, right? everything that the materials say, it just, it goes black, right? you stop getting signals, it stops telling a story, that is true. but the implications of that, i think mean on the reverse of that, that the that the retrospective reconciliation of the soul is also inevitable. what does that mean? that means god exists in any form, any in form that an individual or a group of individuals can imagine, not consciously picture. this is the important thing, this doesn't come from thinking about him all the time, thinking about some. abstract notion of God, it comes deeper than that, it's the reason that you don't, you don't will your dreams into being, you don't, you don't stage that tableau, that tableau is staged for you just as reality, quote unquote reality is staged for you, because it's all staged, it's all a hologram, but the implications of this is, oh, I don't have to worry, and what that means all means, I don't have to worry about anything, I don't have to worry about... literally anything, including losing my uh, my my adherence to the world, meaning I can turn against the state in a meaningful way, meaning I can start saying no in a meaningful way, one of the reasons we don't do it is because there's no organization to put our action toward other than just being anti-social, there's there's uh politics, but politics is compromise because it's being done by a bunch of people who have not... had that moment, you know, that spiritual pop, the belief, because it is an it is not being given to us, we come to it individually by fluke, our our conditioning is to the non-existence of God, regardless of what we think we believe, regardless of uh of how much how based our trad catholicness is, or how deeply grounded are evangelical? faith in in in god, luther or fucking, i guess i should say kelvin's god, buse kelvin is the one who's refining this thing into an actual religion of capitalism as opposed to Luther's earlier criticure of the d, like luther's conception of luther's protestant reformation is the um cry of the dying feudal order like as it's it's deny oh like oh this thing is going to die, how can we save it? and luther is trying to save it, Luther fails to save it because it cannot be saved. Calvin then emerges with the birth of capitalism as the refined form that can adhere to capitalism and push humanity towards its extinguish, it's extinction, because remember the social order is what's emerging from these, the collective brain of the social order, the collective will of the social order is what's being expressed by people like Luther and Calvin, these people are history compacted to a point and then they become the mouthpieces for historical forces beyond their conception and luther is the is the mouthpiece of the historic of the conception uh of a feudal order that is in terminal crisis and the reformation is this attempt to uh to it it recognizes that the catholic religious tradition is damning us to hell because it is making us into capitalist because capitalism remember is embedded in feudalism at this point and is emerging and there are capitalist all through feudalism now they're living amongst everyone else but they are living in a way that is dramatically alienated in a way that they're none of their neighbors are not and their neighbors respond against them, anti-semitism emerges from this, it's the autoimmune uh, i'm sorry, it's the immune system of the feudal order, because the peasants get exploited by these capitalist systems that even existed in the medieval like hydro feudalism, like like money lending and stuff. "it was concentrated around this social other, which of course, that was that was the machine protecting itself, and under stable conditions it could do that forever, but the conditions were stable, the the land got depleted, that's a big part, even before the black death, the land is getting depleted, that's crucial, that's where the enclosers come from that, and then you got you know the little liceage which just knocks all the fucking uh pieces off the board and luther you know the son of of a of a capitalist like this is how close luther is to this transition okay Luther's dad was a uh was a peasant farmer in Germany or I'm sorry Luther's grandfather luther they were they were the luthers, they were the luthers, uh, so Luther's grandfather, no, I'm sorry, I got it wrong, I'm sorry, father, I'm literally saying father, his dad, I believe Hans Luther, was born a peasant farmer, he did work on on his own lands and on the lands of the local Lord, uh, in in Germany, in in I believe Saxony, or thiringia around there, uh, which is where those cities. popping up that are really doing capitalism and where the the the screws are starting to get tightened and where the post uh black death situation where the the peasants had a lot more uh leverage that's getting knocked down by the state you know enforcing this new um uh this new capital forward formation hey these lands they don't belong to you they belong to me uh and i can charge you rents that are market rents and i can enclose common so that you can't sustain yourself, there's responses to that, some people become religious fanatics that themselves on fire, some people become drift to the cities and become peasants, i'm sorry drift to the cities and become either soldiers or maybe try to make their way in the trades if they're young enough, but probably fall to the bottom. there are a few industrious money getters like Hans Lutter who take on uh paid uh wage making labor in the in the in uh the agricultural sector and save up enough money to go to the city and uh use the new financial instruments is the thing he knew about this stuff a lot of the people they had no idea this was happening it was happening above their heads because it's associated with literacy and things like that uh and he comes in to the city and he lays down a sec of uh gold coins and he is able to lease a uh silver mine, i believe it was silver, it might have been uh four uh, but and he's able to use new techniques to make it more profitable and he becomes a fucking city burger, but the whole time he is by the way in huge debt uh, because he never own ans any of these mines, so even though he's becoming a like member of the city council in airfort uh becoming a big shot like a rotarian type guy, he's in the fucking hack to everybody because he's got to keep paying off each loan with the last one, he only make he only pays off uh um the operation completely like a couple years before he dies like he just he barely has time to enjoy it after uh giving up the hustle and then of course their son he's got to rise up in the world so they pat him on the ass and they send him off. to law school, but there's this, he has the heart of a peasant, not because of uh, not because of genetics, just because of the million you grew up in, yeah, Yes, he's in the city, but like first generation, like these the the moris of the people he associates himself with, they're betting himself every second that he's alive, deeper than his conscious knowledge, he is becoming embedded in a social reality, and his dad is his dad though is more uh wetted to, he he's psychologically more wetted to this project, he's more motivated, and that is a thing that comes down to individual uh uh individual biology obviously, but also experience. nature, nurture, those things create a ball of person that has certain abilities, virtues, ways of seeing the world, and hans luther's was forget money getting, luther's was not, and so he has this revelation when he almost gets hit by lightning to uh go to become a churchman, that's because he has fleeing from the reality, the implication of becoming a a capitalist subject. that's what Luther is doing there. and he goes to the church where he thinks he can still adhere to these section uh these these social connections and what does he see the church oh my god the church is a business too there's money lenders in the temple why is that? well he can't he cannot analyze this the uh material conditions because he's in them he's immersed he cannot recognize those uh things for what they are, he can only see the cleavages and the cleavage here is between religion as understood and religion as practiced, religion of Christianity and its implications for the self and for the value system that they should that a person should hold versus the value system that the society you find yourself in actually holds. and so he's shaving and but because he's a guy whose brain is just built that way who's who's his anxiety manifests itself in this hyperliteracy this this logaria like he just starts he starts basically a a a a a paroximum of writing that can only sustain itself why because the printing press exists the reason that guys like me are on twitter and then going on to podcasts because that's the path of least resistance. to our attempt to explain our persistent pinging we're feeling from God somewhere, from some knowledge that something greater than us exists, and then we want to make the world adhere to that, because that would allow us to die with the least amount of sin, the least amount of sense that we have violated our brotherhood with one another. That's the thing that keeps us from letting go and the pain that we have to inflict on ourselves by dying. uh unreconciled and therefore having to be born again into another body to go through it again and again, you know, or go to hell, like if you're if you're believe enough, just burning in hell, not for eternity, but you know, until you're spit out the other end, so it's like purgatory comes after hell, and it's often pointed to by uh luthans as like this horrible innovation, and it was because it allowed them to do the scam with the uh uh, with indulgences. which allowed the church to just grab a bigger piece of surplus, because that's all these machines are. the uh the machinery of feudalism is just a extraction mechanism by different elites, military aristocratic but also religiously aristocratic, the fucking uh, the sword, and and the the cross, and it's like we all are forced by capitalism to live as hypocrites, and that gets to us and it makes us worried, what if I die right now? well, I look around and feel... like what I'm surrounded myself with, my life, what I've done with it, does it adhere to something that doesn't deserve punishment, and of course we're the one administering punishment, because we we imagine that we are the god who gets to uh decide, but we're not, all we can do is prolong the process by tournamenting ourselves, by uh fleeing to corporality, to a chance to avoid the final judgment, but the final judgment will be. universally, the final judgment is acceptance, because how else would it work? it is a reconciliation to a conclusion, because narrative is inherently retrospective, which means we either got, however you want to imagine it, it's God as a consciousness, in space time, that's the thing, has to be in space time, this is why is why more rationalist types have problems with western religion, religious notions of of a god. because uh, how is it physically embodie? we're violating what we know, which is that there is no separation between space, time, any of these things. there is no out, there is nothing outside, that's the fantasy that we uh have to believe in to move our bodies around, because if we really perceived ourselves as connected to everything else, we would not be able to sustain ourselves, we would not be able to captain the ship of humanity, that's what all consciousness is, but it reaches a certain point when the richness of the fantasy becomes so powerful that we are able to assert independent uh action on earth, we get to do things other than... our bodies tell us to, because now we're telling our bodies what's happening, and that is why free will is absolute. our bodies are being pinged around and you can look at them as this, oh, you had to this, had to this, had to this, but where that's moving, it's not being determined by random chance, it's being determined by this, the uh, the quantum moment when decisions are made, that's where we all live, we live in that quantum zone, and then what do we know about the quantum world, we know that the laws of physics we understand don't exist there, right? we know that, so that means they're not, that means they these things are, these notions of uh, if we accept that like that is the level of consciousness, the level of the quantum, the consciousness exists in that gap between your body being ping through space, and what your brain tells your body to do, because of its misperception, this is crucial, the misperception of the world around it. and see, this is why I can do this, I can play play, I can do this show and feel like, hey, you know, I, maybe I am dying, or maybe the world is getting worse than I think it is, and disaster is more imminent, or maybe I am one of those guys who's just gonna keel over of a fucking heart attack or have a fucking stroke or get cancer, uh, fast, I don't know, I can't know any of those things, I can't know if my body knows when it's gonna end. and I'm trying to talk myself down to youth anasia. The reason I can live in that contradiction though is that I I got to the point where I realize it doesn't matter if that's true because every explanation gets to the same point and because of this retrospective nature of consciousness some embodied creature somewhere gained ability to manipulate at the quantum level. What is that? Whatever it is, I believe, what it is, I believe is a fixed in space and time, technological adherence to reality, to the material reality, the singularity, right, that the capitalist talk about, but they think of it in terms of individual consciousnesss persisting eternally, because they're at the end of the day, fractured western subjects whose, whose understanding of the universe has been fatally dis - adhered to a deeper theological truth that renders religions uh into the tools of power that they become, because why you need a state, why did Luther say we need a state to keep people from going to hell, but what if what if there is no eternal damnation, what if there is not extinguishment, but there is also no internal damnation, what if there is a unwinding, an unclenching. that has the the uh experience of whatever that person's deepest understanding of reunion of of uh of of of of completion would be, and i really feel like doing the show and stuff like that, like talking about this stuff, like i'm sitting here in a body, it's doing stuff, my brain is perceiving it, i perceive a lot of pain in my body, i always have, i perceive things. and where do I perceive them? I perceive them where I think, logically, rationally, there should be pain, but what do I, is it logical or rational, where I think pain should be? Like, I can read about Trump and stuff like, oh, you know, uh, the heart disease, that's the number one killer in America, right, like, American way of life, the one I have, kills people with their heart. Now, of course, realistically, that's still actuarially likely to happen to me specifically. in a a a long enough distance that like the worrying about it more than just like trying to watch what you eat as opposed to like you really going crazy uh like finding a mean where it's like you're sustaining health without becoming like uh fixated on it in a way that's like destabilizing to your uh way of being as opposed to just sitting with anxiety all the time uh until the moment when the quantum superposition happens right, whens opened, but I would say sense, sensuous, sensuous perception, which is how we think of consciousness, is this mirror image of of of this distorted mirror image of the the body and the world it's interpreting because of the distance right, the time and the space time difference, that creates this gap. until the door slams and when the door slams when the thing is opened you have yes the extinguishment of a large mammal, the end of life, all the stuff that is horrifying for a materialist to consider and makes people want to do things like figure out how to do a live forever in a computer, why these people are franically trying to go to Mars, why we can't at the top level where people actually have like enough individual, independent access to capital to like way the direction it goes, why are they all headed towards anniholation? because they have to, have to try to seek this escape, because they are psychotically invested in a distinction that does not exist. so that means that as a science guy, as a guy wh accepted a certain amount of science, at least enough science that i can't uh accept uh like a supernatural intervention at the level that like uh traditional christianity had adhered to people and which was killed by the reformation like i said luther is trying to save uh christianity by trying to save capital save feudalism from itself by reforming it because he thought if everybody can read the bible they'll behave better because they won't be afraid to going to hell, but of course Luther still believes in hell, he has to create a saved and a damned, but if everyone reads the bible, yes, someone's going to hell, but it's none of us, right, and everyone can act that way, problem is they're not allowed to act that way, they have to adhere to this class society where they're either being exploited or exploiting, they're forced to do things they don't want to do, but are being forced to do, either by.... direct exploitation or because their comfort depends on it, their comfort depends on it, and so I'm sitting here saying some stuff that feels true to me, I'm also getting sensations from my body telling me, oh, you are going to die right now, or not right now, pretty soon, now in previous times what would i be do with those feelings and they would spike all the time, i would spend my time kind of anxiously unpleasantly unwinding the logic of it until i distracted myself with something that was uh had to be like the volume kept having to be turned up, so that's what get me on the hadonic treadmill of doom, but i feel like now what i do when i have those feelings is i'm saying stuff that makes me feel. instead those feelings associated not with anxiety and tension, but with relaxation with so that I can think and breathe as opposed to just concentrating on breathing, which gets harder when you're in discomfort or pain, so like if I'm fantasizing about having a heart attack right, that means oh my god, when that happens, I'm not going to be able to like think this is stuff is true because I'm going to be feeling pain, that's scary, but what pain can be defeated as any? woman can tell you by breathing, now of course it's still there, but you're not annihilated by it, and that's the thing we fear, that is what hell represents a pain beyond pain, because it is eternal, but that as i said is impossible, because it's all contain, consciousness contains the whole thing, so we are both judged and judger. and our final realization is the final realization of that fact, and that means our last act is self, as it could not otherwise be uh self-absolution, because i mean somebody says you have ocd, i probably have plenty of unddiagnosed things, thing is because of uh, because i have the the the spinal injury, i never got. the point where i wanted to adhere my feelings of crumminess to psychological causes, because it never got to that point, at least in my mind, it's like i know why i'm i i know why i hurt, it's because of this thing that happened to me, you know, and I, I know why uh, I think certain things and I act certain way, so that's why I would have these like anxieties like, oh, this is going wrong, I'm going to die and I'd be worrying about it, but then I would be worrying my way away from it, logically, and to me, because I was doing that, I was basically maintaining, and sure, I'm probably, I was probably manifesting a lot of awful stuff, I know I was, manifesting a lot of... awful self-destructive behaviors that hurt other people too, but it was a slow enough like decline that i could manage it, and then when the show blew up, it exploded my entire hidonic calculus, it's like oh you have, there's so much more enjoyment to be had, so many more things that you can distract yourself from, so you can just go wild, but that then got closed again by COVID and a number of other things and now it's a new choke point and the pressure keeps building up because i'm getting older, i'm getting out of that zone, the youth zone where the the final thing that puts it off is just the the reassurance of one's uh statistical unlikelihood of being the subject of such a death uh and so that helps you put it off, but eventually that gets harder to do, that keeps going, that's ocks relentlessly, so you can move with the hedonic thing, but the time thing is just a fact, and it's going to change your hormones, it's going to change, your distribution of serums and juices through the body, and that is going to change your ability to to enjoy anything, and so how are you going to keep yourself from destroying yourself or one way or the other by unleashing to opposition with the state? to the degree that you should, and being annihilated, that's one way, or totally pursuing hedonic indulgence to try to smash them at Lamborghini against the side of the wall, good old neon style, where you can't keep persisting is that agonized middle, which we feel as we're hurdling through space and time, we have to do, but we don't, we live in the middle, the middle is all there is, the middle is reality, the choices, the the resolved states, that is our mis perception of the universe around us, the the inherent misperception that comes from being embodied by senses that separate, so what i go by is how my heart feels, like who do i how do i feel? around people, when I'm around the people in my life, I feel really good to the sense that I can sit there and be like, if this is it, like I get an attack and I get a feeling, my heart rate starts racing, because that's the thing, your heart goes up a little bit when you get that spike of perception, and then how do you respond to that? If you believe it's real, you will freak out and you will feel more pain, and you will freak out the people around you, and it will, you'll try to turn it into reality, I've had. that happened before uh, or as I said, you can just let it run, let the clock run, and how can you let the clock run, if you are feeling that that sense of uh ease that makes you that comes, I believe from, well, okay, if this is the time, the reason I don't have to worry about it is because it happens so one, however, I need to imagine I will be reconciled, I will. However I imagine I have to be uh um uh uh forgiven I will be, whatever I'm afraid of happening will not happen, even if it's physical pain, because again it's not physical pain, it's the imagined uh uh world of nothingness, of nothing but pain that fills the mind when pain is sharp, but here's the thing about that that... pain is still contained, it's still narratively packaged, if it isn't, it's not paiin anymore, and so that's why I can sit here and do this show, do these things, read my books in in the world we live in, in the hell world and feel like, okay, what happens, what if this is it, I'm fine. That's the faith, because it's like, well, whoa, what if it is, what if it is, every what if brings you back to where you were, which is in a chair hopefully or lying down, hopefully, you know, not bleeding all over the place, but also even if then, your brain starts dreaming as you die, okay, this is another thing that's not made up, your brain literally starts dreaming as you die, dreams have an ending and it is in waking up, every dream ends, that means the dream of consciousness ends, because otherwise it's not a dream, it's not a dream until you wake up. and is it a good dream or a bad dream? it doesn't really matter, because what you've woken up in is into a greater consciousness, a greater understanding that makes sense of what just happened and resolves the contradictions of it, and forgives those who need forgiving, and collapses down into the the undifferentiated matter of existence. and this is why i say if there's hope in the future it is religion, but it is religion of this type, born out of this new struggle, that's why everybody who's going trad, who has some sort of like fake bullshit anti-capitalist pose is absolutely full of shit, they are craving an extinct mode of class rule, they're the people who are around with Luther was around and we're like feudalism rocks and we want to protect it, not. because it allows us to be good to each other, which is why Luther wanted to save it, but because it allows us to be bad to each other, it allows us the satanic pleasures of life, and that means going back to that uh, all it is is is destroying the architecture, rearranging the deck chair, saying, capitalism's indulgence needs to be curtailed, and all that means is fewer people need to be considered uh worthy of life, like that's all it is, like that's the entire all the brilliant esoteric strands of incredibly thoughtful, new right thinking all boil down to this, it is there needs to be fewer people who are worthy of life, life, saying is defined as your ability to to get the good parts out of the machine, the remaining the machine that's just pumping up profit, surplus that is then sat on. being in that bubble, that is, that has always been uh, the goal, the point of civilization is to create those uh relationships and sustain those relationships, and so like as much as you know the the heart of Christianity is in Christ's message of redemption, uh, that is at the bottom, at the top, it's the other thing, it's it's the punishment, it's it's it's the saved and the... It's it's keeping people uh above the line of misery and aristocracy is one way of doing it, but Aristocracy is only really capable of dealing with the social realities of feudalism, which is some imagine frontier of agricultural peasant labor, as soon as that frontier is reached, you have crisis accumulate eternally, which is what happens in in the early modern period. and then what emerges out of that is this new reality and so we have a new class of uh rulers and they don't believe they didn't believe they started off not believing in the the superstitions of the old world but now we're at the end of history right that's like okay we're going to have to we're going they're imagining we're going to have to get rid of democracy again because we're we're we're thinking this can only get worse which is everybody keeps doing what i'm doing that's the fantasy of annihilation that we want to be saved from. uh, and so the old way, which is democracy meaning in the west, and therefore everywhere eventually, access to, I hate to say it because people get so mad, but treats, yes, treats, I'm sorry, it's treats, it does boil down treats, I know that makes me a PMC bugman, uh, world economic forum student, but it's also fucking true, the democracy imagine, self-actualization, you imagine that you're protecting is capitalist one that says we still have an aristocracy, but it is not determined by fixed relationship to land, but fluid relationship to capital and specifically, culturally, ritually, what we consume with capital, how we publicly consume it, because it has to be publicly consumed, otherwise it stacks up, it has to be destroyed, surplus must be destroyed, all regimes of class society destroy surplus, they do... ritually until a crisis of the ecology makes them start having it uh to eat their own to destroy their own internal structures to adhere to keep it going and undermine it in turn. That's how all societies end, and then something else erupts from below, but with those same structures. So uh, socialism, marxism comes out of Christianity, but so does its opposite, hyperividualism, which is now the governing world ideology of every place. And Aristocracy said, the neo-aristocracy, with its new adherence to the traditional Catholic Church. is saying, let's go back to fixed aristocratic uh access to pleasures, treats that conferr our ability to be refined, our ability to have faith, because the the dusty ravel can't really have faith because they're too busy rooting around in the dirt trying to survive, because we are sitting around all day, because we are acetes, we are able to generate pay-ons to god's love that convince people to believe in God to save their souls. but they don't need that, because they're not going to hell, and that is why anybody who is adhering to a uh, any religious tradition that focuses on separating the sheep from the goats, the saved from the unsaved, is reactionary to court, because given the conditions of the world around us, then the only the only live political question is not, how do we stop this? it is, how do we distribute the pain of this? and if it's if you have, if you have a religion of exclusion and a religion of damnation, then to keep this thing going that allows people to be safe and damned, that allows us to ritually affirm who gets to enjoy and gets to suffer, then they will they will always do whatever, is in their narrowst self-interest, which reinforces capitalism to it. just like at the end of the fucking medieval period, the end of the feudal era, luther is trying to write the ship, but what does he do? he creates a cleavage that leads to the 30 years war and the mid midnight 17th century response to uh, the crisis of feudalism cased by the little ice age. but everybody's so worried about who goes to hell that they fight over that rather than who's in charge who's making hell on earth to plug our fucking podcast coming up. and now where we are, we're we're at the end of history, but because the attempt to create a proletarian subject failed, the the the attempt to create a a class-based point of view, consciousness that has is is sustained by a material reality, like people acting to reinforce it, it was birthed into being in the 20th century, but then it was destroyed, was extinguished, it does no longer exist, now we just have these scraps of identity fighting against each other, who's going to be the ones who are saved, is it going to be the uh people who uh have the aesthetic uh uh sensibility and and refinement to appreciate the exaltant beauty of the byzantine latin mass uh, because my god if it's if if we don't maintain a society that allows them to thrive. then what's the point of anything? or if you'd say fuck that, but no, actually it's a different demographic group, it's the up, it's the downt-trotten, it's not the rich people, it's the poor people, should be in charge, who should get to survive the coming apocalypse, but not all of them as poor people, of course, narrowly as as specific types of poor people, because poor people class consciousness has not been built because people are poor separately, they are poor alone, they're poor as individualized consumers who are sorted by the media by the overpowering media created by capitalism into effective units, demographic units that then go to war with each other for recesses, resources just as the westfalian states went to war with each other. in 19 uh 14, so that means we're going to get another crack up because we can't fix this from the top, it has to come from the bottom, that means it has. to come from outside of our cognitive window, and we have to reconcile ourselves, one, not to dying any moment of the day, but in what conditions? yeah, sure, for surround your surrounded by your friends, in a nice house, sure, but what about outside? you know what i mean? uh, what about in battle? what about sanguinrarily, in a way that is uh, that that it cannot be uh, aesthetically. rapped up, that's uh, that's another question, that's that's the question of pain, and uh, only love and the faith that love represents can transcend those things. how are we going to come to that consciousness through experience, it's the only way it can happen, so like in this thing, this moment that feels like an interesdom while we're like waiting for twitter to die so that we can be freeed, because to get to get back to the beginning of this, if we are freeed by twitter because it goes away, because we can't go on anymore, because that that road is closed, then we have to put that energy somewhere else, and i mean i'd say cynically that for most people they're going to find another thing that is equivalent to twitter, that has puts them in the same lock as twitter, that robs them of their essence the same degree, or but some some percentage of people are genuinely going to have to refocus themselves and in so doing find meaning in connection as opposed to severance uh, because we are reinforcing severance every minute that we're on social media, i hate to say it, but because that's my life depends on it, but it is a fact, that means like this thing is going to go away at some point, and we have to reconcile ourselves to it being sudden, and to it making us have to reforge understandings of the world that are going to be pain. one way or the other, and that is what I daily strive to do is to uh, is to filter my feelings through that lens and I don't have to do it consciously, this is a beauty part, because I can go and examine like when am I feeling actually, like you know, below conscious thought, like the thing that we're again trying to make sense of afterwards, my body, you know, what is it sending to me, and and uh that'l go up and down, but our narrative of it can change and it can change our relationship to our bodies. uh, and yeah, like one way that I've been able to redirect things is that I read more now, and I do more projects, I do more uh, I work more, like the hell of presidents thing, like that's a lot more, because when I'm doing that, I feel this glide, and that's what it is, it's we're all seeking the glide, which is is the way right in daosm and uh you know the the the the search for Dawcamy is to search so that everything you're doing you feel like I want to be doing this and I should be doing this and your body will tell you that your body will tell you that but that is not it's not making remaking the world as you see fit it is fitting into the world as it is uh but of course I don't glide all the time because you know there's a reckoning there's a reckoning in my body. there's a reckoning just from all the memories that I hold that I've experienced you know that uh that is not goes doesn't go away completely it can be managed but it's still a a signal it's like a tinitus or a fucking car alarm it's just a question of turning it up and down and it's managing that dial because it's being a stride sensation and it's not feeling them feeling them is part of it but uh and and one thing that and what headenism promised. is is, oh, I will feel like this all the time, but of course that is literally the devil's false promise. um, it is feeling that way even when you feel bad, you know, it was feeling something other than anxiety and something other than tension, even when you feel bad some way physically, or you're in in a uh tedious or unpleasant situation, and uh, yeah, it's like, it's just it's this process of basically recoding your... uh uh deeper reactions to things by being conscious of the way your body is responding, that's why breathing is so central to basically every religious uh practice, regardless of what its name is. i realized i have not even come close to talking about the book and this is uh annoying. i'm sorry, but i feel like some of this was pretty useful. i honestly think I'm going to have chris chop out the parts of this uh that are about. uh Luther and stuff and maybe put it on YouTube, I think it would be a good uh amendment, a good like intro to the first episode, because we talk all about Martin Luther in the first app, so I've been thinking about it a lot. Yeah, he was trying to bash feudalism uh back into shape, because if everybody read the book, including rulers, merchants, they would be like, oh, money doesn't matter as much, pleasures don't matter as much, I should act for my fellow man, and feudalism could respond to the fact that oh, uh, the x amount of land can no longer sustain y amount of people, like because we're extinct, we're we're draining it of resource, we're draining it of nutrients, uh, it's it's losing it. it's productivity, but our population is exploding, how do we manage that? and as long as you needed an economy to be, hey peasants, you work, we just sit here on top of it, and what do we do with our time? we fight each other over bigger portions of land so that we can. and then have little sports that are simulations of our wars like hunting and and jousting and shit, and then eating all the surplus, as I said, publicly consuming all of the surplus, that that's that's our society, what if there's less surplus? oh, we going to have to get more from the peasants, squeeze them out, uh, and the church is part of that, and the fucking indulgence is how to get more fucking surplus, because you cannot, because there's nothing in feudalism that uh, that forces. is anyone to improve their uh production of uh of agriculture, improve the soil basically over time, because if they're going to just get a fixed percentage taken from their leader, no matter or from their league lord, no matter what, and they're going to be fixed on the land, then and working on a land on farming, farming is tedious and and and unpleasant. you're going to work as little as possible, it's always going to be the case. uh, so you're like, fuck you, I'm not doing anything, and uh, or I mean, I'm not going to work anymore than I have to, and you can't make them because power is not concentrated to uh, actually coerse, but once you introduce a uh fixed or, I'm sorry, a uh, a market in rent that says, oh yeah, the the connection from to the soil, that's gone, you know that connection to the soil that's part and parcel of your religious understanding and that makes all of it makes sense, the thing that like the grass root of it, the beating heart of it that actually does me like, oh yeah, my life is difficult, but it also provides me with these uh reconciliations, these soluces of god's existence, you know that I can find help for my uh, that's all gone, everything that allows you to live in this world is gone. come on, good luck, what are you going to do? and yeah, you either become desparing, you become a rebel, or you move to the town, or you suffer under the yoke, but the more you suffer, the less you're going to get out of the land, and what happens in England is is there's this free market in in uh, in leases that means if you can't hustle, you will lose the land, and that means somebody else will get it, and who's that going to be the person? who is more motivated, the person for whom who is able to look at what's happening and figure something out, the more not, you might say intelligent, but it's it's as much luck as skill, and and you have to take the uh, you have to take the judgment out of it, because we're talking about individual uh, axisses of like perception, and we're saying, these are better than those, because they help us do this, but they don't do it by themselves, that is what, that's the, that's why we're headed. towards apocalypse because we're trying to deify one type of consciousness is superior to all others and then like make it eternal, but that value system is based around one facet of a basically infinitely faceted diamond of human consciousness, but it's not just intelligence as we would understand it, it's much more than that, it's uh color, it's it's attitude, it's how agitated are you, it's how much does being in a body freak you out and make you want to do something, that different. from person to person, sensitivity, but not sensitivity to everything, sensitivity to certain things, and again, shaped by behavior, shaped by uh, your encounters in life and traumas, to use that word, oh god, and that's going to drive some people to do what Hans lootter did, and go to the city and make his way in the world, and then those people are going to be the only people in the world, capable of acting in acting with a effect, because they can't act in concert, because everybody in the city has the goal of making more money, all the other elites have completely conflicting goals, yeah, they want more money, but how they're going to get it is winning the gamembo, winning the game of th. but meanwile the game of thrones is becoming less and less important because who gets what is being determined in these towns, not in the courts of the kings, the mar graves and the land graves, or of the fucking cardinal nephes and the pope, that means a new religion, a religion of people who are in that condition, and how do you how do you create it, luther doesn't create it? he's left in uh the bin. Calvin creates it by making a totally individualized rational religion, but says your perception as an individual is the sum total of reality. your rational response to that is the sum total of God's uh realm, of God's conception of the world is only through your individual perceptive key hole. this is absord, this is about as deep blasphemy as you can commit, but it it interrupts from. sitting in a room reading the bible all day, instead of making religion an actual communal endeavor, and what are you going to do more of? are you going to do more feast days and processions as somebody in the city? or are you going to do more business? where you have to treat people as strangers, not as brothers in Christ. Okay, I'm debating whether I should just go long today or postpone this, because I've already done an hour, feel like I got across some salient things, yeah, what do we what do we think folks, what do we think? All right, well I probably won't go too long and honestly. is not much to say, so the second half of the book is pretty anti-climactic. because the first half is like, okay, here's the chinese state built up post uh from the fucking uh, the the ching to uh, to to jizhi, yeah, it's like, what is the state, what is the state capable of, is it capable of, does it represent a challenge to global us-based capitalism, can it represent an alternative to and uh the answer is uh no, not all, are you fucking crazy? what is wrong with you? why would you even think that? i have to say the tone of the second half is very much d, because he starts from the premise from the uh from the world systems wallensteen arigy premise that socialism wherever it emerged as a as a mode of production in the 20th century was not. separate system from capitalism, but a subsistent, but um, a a a system within the greater machine of capitalism, and I think that is 100% correct, by the way, you want to come at that, you can, I don't agree, to me that seems uh, beyond debate at this point, I understand why people want to believe that these states existed as like genuine, different, different uh, operated anyway, as like, and the thing is culturally they did operate as an alternative, but again, at the deeper level, they are component pieces, which means over... time their economies are shaped by the reality of competing against other capitalist states. the USSR was broken by this contradictions that had accumulated by that point, but the fresher, younger ccp, which is built on a nationalist struggle as opposed to the Russian revolution, which was specifically anti-nationalist in character, and remember, nationalism is what comes bubbling up first from modernity, way before you get to socialism, it's nationalism, so that... was was born under the conditions of capitalism, with Russian characteristics emerging in the Soviet Union, so that means that when the crisis comes, it fucking splinters, it shatters like a fucking uh, like a fucking condel getting shot down by a ranchaw, but in China where there is this unifying national struggle that undergirds the state ideology, there is legitimacy to impose a uh well legitimacy and here's the important part capacity to really adapt and and it's not just uh that they have this nationalist myth to fall back on it's that because of that the uh state the chinese state, the communist party state has done things with that legitimacy. some of those things were bad and disastrous, but also kind of necessary, because you got to shake the dew off the peasant lily to make modernity, this is an undeniable fact, and honestly people should be more... acceptable accepting of the Wallinsteine Riigi thing because it really does take the soviets and the Chinese off the hook a little bit like the they thought socialism in one country was possible, they were wrong, they thought it and they acted like it, and the thing is they were building capitalism without knowing it, or at least building an inevitable road to crisis that would create either capitalism or anniholation, and Russia basically got a little bit of both, China though, because it shook the do off the peasant Lily, uh but then with the cultural revolution sort of pivoted and and and cleansed itself of its guilt for that, like if you look at the great terror, you can look at the great terror in a number of ways, one way that I think if useful is to look at the great terror is, the great terror was the not so much, it was yes, Stalin's individual paranoia, that is true, but only to an extent, his paranoia was being booyed forward and and and uh allowed to lun rampant by a general desire, an incohate desire within the bolshevic party to punish itself for what it had done. they all thought it was necessary, they all thought that the the that starving all those peasants was necessary for the greater project, and they and they felt felt that the results prove that, look, look at the industrial capacity we're building, look at what we're doing, we're creating a viable alternative to the the west here without bare hands every day, yes people are dying. blah blah blah, but we're doing it, and we're doing it, they're doing it right in front of our face though, and they're we're doing it to people who we consider comrades, the the the British did the same thing, but they did it to people who they didn't consider people, so they never sweated it for a minute, they had already pre-washed their minds of any guilt associated with that, so there's no political purges, there's no political violence at the heart of the British Empire, and we get to call it free because of that. because of the untroubled consciousness of its bourjois and ruling class. Oh, congratulations, you are actual reptiles. That's why they're the most reptilianne country now. In Russia though, because this they had taken power, they thought they were going to get a world revolution, they didn't, but they taken power and they're holding the rains of history now, what are they gonna do with it? They want to bring about the socialist utopia, they really do, because validates everything else about them, the way the idea of heaven validated everything that the medieval lords did, and they're closer to the truth here, because we've gotten to the root, we've gotten to class, we've gotten to the creation of a real consciousness capable of being the god head, of actually being god, but what that means is when you kill all the peasants to make me you did it, the market didn't do it, god didn't do it by making them brown, you did it, that guilt had to go somewhere, and sure Stalin made people paranoid, but they wanted someone, they wanted someone to pay for it, to pay for what they had done, because they felt bad about it, even though they felt like it had to happen, so that's the case, it had to happen, but it was wrong, then if someone needs to pay, by definition, it's not me, I was the one who made it good. I was the one contributed to the good part of it, all the bad part, I can imagine being somebody else's fault, and I could point to them, and even if I know there's no trockers, even if I know that there's that's all made up, I can still feel better about myself, there has to be this like coming to reckening with the reality of making uh modernity, concentrate the pain of modernity, before it was going to get all over the place, we're going to concentrate it more on black slaves and fucking white irish, and we're going to let the fact that we're doing it to one scare the other ones and enrage the other ones into a political alliance with capital that will cut its own throat, and now we're heading. towards another ritual of violence, because we can't contain the contradictions and we can't give out the treats, we got to find someone to blame, and so the cultural revolution is that in China. It's it's 30 million fucking people died in like two years from 58 to 61, two or three years, that the the old thing you see in like a like an old movie or a uh like black and white sitcom, trying to get the kid to eat, they'll say they're starving people in China, before people said Africa, they said China, and that's because of the great lead forward, uh, so he said the soviets were dealt an impossible hand, I'm saying that, see why, this is what I don't understand, I'm literally saying they were dealt in impossible hand, if they'... wanted to stay in power, they had to do that, why do they have to stay in power? because they had convinced themselves that they were the center of socialism and they weren't, socialism is everywhere, socialism needs to press everywhere, yes it needs a material base, but one that builds the charnel house of capitalism cannot be that one, again, how are they going to reason any differently? people on the periphery freaks might like trotssky didn't, but he was too much of a fucking his problem was that he couldn't... uh believe in anything, he he couldn't make any sort of faithful choice, and that paralyzed him, and that's where we all find ourselves, which is why everybody is spiritually trotskite, even if they hate Traskiits, why do they hate them, because they're looking in the mirror, because you're quezy with what has to be done, the georgian thug wasn't quezy about anything, because he was the Georgian thug, but the party was not georgian thugs, the party was people in the middle of the of of of of their humanity, people the middle of everybody, people with hearts, and they needed to make sense of it. It's like they need to make sense of killing 30 million peasants in the 50s and so then there's a cycle of a purge of that guilt and then the generation that is purchased that but in building that state with the death in the 50s Mal creates the structures that capitalism in China will emerge from, the state-owned enterprises and also the healthy rural population that will then work in those state owned enterprises that Deng is able to operate after the cultural revolution. which means that when the bill comes due in the in the 80's, really in the 70s, but in the Soviet Union it was put off a little bit uh by the fact they were a oil exporting nation, but by the 80's it's it's it's hit hard in both places and they respond different ways because you have the anti-nationalists uh who buy... after the civil war uh or I'm sorry after World War II ended up having to reformulate a new nationalism, the great great patriotic war nationalism in order to make sense of that, because you couldn't use socialism anymore, it had been belief in it had been extinguished by the conflict, by the blood, by the monstrosity. China built the state or enterprises and because it did not have the centrifocal force to pull away from it, which is what happened with the Soviets, all of their per parts that helped feed blood to the heart we're being were pulling away. there was none of that in China. what they did instead is, this is in the fourth chapter, the the central state starts sending out, starts setting up these state-owned enterprises in the regions and then local bureaucratic elite take them over and and they get incredibly uh sweet deals on sweet on uh loans from the state bank the... just given everybody loans and they uh use those loans uh to build these big unprofitable state-owned enterprises but that further belief in the state because now the state is actually responsible for giving people things like jobs in these new industries. people are rising up by connecting to the and and greater uh accelerating capitalism in this in in China, but of course it also creates we talk about... last week it creates a vast amount of inequality within China and this uh so the fourth chapter is pretty interesting so fourth chapter is uh it takes the question of did China really was is China really the reason that we uh that there has been any progress on global inequality that's because people want to say people who love capitalism like to point out oh global uh poverty has dropped in the 20th century uh and the response to that. is that's pretty much all in China uh and so this this chapter says so how much does China actually contribute to world um inequality and he points out that there's two forces at work and that's the thing all of these questions have within them these dialectical relationships uh and and so with China you have the fact that uh so China it de gets more per capita in. like people have more uh in income relative to the global mean in China, so that means that global inequality goes down, but within China there is places that get more funding and more. um development and places that get less and the rural places get less, the the this is this is a slow motion version of what happened in the 30s in Russia, but now in these autonomous state-owned enterprises that make profit and are getting foreign direct investment, but they're unequally distributed, so you have this inequality within China that is increasing. uh, and once China gets to a point where it's above a uh the global middle for economy, once it becomes an above average wealthy nation, all of a sudden any further inequality change in China makes the global inequality greater, uh, and also like China in some respects empowers. um developing nations by being able to sort of negotiate on their behalf in things like the WTO and the IMF like for example uh there was talk in the Bush years of getting developing countries to finally scrap their agricultural subsidies which is something that uh the Washington consensus demands but China has held up any agreement along those lines by insisting that uh that uh core countries like Europe and the United States they have to get rid of their agricultural. first and also, and that just scraps it because that's not happening, those are two powerful constituencies. um, so he goes through the evidence, says in some ways, so that's one way that it helps them, but also it contributes to the tribute economy of the American empire, and it it contributes through its purchase of us bonds by American military at Germany, that enforces raw export models that undermine local uh the robustness of like local industrial economies and therefore mass uh uh powerful in negotiating with developed countries so it's it's a push and pull on the on the whole he comes down on saying uh probably broadly has china has been uh has reduced global inequality but while helping contribute to the system that is you know perpetuating inequality everywhere and therefore in some respects and in some other places distributing that pain basically, because you can't have just development, it's coming somewhere at someone's expense, some uh area, some uh part of our ecological and biological matrix is is paying for it, and the more it pays somewhere, the more unstable the relationship there to the center becomes and then you get full uh destabilization, so uh the fifth chapter. is about uh whether or not China represents a uh real difference the different uh political economy than the western American capitalism that it you know trades with and he basically says no uh the United States and China have a totally symbiotic relationship uh the US uh pumps up uh credit and uh borrows money. uh in order to pump up credit to you know buy our arms and maintain our military supremacy, allow our reserve currency or our currency to be the world reserve currency uh impose the actual like sinues of the world supply chain empire uh and in return China uh suppresses consumption uh in their country and uh they they they take the debt uh they make the stuff or assemble the stuff uh and they... keep consumption at the household level low, because in this dynamic, one part of it is overconsuming, the other part must underconsume, so that's the relationship that China and the United States have, and the reason that's able to persist is because of the differing political systems. United States, yes, like they broke, they they suppress wages too, like the United States government has been suppressing wages for as long as the Chinese have, uh, but the differences is that... they have extended credit to allow for consumption to b, china does not do that, they keep the wages low, but there is no concomminant easy credit, so consumption stays low, and on the other side, us consumption is up, that even flow, that's that's not, that that cannot change uh if we don't change uh structurally, and uh, one of the big reasons that he insists that there will not be some chinese internal crisis just like the US is uh is if it recalibrates this relationship, because if it's unstable in one direction for too long, like with any capitalist system, any extractive system, the second law thermodynamics kicks in and you are getting less out of more effort, and the only way to change that is to reintroduce movement in the system, and that means Chinese consuming more, and this is crucial, Americans consuming less, like I said, America. our political system means we can agree together to keep wages low, but since we've defined uh self-expression by consumption, we're going to have to offer them the possibility of consuming, and so whoever is in charge, the other top side that wants more power for their own membership, can just say we'll give you more consumption and then they'll vote for you, so the there is this pressure to keep things in a relationship, even if it totally industrializes and the American economy and tears the heart of the mid-west, it's the only way to stay in power. China because they kept the party state, that uh, there's nowhere for that desire to go, no no constituency hat is there to say, hey, we're the alternative who will let you consume, so they keep it down, uh, and those things aren't changing, and if those things don't change, then the crisis will happen, because the they cannot reform internally, that is I think the the key. insight into this crisis stuff is that they cannot uh internally change because this people who stand it up structure it to keep their elite status uh perpetual and once they do that it means that in the future when conditions change and they need to change with them they can't do it they can't see the necessity they see it through a ideological uh buffer that just makes them double down on what they're doing. so yeah, that's his big uh, that's the end of the the big chapter in terms of his argument, is saying the US and the uh Chinese economies are totally interdependent at the level where uh, neither side can independently reorient their economies, uh, the the Chinese, and and here's the real thing, the really harbingers poorly, is that let's say the Chinese were able to. uh, we're let's say America was able to come to a point where we're actually voluntarily consuming less, where our political system allows us to consume less. now this is i think what like the fascists imagine they're going to do, i think that the America first like the real intellectual magadumb asses, the the dummies, the smartest dummies uh think they can do is they'll seize control the government and then by instituting all those awesome values they love, the epic American masculinity values they love. people will voluntarily consume less because now they have purpose, but what they have failed notice is that the very things that they're trying to reify are consumer choices, it is you are giving me the freedom to express my identity, but it is not my identity is a member of the German Volk, it is a member at the end of history, at the end of the pring... pushed through over time, that becomes the marks of a consumer cycle, so you you will only enshrine a consumer fascism that will destroy itself, it's going to have to go to war to try to push out boundaries, because that's the only way that any class society, a consumer-based society, where consumption is identity and consumption is freedom, definition class based because you're fighting over surplus extracted not through a collective endeavor but through individual imiseration so the chinese own a ton of our stock of our treasury bills because it's a it's it's the closest thing to ready money it's the closest thing to fully convertible and and and guaranteed American dollars. which is the safest uh investment, why? because of the military, so that's why we get to work our things out erotically instead of having it imposed, like instead of something having coming into our like neurotic political arguments and saying knock that shit off, we get to have these breakdowns in public, because we have the guns, so one way or another we're going to keep consuming, our model will be consumption until the nukes drop, so that means that they cannot even move the lever in China, but say they'... say they could, say something happened in america that led them, led Americans to consume less voluntarily, or maybe not, maybe there just way fewer americans, i don't know uh but not so many that you know a crucial block is knocked out of the global order because if that happens then you're back to localized power just like after the Roman empire you can't really talk about global capitalism anymore you can't talk about global anything anymore um and we're talking about can China like avoid this and transcend this that's that's what the open question is uh but that would mean they have to consume more and my god what is China consuming more look like what is look. how America consuming more looks like, what is China consuming? Consider something that uh Hang points out in this book, uh, one of the marks, one of the marks of increased um prosperity and the rising of a middle class in China, is sure automobile pur uh purchasing, but also meat consumption. Meat used to be the reserve of the aristocrats. In Europe, for example, the diet of a pesant uh was. almost entirely grains, some like uh fruits and vegetables from foraging and stuff, but mostly like a starch, and meat was for rare occasions and and harvest festivals and stuff, whereas the diet of aristocrats was basically exclusively meat, it was almost entirely meat, this is the public ritual of surpluss destruction and consumption that we're talking about that realifies power. so what does that mean? what does China eating more meat mean? my god, like yes, there are technological fixes theoretically to a lot of these issues, but they're not happening fast enough. it is, it's clear that we are past the point where we need to collectively put the brakes on, but we can't everybody has because we have a brick put on the uh uh the accelerator, everybody has a brick on the accelerator, including China. Yeah, like mat mad iglesius's book is basically this, but he says, hit the hit the hit the thing even harder, but of course what's dumb about him is he doesn't understand, it's already at the at the fucking ground, guys like iglesius, these fucking uh, these couriers, their entire thing is seeing what's happening and explaining afterwards why it's good and it's okay, it's fine, it's fine actually, don't worry about it, that is the message always, don't worry about it, that is the eternal message of the the glaci. of the world, don't worry about it. hey, what about this uh fraugulent crypto guy trying to buy the entire democratic party? don't worry about it. he's an effective eltrist. his parents were consequentialist moral philosophers. so it's like, hey, look at this dynamic that's going to eat the world, matt. oh, we just need more Americans because of our can do spirit and ingenuity, we'll solve all these big problems. now, more likely, it'll crack up, but what does that look like? that's the big question. and I think this book helps me further believe that it will be as it always is, it'll be a breakdown. Power will not go away though, the apocalypse that we imagine will not be there, there will just be zones of exclusion. Like I said, the apocalypse already exists, it's it's a mile from my house, the apocalypse exists, it's called skidrow california, skidrow Los Angeles, that is, that's it, you want to know what the apocalypse is, there it is, you can go look at it, you can walk there, you can go and help people there, or you can gack at them, that's the... it's a little display item for the apocalypse and it'll just be a process of of of of capital retreating to redouts of power everywhere and the guy like iglesius thinks i'm going to always be in the center so it'll be okay as long as i can explain why it's okay so he at the end is the same as the fascists is the same as the estates who say uh fuck democracy let's do turbo techno feudalism and i want to be deciding who i get watch through the the CCV camera as they're doing the drone strikes at the border and I get to call it an epic. Iglesius is wanting the same thing, he's just going to be, he's going to think all that stuff's horrible, but my god if you could just see the green shoots here on the uh, the terminator, grand execution council, you know, the the blood council is coming up with some amazing new uh fixes for uh, the tyranical uh regime of occupational inner cities, so all of their job is to tell you all as well, because the people they talk to, you know, if they all did say no, it would be a problem, and there are people who are excited by that idea and the people were terrified by it, and i really got to make people like confront if you're really scared of the thing breaking down, are you scared of being imiserated or are you scared of uh having to watch more imiseration? And if the answer is to watch more miseration, that means that you have the power to not do that, you know, it just means changing your relationship. to uh what feels good, and it really is, it is, like now we have a politics that's entirely lidinal, but it's entirely based on selfish individual pleasure, no short term, give me something to give me dopamine to get me through the day, which is outrage, which is self-rightteousness, which is fantasies of domination, and then there's the hard work of politics that make that that has a lot of tidium around it, but also has moment. of real connection and meaning and that cumulatively is what defines uh politics and that is what we all have to redefine if we're going to approach what's coming for any of us and what we have to deal with every day with a sense of presence and purpose. okay so the last chapter is about the coming crisis and how is china and be able to change it, and I kind of already went over that, because that's the chapter where he says, the only way that uh China is able to even stave off a significant and state legitimacy imperiling crisis, is if it does this rebalancing towards uh consumers um consumption, which is why he says they have to liberalize politically, because that will provide pressure to make people uh be able to consume more, but of course you know that's just deepening. trench, that's just accelerating everything, like that is, that is, the accelerationist nicklandian thing is, yeah, this is good, crashing into an abridge abuntment in a Lamborghini is the best way to go, and i simply say the underlying premise there is again of the terror of repose, the terror of of stillness because of the presence of guilt, but if can be made transparent by awareness of the love that is expressed first to theself through forgiveness, and then outward to all. and that's happening and it will continue to happen and everybody will be saved even if they fall through the cracks. that's what i believe. there's no decision that's wrong in the full fullness, but here's the thing, the reality of that, this is what Luther thought, that compels you towards uh, that compels you towards the right thing to do, because without consequences then what is the thing to do? the thing to do, what makes you feel best? is to feel love, that is the thing that feels best. all other feelings that we might enjoy are just attempts to um to make up for and patch up a lack of love, but it doesn't work, that's why you need more and more, that's why you you will dig your own grave. so like this feels like a moment of suspension. but those moments are where you are you have the if you have the possibility and not everyone does because like i said i'm in one relationship to reality because i don't have to do a lot of unpleasant things if i don't want to, like physically unpleasant like demanding, i don't have a boss, so it's like that's why i am still motivated by this fear of falling from this thing i become addicted to, but i also... don't move frantically to try to shore it up, i don't move to a compound because i don't want to do anything that is motivated by a false reifification of uh consequences that don't exist, and that is that's the aubrey mclendon nickland thing is good old neon, like if if i cannot imagine uh reunion i will make it happen through action, i will i will negate all of those questions by creating the one undeniable act we can ever do, which is to end it on our own terms and then buying it on our own terms we we are reconciled like fucking uh mots hitting flame but in the process what are we doing what are we leaving in our wake by doing that and that's that's that question is what chases us to that point that question. uh is what drives the pedal to the metal, but if it's if there's no one really chasing you, then there's no reason to to to annihilate yourself. so yeah, i i sit here, i do my work, such as it is, which is very pleasurable to me, intellectually stimulating and i get to be with people that i i love and i get to do things that make me feel like i making other people's lives better in the personal sense, like you know, reaching my hand out when i can, and there's that shuren that's like, what else, what if this is it, but you know, I think the key is just being able to reconcile yourself to where you are in every given moment of your life, and the thing is you will lose track all the time, holding on to it is impossible, the way is not the way, but every moment has the potential to be a moment of reflection, where whatever amount of string you've pulled in you'll be able to drop. and that that is the wiping of the flight and that is like confession was horrib was was uh reviled by the lutherans because like it's another scam service of the church that you don't need, but the cycle of being able to repent is meaningful, a cycle of repentance, because we're always moving through space and time and and encountering it and and losing our bearings, but coming back is easy if we know. that forgiveness exists, so I got off the track a lot, but that's the that's the review of the book, and I would be open to reading something else that's more uh bullish on China as alternative, but it would have to be very focused on G's regime in specific particular, because the general trend that he sketches of the Chinese political economy up until G cu It's kind of a little dated at this point, especially considering all the stuff that's happened in the relatively recent past, the acceleration, he talks about belton road being initiated and it's really accelerated in the years since he wrote it, so uh, I'd be interested in seeing that, I'm not going to read the governance of China, no thank you, uh, but I i can't escape the belief that China is fully imbricated in a a global machine, it it it still has no uh underlying logic. uh outside of development through the channels that are at it the control of the specific constellation of elites that make it up and that's what they're doing. now there is this like refreshing and renewal coming from below and you're seeing some executions of of of uh finance years and stuff, but since China cannot quit the US dollar, and this is a key thing, without cutting their own throats the... cannot build an alternative to the global US capitalist system. what is what is the response to this? if anyone has one, i'd be interested in it. in order for China to call the shots in a meaningful way, right? let's take this as a silligism, they would have to be the world reserve currency, right? they would have to have the world reserved currency, they would have to have control, effective control of the world reserve currency, but in order to do that, they would have to get rid of the capital controls. in their money market, and if they do that, that is the death warrant of the uh, communist party of China as an independent uh, power repository, so okay, you've done it, you're now at charge, you just, you can only persist in the model that the US has created, you can only deepen it as the us did to the the system that uh, that the British created, so if anyone has answer to that or a book that or an article, honestly an article would be nice, I read, but yeah, uh, something that just takes into account, J's attempt to reassert party control, and how it's going to deal with just that fundamental contradiction at the financial level. but again, people are like, they don't like when you say that because they need someone to come in and save the world, they need somebody to keep this global system going, and what I keep taking, what I keep trying to emphasize is that whether it collapses or not, the future is not within its walls, the future is going to be built by the people who are being sharpened by necessity, but and and what necessity means when you are bereffed of the technological uh uh matrix that we have all embedded ourselves in is each other. It's all we got man, in order to have the Chinese takeover, they would have to be able to coordinate all of these global capitalist economies from a center, and coordinate their actions through policies that would redistribute dramatically resources from... from the west and north to the south, there is no constellation of power outside of China that would acced to that without just going to the uh final without sweeping over the negotiating table and going to war. what leverage can China have to enforce any kind of changes to political economy outside of themselves that redistribute in that direction. what we're talking about is how do you make voluntary reduction of consumption in the west? that is the challenge. and if anyone has any work that argues that chairman G is up to the challenge of peacefully because if if they resist then game's over right we get that that resolves in a nuclear war that's over uh short of that you you're talking about a to one degree or another peaceful sure there will be social to ferment in specific countries but there will not be an apocalyptic confrontation peaceful transition more or less of uh consumption uh from the west to the perfery, not as consumption, this is the key thing, but as uh development, as as resource development, I'm sorry as uh as uh industrial development, not just producing stuff for the market, but producing stuff to uh essentially reterraform the planet. basically reducing consumption everywhere and redirecting resources to yeah retarraforming the planet. now that is a that's a thing that could happen and i feel like the fucking larus as and much of crackpts that they are, they at least recognize that, like even though they're trapped in the same nationalist measma as every other American political current, and that makes them blows them off course. uh there essential recognition that you would need some sort of global infrastructure project, a globalized balton road to uh manage the coming crisis is correct, but the reason they look like crank pots is because that's impossible, but that's not because they're crazy, it's not because they're crazy to think that's what a thing we should do, they're crazy to think it's a thing we could do, but that honestly makes everybody who's still invested in uh politics at like the national level, oh also even more delusional, because if the loral land bridge and global belt and road is is impossible, what the fuck are you doing caring about who becomes president, so it's like you have to reckon with the larus because they have, they see the outlines of any viable. future for the human civilization as we understand it and want to keep it, and you got to reckon with that and the same, well what now? and to me, the thing that allows me to live with that reality is the knowledge that the the the fucking green shoots will be appearing elsewhere, and also that the rush project is doomed, because the fact that that... is the initial reaction of everyone who has not been deeply indoctrinated into a specific esoteric, internet-based, heuristic of the universe, tells you everything you need to know, because the distance from reality is clear to see if you are not motivated otherwise, but that's true of other things through different lenses, like i said the egglas are just as delusional as the lurushies, but because their delusion is more widely shared and generated in the media and necessary and generative of the media, it gets to be called normal, but it's just as fucking whacky, man, okay, if the chinese uh "if the chinese do do cold fusion then all bets are off obviously, like that, but the thing is that's that is the black swan that everyone is sort of depending on, and elon Musk represents it in human form. Elon Musk's entire scam was predicated on a whole on on absorbing the necessary social belief in this uh, rationalized Messiah, like..." Messiah as technology rather than as you know a human spiritual awaken, which is the end result of the dead machine that we worship, ripping itself free of humanity and becoming all powerful, and musk is like it's human charapis, and now it's cracking because the the fantasy is losing its ability to be sustained at every level, the scales are falling, but in what direction and how will people respond, we're terrified, and that's and that and that little. on twitter was a representation of that, we're terrified and we uh want to be uh delivered and the musk worshippers, the dead enders are the ones no, like the god is not failed, we can still do this, but the people who don't believe in him are desparing, are even more desparing because there's they haven't replaced it with anything, there's just this hope that something. will emerge and that's kind of why i think twitter isn't going anywhere because that's such a powerful load bearring structure of the attention economy that more than delivering any specific discrete message which is what people get to focused on when they talk about twitter as a propaganda machine it's the structure itself that is propagandistic but it is it's a vacuum that i don't think uh can last. It has to be failed because we are too distant from one another to put that newly uh unleashed energy to better use, not individually, not well, not doom to that, as a group, we will tend to the center of us find another thing to do, because the center of us is hollow, because the center of us has been hollowed out, and it's not our fault and we will not be punished for it, we will not be eternally doomed for it, we will... learn, we will all learn every lesson we needed to. okay, i feel like we got somewhere with this one, feel like this was very productive, uh, i hope it wasn't too robot sounding. All right, feeling good in the neighborhood. All right, I will switch mikes for the next one just to see if that helps. All right, talk to everybody later. I'm going to go make. some soup.
