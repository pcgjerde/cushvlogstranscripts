 Oh, I love this armature, it's so convenient, there I am, rock me like a hurricane, hi guys, I'm back, it's Cushie's world tour. or I guess basement tour, backyard tour rather, but he never really left anywhere, I'm pretty convinced that all those Joey videos take place in the exact same fucking the the parking lot of the same awful giant mall, and he just drives around and goes to the different places and gets a thing to eat it there, he's never even left this, whatever fucking county he lives in, fucking Joey, what a fraud, it was such a uh non-shock when I found out that he was a big trub supporter, like really the guy whose job is to stuff him. uh for the cackling amusement of a bunch of rubes on youtube likes Donald Trump, I can't believe it. What would he have to see in Trump? What would a guy like Joey's World Tour have to see in common with Trump? That's absurd. Uh, so the department of homeland security is just abducting people off the streets in Portland, huh? That's happening now. That's the next. that's escalation, that's pretty wild, you got to say that's that's and that is an escalation for sure, and I'm seeing a lot of people were saying like, all right, this is the fascism, you know the fascism we've been worrying about, it's here, and I mean, while this is certainly an escalation and authoritarianism, I think once again the word fascism kind of obscures the reality of what we're dealing with, because I mean if you're just using fascism as a syniquinon for authoritarianism, then fine, whatever, but if you're trying to describe the phenomenon of a... of a terminally critical capitalism, a dying capitalism trying to protect itself by uh creating a a uh nationalist uh right populist movement uh this is an example of that uh this is an example of why we're actually in a scarier situation than that because I honestly think one of the reasons people like to think that fascism is what's we're dealing with is because it imagines that they'll get to fight it again they'll get to go in the streets like the red front fighters did. they'll get to they'll get to be, they'll get to put their stamp on history and say like even if they win, even if this is the fourth riche, I i'm not going to go down as one of those uh, one of Hitler's willing executioners, or or one of the good germans who followed orders, I'll go down there as like one of the one of the first communist to go into the fucking uh concentration camps after the night of the long nives and the enabling acts, but this is actually kind of scarier because because this isn't the cops, this isn't the authorities, this isn't capital sending out street thugs to stop people from uh from uh protesting, it's first using the existing police structure to uh beat down the initial excitement and enthusiasm of the the protesters and then as the protests kind of lost their coherence, they didn't necessarily stop happening, but they were no longer part of a coherent movement with coherent goals. uh, even if you know you can say, oh there's there's a political track, there is, but at the level of like the individual, I mean it doesn't seem to me there's a lot of coordination between when cities have protests or what they're demanding, and I'm not blaming anyone for that, that's the nature of protest, that's the nature of politics in the late in 21st century America, but what part of the reason, part of the result of that is that we are then demobilized, and it then what we're seeing now is they'll just grab people want. by one, they'll literally pull them away when they're not part of any greater group, when they don't have to worry about any kind of uh consequences for doing so and then have everybody individually suffer the trauma of this police uh uh tactic, i mean i'm sure a lot of these people are probably just they've probably already been let out after being questioned, but the the psychological impact has already been been felt, they've experienced like what it would be like to be one of the disappeared in Chile or... Argentina, and if they're good left, they sure shit know about that, it's like how they fake executed Dostoyevski in the Gulog to scare him straight, and it worked by the way, which is a funny thing, by turning him into an ecstatic Christian, but but by cutting us off from the herd one by one and traumatizing us individually in a way that won't afford us a chance to react in the moment, that's how this is, that's how they're going to, that's how they're going to establish. the physical perimeter around remaining centers of capital. That's why we need, that's why we need an organized counter movement as soon as possible, and uh, I saw this today, I mean, I know that we've talked about how like the question of abolishing the police, and you know, dealing with uh the fact that there is a genuine need for a police force to exist, for monopoly to be violent, for violence to be monopolized by the state, for some enforcement of of laws in order to maintain basic social stability, under capitalism, which we still... live under, but also they need to have a long-term vision to to end it, you know, those things are, that's a real argument, but something like DHS, which is the people doing this, it's not the local uh Portland cops, it's department of home and security, abolishing DHS is a fucking slam dunk, that should just be an unambiguous demand, because it's not necessary in any way, it's just a coordinating, it's just one of those fucking coordinating fusion centers for distribution of authoritarian violence, they prioneered during the phoenix project and then brought home and that's why you know the degree to which the police have to be restrained and have their power reduced which is significantly disarming them is one of the big things that should be demanded because a lot of these cops will quit if they don't have to get to have guns and then the ones who would join would be less insane uh and of course you have to worry about the... question, but I think that could be managed uh in the context of radical uh redistribution of like securing the base of the economic structure of America, removing the the windowing horror, the grinding, ceaseless uh traverse on the fucking uh on the conveyor belt towards the the smashing machine. fucking temple of doom that we're actually on, like diverting from that will reduce a lot of that uh, it'll reduce the need for policing, it will reduce uh the the danger of the ex-cops left to their own devices and will make the jobs of the remaining and new cops easier, but i mean if you're not going to abolish the policing. in society, and you can't do that until capitalism is finished, and I don't think anybody has a realistic plan to end capitalism in the near future, that means they have to be realistic. You have to ask what is going to work, what's going to, what's a possible ask that can be pushed towards becoming that non-reform reform or even if you hate electoralism, that thing that makes people say that's enough to fight over and join your cause, which they are are not enough of right now, and to me that's the number one question. and that's what i furiates me about so much discourse is so little of it is about that, so little discourse is about how to get more people, it's a metadiscourse on like what the perfect person to get is, because it's all about embodying an ideal type and then measuring people against that, but they're not there yet, so they don't have the markers you're looking for, but that doesn't mean that they're inherently on the wrong side, that does mean that they have bad faith, it means that they have not imbibed whatever you're trying to sell, and that means you have to make it in some way uh, something they would want to try, it can't just be tonic of of uh of of of guilt and and taking responsibility and all that shit, buse why would anyone sign up for that without an upside, because they don't already accept the undergirding assumptions that you do. but yeah, no, uh, the DHS is terrifying, uh, and the ability, the amount of information, I mean, the NHS is a whole other deal, or the NSA, rather, you, we kind of all forgot about it, but the nightmare from the movie anime of the state where the government can hack on to your computer or phone at any moment is true, they can get in, they can watch this webcam, of course they could do that anyway, but they could watch it when I'm taking a shit. they could read every email, it's just i mean really the argument against like why you shouldn't be freaked out about that is essentially well that's so much data that they can't really find anything and that's true, they're not going to just dip their hands in and find out that you uh you know bought black uh dark web uh dmt or something they're going to they're going to poke it at the specific people and then they're going to find the information that way and so... this thing of of DHS probably going off of data they got from the NSA going in and plucking up people who two weeks earlier like spray painted acab on... the side of a building, all the stuff that they that DHS uh came up with as justifications, the the lawlessness of uh of Portland boiled down to fucking graffiti charges from weeks earlier, like nothing like an emergency, someone asks if you should read Reaganland or Nixonland first, you should read before the storm first, there's four books, you should read them in order, because it's a it's a story that unfolds over time. before the storm, nixon land, invisible bridge, and then Ragon Land, because you can't really understand uh, Nixon unless you understand uh, water, uh, gold water, and the pressure that gold water represented, the new type of conservative, I was talking about last week, or uh, or earlier this week, the sun. belt which was dominated by oil and natural gas money and uh aerospace and defense contracting from from orange county to texas basically that's where the new money in the republican party came from where the new ideology was born uh goldwater represented it and then later uh it came into fruition in orange county california aerospace and defense uh hotbet uh, I mean, and it was of course this wildly uh, hypocritical movement of people in industries, all of which completely dependent on government larges, like Orange County was built by the defense uh industry, that's direct government money spent, uh, natural gas and oil dependent on the oil depletion allowance, I mean that's why they bought uh LBJ and a million other politicians is to maintain the the delicate balances of tax rebates and incentives they got that made it worth it. to risk pumping for oil uh and then of course big ranchers who complain about having to play grazing fees for land that was entire that was only accessible to them because of the deprivations of the us government that fucking disposses native peoples and created infrastructure for their behalf and it's it's it was essentially a movement of sore winners, the ungrateful winners of America, the people who did so well in that post war immediate post war period that they immediately decided that they weren't doing well enough and blamed everybody else who wasn't as smart, they applied some of that calvinism, that deep American calvinism to say, why isn't everybody where i am, why isn't everybody with their lovely uh house and my lovely pool and my lovely wife, well it must be because they're insufficiently american, they're too Jewish, they're too, they have too much ethnicity to them uh, they're they they don't have enough american sstick to it of got blah blah, purely just self- flattering. mean fucking Barry Goldwater inherited a family uh uh a family department store and his grandfather only went to Arizona to sell uh military goods to the army and and and but they didn't feel that because that kind of provision is by the way that we structure things invisible because the people at the top are not being given right like we think of welfare as as this distribution downward to the poor uh and we think of uh people at the top paying taxes or or uh and giving to the state to give to that person, when in reality that's all money being pulled upward, the state exists to upwardly redistribute money away from the people who produce it, the people produce value to the peopletically squat over them, like vampires, and so so I talked the other day about ideology and how some disagreements within the republican party are not. ideologically they're informational, ideological, they're informational, and somebody asked what i meant by that, and i want to say first that that's not quite true, there's no such thing is informational that is not ideological, but the differences, the arguments are along a different axis than the people in them think they are, but anyway, this is to say, so this new sunbelt. conservativism emerges right, and what it's hostile to is the internationalism of the establishment republican party that was dominated by wall street finance capital, banks, the lenders who had and and banks are who you borrow money from if you're these people, if you're people from the the sun coast, so you actually see them not even as your your friends, but your enemies, as you're exploiters, and the government exists to help the banks exploit you, even though you're benefiting from the... person gets to gets to feel like a like a fucking moch for even deigning to get uh the doll, they have to feel like there's so much shame among among poor people about getting handouts, even though it's it's it's the scraps left over from after the fucking orgy of uh upward redistribution to the jacko-like parasitic upper class, but that's not how they that's not how the ideology exists to make them feel, because ideology exists to make poor... people okay with what's up with them with their lives makes it it's basically to to asswage the uh the misery of the poor by making them feel that they have a coming in some way or that they can make it if they just apply themselves they won't be that way anymore and then for rich people it uh tells them that they deserve what they have that's what ideology exists for for people for rich people to do is to make you feel like this state of affairs in which i have wildly more than other people into a disgusting degree is justified, and uh, and that's because everybody's alienated in capitalism, but the alienation is different, it's some degree of alienation of self, the way the poor people and uh and the uh working class people are exploited of their time, their species being, that like they're alienated from the time of their, their actual existence, rich people are alienated from everybody else, rich people are alienated wildly from the human species, they're they're they live essentially separate and that is also an alienation and it's like a pebble in the brain and it has to be awaged and ideology is there to assuage both of those things, both for the purpose of maintaining the system, they're the they are the the ideology and culture and the culture that spawns it are like capitalism's uh um what do you call white blood cells it's the uh immune system that's what i was thinking capitalism is immune system social system is ideology through culture, and both at the top and at the bottom, it's supposed to keep people where they are, and keep people not trying to change the arrangement, so what that means though is that at the top, ideology eventually become so overwhelming uh, because of the difference between the world as it exists and the world as you think it should, like for example, I talk about how like conservatives really think America is great. America's great, it's the land of opportunity, it's the blessed country because I'm here and I'm doing well, it's it's it's self-worship just like the the version of God is them too, it's all worshipping their ego, they don't know that, but that's what they're doing, they're worshipping their ego, by by by making it equivalent to God and to America, but then America is filled with suffering and misery and social conflict and the culture, oh my god, we keep getting our values spit at us and we keep losing all this respect, and we're not being validated by the very thing that we think is the greatest thing that exist. on earth, how can that be, and so ideology exists to make us answer that question without saying capitalism, without saying you are being pulled away from all humanity and everything you thought you valued is being dissolved into fucking ether by the the rationalizing madness of capitalism, defining all relationships between everything through transaction, robbing everything of sacredness, spirituality, social meaning, anything. we are desacralizing the world, but you believe in spirit, at least you think you do, but you can't admit that it's capitalism, so what is it? oh, it's the cultural marxist, blah blah blah, and what that does is over time, because reality doesn't fit with your ideology, you start ignoring the parts of reality you don't like, not even on purpose, you are, you you you just glide over them when you uh encounter them, which means even though capitalism is rule of of the uh work ruling class of of the the bourgeois of the of the ownership class uh it's not rulership of the of the ruling class according to their interests, it's to the um to their understanding of those interests, they're they're they are operating in their best interests as they understand them, and everyone's understanding is limited, and the more out of touch you get with reality becoming by being rich, the more you have to fill in the gaps. your understanding of the world with ideology, that's what fills all the cracks and keeps the the ship from sinking, and that leads that eventually you're not operating with a with a real understanding of the world, and that means that you're no longer operating in your best interests, and that is the war within the capitalist class that we're seeing played out at the political level. right now, like Trump was the final victory and takeover of the party by those people who perulsten documents their... rise to power in the republican party in his books, those people who were uh small bourgeois, local manufacturers and small business owners and and uh the the more success full uh aerospace and and defense uh professionals and stuff uh them saying my country isn't what i want it to be anymore those damn wall street uh uh fat cats are are ruining uh are ruining capitalism instead of understanding the way that the people in wall street did they pulled all the first guys from oss from the wall street law firms because those things essentially already operated as espionage organizations, they were all over the world with information gathering such systems in order to figure out what the what the business conditions were all over the world, so they understood it away that the locally focused small bouux in America couldn't, that the only that the real game in town in the cold war was capitalism as a world system versus socialism is a world system or communism is a world system and as such we had to do things like build up the capacity of uh our foreign earthwile allies uh i mean personally that helps us like prevent a crisis of overproduction because that means someone is there to buy all of our stuff uh but it also means that they're less likely to fall to communism and they're stronger in their resistance to communism and we did everything we could to make that happen i mean the marshall plan, operation gladio, vietnam war, these are all parts of that. the the entire gamesmanship was maintaining uh maintaining access on on terms of the purchaser of third world uh raw materials in a post-colonial context, essentially reimposing colonialism uh through the market through the through the new IMF World Bank, Brenton Wood system, and then after that the petro dollar. They understood that because they faced outward. The small bourjois represented by now Trump did not, but they eventually took over the political body of the republican party, but they could had no control over the actual uh, momentum of of of world capitalism, independently of them, like they they gave up any, once they took over the political level, once they took over the levels of political power, they did, they gave up demanding control over the economic questions, because the early. the early versions of this like uh Robert opposed the Marshall plan, he said what are we doing giving all this money to the fucking Germans we just blew up and wall street represented by Eisenhower basically cowed him to keep him from the office in 52 because they're like hey Moron we don't want Europe to go communist you fucking dullard you Ohio fucking cheeseball you're too stupid to understand this but by the 80s Reagan carries out deregulation just like Carter was. just like Ford was, just like Nixon was, just accelerates the timeline of of turning every American city into a fucking bombed out wreck and then just filling it with cops, he didn't do anything about that, not a got, he didn't lift a finger, he cut taxes and he cut regulations, and he got that money flowing up north, you got he redistributed that shit up, but he didn't do a fucking thing about the larger questions of like the global economy in America's industry because it's all really about jobs and industrial capacity, that's what all this boils down to and and whether we're going to have a nationalist economy or not, and the more advanced elements like progress, as in understanding what they're actually fighting for, conservatives, understand that, and now there are democrats and now we're seeing the final war, it used to be within the republican party, now that they've defeated the republican party because the democrat party can only respond by going to the right with the republicans, as the republicans squeezed out the establishment like multilateral conservatives, got absorbed by the democrats, which of course is trying to also hold on to the left and we'll see how how well they do that in the fall, they're probably going to do well cuz everyone hates trump, but whether they're there for the mid-terms or something, i have a i have a feeling we're going to see just a accelerated version of obama all over again, uh, only he go, he wins, he only wins one term this time, so that's why ideology has to be. considered in every question and you cannot, like I see a lot of people uh, you have a very like stiff definition of like capitalist interests, and they'll say, oh, it's not in capital's interest to do x, y, or z, and that neglects a couple of things, it neglects one that even if you're talking about capital at its most self-aware, like international finance capital, they still have chinks in their armor, they still have things they don't know, they don't know, they still operate under ideological assumptions that blind them to the world around them, and then and then at that level they don't even have to really rub against to to to refine down these contradictions because they're supreme, they're masters of the universe, they touch nothing, but everything falls before. their hands so they'll never reform their contradictions, so they have their own defects in perceiving their best interest, which is which is a vulnerability, but then these people who are still captured by a lower level of ideological uh obfiscation, stuff that used to be for the rubes, but then you know everybody started watching the same TV shows, the old guys are tired and died and they got replaced by new old people whose brains been cooked by online in the way that older generations of rich guys. and all of a sudden they all really believe this shit and that's why you see trump do things that are like this is counterproductive, what is this? it's because he's not operating from correct premises, he wants to defend capitalism, but he doesn't know what it is, he wants to defend capitalism, but he thinks capitalism is the American economy, and that means he's going to make even though he's operating for the same assumptions as the global capitalists of the Democratic party, even though he's operating off the same assumptions, he's going to come to different conclusions. because he is at a lower level of awareness due to a greater level of ideological uh mystification at the very hap level uh you know like that's why i think that the the the lizard person metaphor that David came up with is very very useful and avocative i hate that it's been so uh tainted by associations with antisemitism because i don't think about Jews is not human, they're the they're like the Jewish tradition is the humanist tradition, like that's it's the thread of like self-awareness uh that run through all all the it marbles all western civilization and provides it with any kind of texture and contrast, it's it's it to try to anti-semitism is so stupid, i've talked about this, it's one of the it's one of the absolute number one brain fails, the way that you could just like quit taking the test and halfway through and just going out to off in the fucking bathroom, just pathetic lack of rigor to just stop at that, but uh, but lizards are people, they're reptiles, which means that they don't have a human, they don't have a human recognition of a recognition of one another as as anything the same, they view us as different as a different species, because if they didn't they wouldn't do what they do, very simple, to do what you do at that level of power, at that level of power, because at lower levels every, i mean everybody is exploiting to some degree, i mean i when i order takeout, i'm an exploiter, you know, when i when i buy a fucking computer program or or a cell phone filled with fucking uh slave labor produced cool tan, i am exploiting, everyone is exploiting to some degree or another, uh, but these people are only exploiting and and exploiting totally, they they have to have the same abstraction towards us that. we do towards you know uh towards like primates maybe and not even the smart ones like monkeys and that is reptilianing and the thing I just I think the thing that I would add to the metaphor is that they're not like a race of Reptilianns that if you do enough of their ritualized uh violence to other people. you will become a lizard, like if i was going to do a movie or something with like illuminati shit, i was going to have lizard people as the bad guy, it would not be they change faces because they're shape shifters, it would be they change faces cuuse they started off human, and then at some point they they they they hit an inflection point of a lack of empathy, which they needed to do to keep fueling their their behavior, to keep convincing themselves another fucking yacht or another fucking uh uh mansion or a private island or even another 100 years of life in a fucking computer disc could be worth the wholesale suffering that they unleash on the world. I'm going to play the stalit of David Ick again, still my favorite political song, I think this is the best song about politics ever written, and it's a fucking uh, and amazingly, it's acapella, and I don't think he ever released it on an album, I have stolen my girl. people keep saying the shunt, what is that? that was the last of her i've ever seen. knew that her heart was the purest of pure thorible suffering she would endure when she told of the lies and the hatred they spread and our blood of blond children was used in their bread so she opened her mouth to the cold lizard tongue that was speaking and code of the work to be done to make sure that the truthful are made to look mad, and the starving fed ashes for which they are glad, buse their brain was a camera they just had to look, and they said she was wise from the pictures she took, which were not unlike anything you'd ever seen, to be drowning in honey, awaking, a dream, secret. somebody had a really good question, i can't find it, so that's the one, it's really good, and uh, it basically anticipates pizza gate completely, and that was made in, that was made for the... John Kerry campaign for uh a collection of a cd of songs by different artists to defeat Bush, they had murders row on that album, David Burn, they might be giants uh, okay go, and they were the big hits, and they had that one on there, but that like he gets, he gets it in the central truth that the cute people also get to and that the reptile thing gets to, which is... to do what these people are doing to us, they have to be sick, like that is the big refrain among uh pizza gay people, right? these people are sick, and the thing is, it's true, but who they think is sick are like hollywood actors who make like $10 million dollars a year, you know, like they think it they think it's people, because that's how they view the war is through a cultural lens, to their minds like the guys they see on tv are the ones doing the evil because they live at that level of symbolic abstraction, politics is the TV. "the good guys are the good guys on tv, the bad guys are the bad guys on tv, so when they think of who is doing it, it's Robert de Nero, it's all the the fake news uh um anchors uh, it's all the actors, like you saw the thing today of all the all the friends people being uh uh secretly executed this month and turn and replaced with holograms, it's just it's not being able to see the forest for the trees, and so they recognize that in a world this awful, someone is responsible and that person is evil, that person has renounced human." in a significant way, in a morally meaningful way, but who that is, it's the bad people in tv, because that's where they live, and that's because most of them are boomers and that generation was the first to become fully mediated and it broke their brains and i think you can argue, i really do think that at some level, i mean obviously there's a lot of when you talk about whether or not a project, a state project a a human project succeeds or not, there are a lot of variables. and some of them are contingent, some of them are completely determined by by the the very structure of the situation that they find themselves in, and I guess you could say that like the emergence of first television and then the internet is one of those things that was going to happen eventually, but man, it really fucking threw a wrench in the gears, I got to say, I mean, you could argue that it it accelerated certain processess of like uh of empathy building across cultures, but at the cost of our ability to... function as social beings, which means that any like ideological or or or you know uh social shift is totally secondary to that basic reality that we've been scrambled, we've been turned into the dreaded pringle, we are pringles trapped in a tube. but I don't like saying that stuff too much cuuse she just sound like a cranky old man you know I was thinking last that's that's tells you where I have been since like the cops have started really cracking down on peoples last time I heard the helicopter that close I thought of good fellows and this time I thought of fucking fly uh apog. now and they attack the village. so yeah, and i know the younger people are so computer adept that. It's it's it's it's silly, you're essentially demanding the people go back to wearing top hats and crovats in terms of talking demanding behavior patterns that are that alien, I mean it's a completely different thing, it's a different life, it's a different reality, and uh, we've never, I don't think we've ever really had that, at least not that we can remember, like culturally. Yeah, really, infinite jest really did nail it, because infinite jest understood that that the uh solipcistic seduction of entertainment uh, is incredibly powerful, because it allows you to live a simulated version of the life that we are all thrust into unknowingly and unwittingly, but on our terms and without negative emotional consequences. and that is an insanely powerful seduction because life is suffering and it takes a lot of suffering to learn that that is all life is, and then it takes a lot of maturity and insight or luck to find yourself in a position to acknowledge, oh that means that I have to deal with that, I can't flee from it, it will come and get me, and people get to that realism. through repeated exposure to the traumas and horrors of life by seeking things and not getting them and then seeking things and then getting them and then having that not be sufficient after a while, the hedonic treadmill, we we spend enough time on it and we get to realize, oh this doesn't work, hopefully, not always, but it's a hopeful, it's a possibility and it's it's the degree that humanity is redeemable, it's the degree to which we go through that process, now is nowadays dang it, you can just opt instead for the internet, and I did it for years, that's how I know this is real, you can instead, oh, I'm not going to worry about that stuff, I'm not going to try to answer these questions of who I am, what I can do in the world, how I can apply myself, how I can apply my mind and my soul, to the world around me, how I can reach out to other people and potentially be rejected and dealing with that rejection and building a strong enough self-image that I can withstand rejection and and uh being able to repeat come back after defeats. and push myself, that's how we gain talent, that's how we gain wisdom, that's how we gain love, but it's also very scary, and the first time you fail, especially if it's when you're young, the pain is massive and overwhelming, and feels like it's the entire world, and if you have this possible alternative to that, where you get to build a life that has the same system of rewards, and challenges and and satisfaction, but on a symbolic, intellectualized you're a lot of people are going to take it, not saying you'll inevitably take it, but if that poption exists, a lot of people are going to take it, and it's dangerous, it's dangerous, because it means that people get into their adult years without ever trying anything, like getting by as little as they have. to and then using the internet and video games specifically as a big like organizer to channel that unfulfilled human energy, the remainder we have left that doesn't get alienated by capital, our our peace with ourself is the degree that we can we can challenge that in a way that makes us feel like we're doing something useful, useful to ourselves first and foremost, but then at a certain level we recognize that that is inextrably link to what's best for everybody, that those are one and the same, that we have to move any way we can to pursue that, and i think that realization comes and i think the internet makes it harder, but it also allows for things like, i mean i wouldn't be where i was, i it's it's it's very interesting, it's possible counterfactual because the internet made my life harder and worse for many years, and then even after the show was successful, I was also not very happy for a lot of time, I was anxious and I was uh un insecure in it, and uh, I, but I also don't feel like I'd be where I am now if it wasn't for that, and I wouldn't be able to go where I want to go from here if it wasn't for that, so it's all necessary, you know, I think that's that's the power of of uh recognizing how important it is to drop guilt, to not look backwards, beyond recognizing our mistakes so we don't repeat them, but then we have to drop any kind of negative association and guilt around anything we used to we did in the past, because it will just make it harder for us to think because it will make it harder for us to really consider what we did and why we did it, because we're not going to want to think about it, but if we rob it of that psychic, we rob it of the ability to hurt us, then we can really learn, we can learn from everything, and that means it was worth doing, that means you there was a it happen, it's it's it's if you can find a reason for it happening out of the mistake and that's easier to do if you don't wrap a lot of guilt and and question and uh negativity around it, we got some really nice uh dappling over here, i got to tell you guys, there's some shaftage going on here, some light shaftage going on by some trees. really nice, really uh, very, very pleasant, it's a good day. uh, yeah, shout out to Neil Postman, I mean, what, how could you describe what's happening more sucsintically than amusing ourselves to death? I mean, if if hypothetically, and this is not going to happen, but if if this coronavirus does push this ricky house of cards over, this gigantic ponzi scheme that is the American economy. It'll be because Americans got so stupefied by entertainment, that they turned politics, I mean, it was not one thing or another, while they were turning politics into entertainment, politics was being robbed of its meaning by backroom deals between Republicans and Democrats to no longer talk about economic issues, but it was easier to do that, because people were looking at the goddamn uh entertainment, and they turned politics into entertainment. and they put an entertainer in charge and he ruled the way that a seniil television addicted, anyone of the people who watches fox news would rule, and isn't that democracy? democracy is representative government. the question is, who does it represent? and among those people, the people who think that you know, well you should really only be able to vote if you're a white land owner anyway, he is the perfect representation of them. and he helped rule, he helped, he helped guide, I mean, obviously the thing is going to come apart one way or the other, we are in terminal crisis, have been since the 70s, Trump has nothing to do with that, but he's the one who crashes the plane into the fucking house of cards, it'd be very funny and very postman, I think a guy like Postman, like he got considered hysteric and over the top and kind of silly when the book came out. and i think that's that's the mark uh that means that you were essentially just too early, you were recognizing what it was going to come out and look like, you could see where the tendruls were going to lead, but that led you to overstate the case to people couldn't see that, they would read you and they wouldn't think of what you were imagining, which is where it's going to end up, they were thinking of what it was in front of them, and they're like, i think you're overreacting, neil, and that's the problem with persuading people, neil postman was like getting a bolt from the blue about where our our uh where our culture of entertainment was going to lead us, but that left him talking to people for whom the evidence he's going to point to doesn't have the same implications for them because they haven't thought it through that well, or they thought it through differently. i'm not crazy, i'm just ahead of the curve, the damn joker, you want to talk about a guy who was above the damn joker. but the other thing is in terms of the the like the mechanisms he's going to be behind the times because he was writing in the fucking 70s or the 80s or whatever the tech like the internet is something that I think even people who were were relatively pressing about it back then could not have conceived of like even Foster Wallis's description of the internet is and he was writing in the 90s when when darpin had already existed and there was a primitive email is kind of hilariously. the uh old fashion somebody's that saying i don't understand the awesome power of the federal reserve, i think i do, but that's what i'm talking about, oh i should say there isn't just a perceived difference in uh, there isn't always just a perceived difference in um in the aims of like the small the small bourgeois republicans who now charge of the political arm of the party and the like the finance directed ones, there is like i said a general, like capitalism is what it is, people who understand the neoliberal turn, people had the neil uh or had the ned Baity speech given to them uh in in the 70s like that scene in network everybody in America got that in some way or another subliminally Jimmy Carter might have gotten it literally an understanding of like your understanding of these notions is limited by your age and by your expectations until now we are entering a new era and the democrats assimilated that the democrats are that party now and now there was a remainder of republicans who are turning that way now what they recognize is that there's only one capitalism, so you can't create it, well maintaining capitalism as exists, you can't create the kind of autarchic structure that these guys want, so they are more correct, that the capitalism's broad long-term interests are served by globalism, by globalization, but for certain small bourgeois, that fucks them over, some of them, but not all of them, some of them end up getting bought out essentially. and assimilated into the finance structure, and then the ones who aren't are in a position to be actually exploited and and uh destroyed by finance capital, but I mean that's the same sort of conflict within the bourgeois that happens in every boujoi dictatorship and it necessitates the state, that's why the state exists to play referee, and to sometimes pick one over the other when they're in actual direct material conflict instead of just like I was talking about earlier. illusory ideological conflict, so in this case there is a direct conflict between small American Bourgeois producers who still exist, and the global uh market, and and that's true in different segments of agriculture and other parts of the economy, but there is no, but the powers that be have decided ideologically, there's no way to maintain capitalism's vitality internationally, without sacrificing those industies, and those people are either going to sell out and stay among the elite or lose out lose it all and become poor, and if they're poor in middle class then they're out of the club anyway and we don't have to talk to them. so yeah, no, there is a genuine, i i i i and i i i i want to correct myself because i was talking about ideology and in talking about it, i forgot to talk about the fact that there is actually a material conflict. between different segments of capital, but that the Fed and the government exist to adjudicate those disputes and the one that's always going to win is going to be the most powerful and influential uh and that's going to be the one closest to the actual spigot of capitalism i finance in wall street and something happened in the chat, people seem to be fussing in the fuding, i wasn't really looking, was talking, what's going on in, what's going on down here in this chat room now? is there going to be a rockish now? now i i heard i ho told that there was a rockish down in the comment section and someone oh they got out the federal reserve guy, well i hope i answered his question or responded to his critique, because the thing is like i always find those fed people there either like i don't get what the point is, there's two points, one point is yeah the're. they're the embodied will of uh of established finance capitalism or what? they're the Jews, at a certain point there's no difference in the way you're describing them, you're not even describing jews, you're describing specific people in positions of super high power, and then you just want to abstract them to have the level of like supernatural beings, because you are not materialist enough your near analysis, you haven't squeezed all of the spiritual do bullshit out of the toothpaste tube. because that's that's what you're trying to do when you're trying to make sense of the world is you're trying to squeeze the ideology, the emotion, the the bias uh that comes from living at the that the level of symbolic abstraction, which we the map, the symbolic map that we use to navigate out the real world, uh, we have to use that, but I don't know a kidnap cat. means that's weird, does that mean like kidnapping or something? i got to say it's it's kind of amazing that since Q is established and since there's been sort of a rise in lone wolf internet adl right-wing shooters, how come no one has gone after like a real an actual place of power, you know, no one shown up at the fed. world bank anything like that, even like the closest thing would be some that dumb ass to like tried to go to CNn in Atlanta, which makes perfect sense, like you think it's the media because you've got a dog's brain. but a lot of these conspiracies understand the role of finance and all this stuff and yet none of them have ever been afflicted by real psychos and even with the pizza gate stuff and the epstein stuff, all anyone wants to really yell out are celebrities, they want to yell at chrissy tegan and not bill gates for some reason, i mean i mean in the degree they want to yellow, no they do want to yellow bill gates, but that's buse he's a famous guy, bill gates is just another celebrity, i mean i'm trying to think of like the uh the finance people like len lex. Wexner, how often do you hear anybody talk about that motherfucker? the guy has not been charged, the guy who fucking funded epstein for the beginning, staked him, gave him power of attorney when his only criteria or his entire career at the point that hire was, he was hired by wexner, and given a geven a fucking mansion, given power of attorney and billions of dollars to manage was, he was a fucking high school math teacher, and then he was a quantum brear sterns and then he was involved in a fucking pyramid scheme that got his partner thrown in jail. and that guy hired him and he's and he's in charge of this massive uh modelling and uh woman's clothing empire, he fucking in the 90s he bought air America, he bought southern air southern air transport, the the fucking CIA front airline that moved heroin through the golden triangle and moved cook. campaign uh from Nicaragua in the 80s, you fucking bought it and had it move its headquarters to to columbus where he lived and was like in charge of the state of Ohio, he's out there, how about you talking about less fucking Wexter not Chris Teagan, even if she's involved in like the child eating, she doesn't even know where those kids come from, they just come down to shoot, you're not even going to get anything from her, just shows how unfiscating all this stuff is. Oh man, Deutsche Bank, holy shit, Deutsche Bank is, so does anybody know what BCE, BCE is? Banko and Braziano, does that that ring a bell? So Banco and Braziano was the Vatican Bank that was used as a piggy bank for the mafia and Gladio during uh during the 60s and 70s, uh, Roberto Kelvy, blackfire bridge, that whole deal, I've talked about it uh, and bcci was the another bank that was... uh discovered during the Iran contra uh hearings to have basically just been a giant pass through uh front for CIA black money like cocaine for cash then for guns for whatever whatever anybody needed uh and I would say that Deutsche Bank is that now when you look at their connections to Epsteen uh cartels uh Russian mafia big time I mean that was fucking that was Donald Trump's job not being on the apprentice is job. before he became president was laundering Russian drub money courtesy of Deutsche Bank so that's another reason that this the the conspiratorial turn it is is inevitable and and inevitable given our love of narrative and and our our atomization but it's so distressing cuz just leaves you to just who wants to talk. about some boring banker when you talk talk about all the celebs on the TV that you hate all the time and that you yell at when they're doing all their gay rights bullshit bcci was connected to Robert Maxwell yes as Maxwell was connected to Aron contra and the promise scandal which if anybody anybody read the 50 biggest conspiracies of all time uh a classic book uh also a graphic novel they talked that's where i learned about uh promise the promise software Danny Calossaro is. instigation of octopus that led to his suicide in a hotel room in Virginia uh now he was he was like a zelig of of 80's spook shit and then he just fell off of his yacht the lady Gislaine man I'm very interested to see what happens with the the Gislane trial my my gut is this is all limited hangout it's the only thing that really makes sense but we'll see I just imagine her like taking a a ply deal to go to a spa prison and exchange for just tiding up all the loose hands and maybe bearing one or two guys who like maybe Trump has a grudge against or something and then saying goodbye i i just don't understand i don't understand when they found her alive i was like well fuck i don't know that's a whole level of uh the the simulation that i haven't cracked yet and the funny thing is is you can't even say well they can't kill her because we all know in our hearts. that they could buse i remember saying they can't kill him on the first episode of true or not i said that they can't kill him and then they did because what are you going to do about it? they kill her what are you going to do about it? what you're going to lose faith in the government? oh wow, we're terrified of that. what are you going to do? uh, complain about it on twitter, go to a fucking q and on protest? we don't give a shit. Do I feel like Ed Tom bell, I just feel overmatched. No, I feel good i feel fine, I'm vibing, I feel like a good and not a a a... not an not a good version cuuse i don't think i'm good, i'm that good, but like a non-evil anton sugar right now, buse i feel like anton kind of was self-actualizing in a perverse way, and i feel like i'm getting closer to that, he's a psychopathic killer, but so what plenty of them around? oh someone says they've been watching logge 49 and loving it, good that show rips, i recommend it to everybody, we gotten just one more season now, All right, I'm going to go soon, folks, and one more question, oh, just thank you for reminding me, smoke pork was very good, it wasn't as good as Wills, but I didn't expect that, first time try him and all uh, it didn't have like the crackling outer. that he gets uh but that's i mean i was working with fucking coals and first time ever so uh but now it was it was juicy the it was there was had some marbling on the flesh uh went very well with the hoys and little potato bun it was good i was happy about it i talked about Portland at the beginning of the episode worst transformers movie great way to end It's hard to say any of call any of them bad, you know, it kind of misses the point of a Michael Bay movie, they're they're not to be judged, they're to be witnessed, and let me think, the second one is universally considered the most incoherent because it's it was interrupted by the writer strike and they essentially started because of how much it cost to keep uh that production moving, they essentially just kept shooting without a script, which you could definitely tell uh, and so that's usually considered the worst one, the third one's pretty good, it's the most like narratively coherent, the the mark walberg ones are both pretty good, the whole thing of Mark walberg frame from Texas is very funny, I really like cogman in the fifth one and of course the thing where Harriot Tubman was a secret friend of the autobots during the annabel period, that was fantastic, I guess that leaves the... fourth one, yeah, the fourth one is also kind of annoying buse it's a um, but the fourth one has Stanley touchi and he does a great job, I guess two, yeah, two is the worst one, although two has its moments as well, there's a thing where they have a giant uh evil transformer that's made out of other transformers that are all earth movers and construction devices and there's these two giant uh uh balls, like iron balls they used to smash, wrecking balls, two wrecking balls hanging from from chains at the crotch, and John Tuturo was trying to call in a an air strike and he goes, i'm underneath the alien scrowed, and then what's even funnier is they use that as a moment to show off a rail gun, which they used to blow up this transformer railgun technology, which is one of those massive fucking pentagon boond doggles. they spend billions of dollars on this hypothetical shit that doesn't work, and then they make propaganda movies where it's like, okay, yeah, this might seem like a big waste of money, but what if there's a... giant transformer trying to destroy uh one of the pyramids of Giza so that he can create uh grab a telemetry tracker and create a giant space laser to destroy earth, then you're going to want a fucking rail gun. they also put the f22 in the first one, what if we? yeah, sure, there's no real dog fights anymore, air superiority is is beyond established uh, but and there's no possibility of dog fights, but what if there's what if starscream is there, and star scream, remember, He's he's a very fast jet, we're gonna have to be even faster than him. Yeah, just literal propaganda. Rail guns also used uh in the film eraser where they have a a handheld rail gun that like shoots people. through walls and shit, man, sports neger really knew how to pick them, man was just a talent, all right guys, now i got you got me thinking about all my faces, you got me thinking about my transformance movie, so thank you, i'm feeling good, bye bye
