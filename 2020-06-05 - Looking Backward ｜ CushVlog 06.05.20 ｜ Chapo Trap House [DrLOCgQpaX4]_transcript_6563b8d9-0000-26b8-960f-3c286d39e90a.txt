 Oh no, it's live, oh ah, there we go, ah, there we go, there we are, hello everyone, roll and roll and roll and rolling what we're rolling, roll and roll and rolling what? one day lymp biscuit will answer for 9/11, i hope, in the cosmic plane if not in this one, eventually there will be some rechoning for the irresponsible role they had in calling down the cosmic forces that led to 911 and then the war in irak. and the war ontero, hey guys, it's a very rainy today, it's uh the tropical depression or whatever, today is the day, it finally happened, it's been very annoying becuse i never know how to plan my stuff and what to do and because i'm always waiting for the rain to come and it has not come and now it's finally happening, it's raining, but this weekend is going to be nice they say which is bad news for the nypd, we'll be out there, don't know where yet, but we will see, but i want to keep doing the uh streams and when it gets nice again as i've promised grill stream incoming but right now it's literally raining at the moment and i was thinking since this feels for me anyway like a moment that's sort of suspended in many time in this moment of tumoltuous shifts not inside it's raining time to do what i like to do best which is look backwards so i was figuring instead of commenting on what's happening right now and anyway specifically like we're starting off with some sort of dissertation on of the events of the day or the week uh, I was thinking that maybe we could talk history, historical parallels, moments, moments that rhyme as George Lucas would say, moments that people want to talk about, so uh, I'll I get to start sort of by asking anybody on the stream anybody in the comments section who wants to drop a question, what questions do they have, and I'll see if I can answer them, or at least talk through them and around them about historical moments that that they'... uh find resonant in the current moment. so let's see what we got. i won't be able to talk about all these of course because i don't know that much about that much. 1848 is the first one someone says and 1848 is a good one to start with uh because 1848 was a very similar situation uh in that it was the unplanned spontaneous exp. explosion of a long simmering uh resentment and dissatisfaction around uh a very sudden and dramatic shift in material conditions in two ways: one you had the rise of uh industrial uh capitalism which was driving people to uh soody miserable conditions in cities and also even more importantly because at this point they're still weren't that many industrial capital workers, there weren't that many laborers yet as a percentage of the population. in in cities, they created competition and conflict with the dwindling and uh and undersiege artisan class, and then so you had this shift in mode of production and the way people uh uh work, very similar to the way, it was sort of the first rung on the ladder of of coursive rearrangement of working conditions, because before the mid-1800s there was so much land in common that there was always a ability to - all else failed subside subsist on the land which gave you bargaining power in any specific job that was greater uh than the ability of the of the boss to get you to work for them, if they were paying you enough you could say fuck off and grow turnips. of course enclosure acts all that we all know that was gone by the by the mid-1800s so people were being forced into labor arrangements and wage relationships and and that the artisan class, the the individual self-employed manufacturer uh, which was sort of a legacy of feudalism is was still a prevalent uh uh employment in cities, but it was very uh precarious as the thing, there were a lot of very poor artisans, like there were the poor artisans drove the French revolution, there were still plenty of poor artisans in cities throughout Europe in 1848 uh, but then even the rich artisans were were uh in conflict with the state over the uh shift towards free markets away from industrial uh from local protectionism and the dropping of tariffs that made homeecrafts less uh less competitive on the market, and so there was this pressure on people to behave to uh, to to work in different ways, to be more coersed into labor, to have less control over their own working lives, parenthetically people always like to talk about, well what, because so much of our understanding of politics because of neoliberalism and and and capitalist ideology shaping our responses, even our alienation from it, we tend to go to standpoint a lot when we talk about ideas and so obviously people want to talk about podcasters on the left, what are you? you're not working class, especially if you're making a a decent amount of money from it uh and it's like not podcasters specifically anyway uh podcasters like us who work uh uh who get money from directly from their listeners we're artisans we are we are those the like the guy making uh uh making like stockings in his house like that's us it's it's it's a pre- capitalist of production or - and that's still embedded, so even now that's still embedded within capitalism because nothing is totalizing, but anyway there was this push away from that self, that degree of alien of of control over one's work, like even if you weren't making money, even if you were poor, you still had control of your own working conditions, which is means you were less alienated to somebody had to work in a factory with the direction of somebody else, but you were being pushed in that direction, people are being pushed in that direction. so you just the way now, after that has been totalized after wage labor became totalized under capitalism, eventually though, the deal broke down where the initial deal of, okay, you'll work for me and that'll be it, and you i will be your employer, and we will have a direct relationship, employer, employee, and then after the rise of working as okay, and maybe you'll have a labor union or something, or you'll be a manager and you'll have more control over your life, well after the 70's crisis, after the... terminal decline of capitalism after became harder and harder to bring profits out of old business models, all of a sudden they wanted you to not work directly for anyone, they wanted people to all be contractors being hired for specific jobs that require that involves and uh suggests no extended relationship, no duty between the two or only one one duty in one way, uh, you you owe your uh employer, your surplus labor and that's it, your labor power, that's it, that's all you owe them. and they don't owe you anything, at least and in and in the the American sort of uh labor capitalist um treaty, the the dayton that happened after World War II and that persisted and was never let down by labor by the way, it was only let down by capital slowly in behind their backs, uh, there was a relationship, there is an implied responsibility of an employer uh, but that cost money, and now they're trying to squeeze that out of the economy, every job basically made. since then economic collapse in 2008 has been some sort of short-time, part-time or gig job, that's almost all of them, not even exaggerating that, you can look it up, that you are literally reproducing one type of employment with another that is even more alienated and more thread bear and more precarious than the one before it, which is the same pressure that was operating in 1848, but at the same time you have that, instead of it just be that like if that is a company economic growth that sort of smooths smooths it away because it pays you back it's like yeah yeah you're more alienated now but you also make more money and there's more stuff to buy and there's a general rise and uh uh uh you know living standards and happiness and you're kind of being booyied up and it's okay that you're being alienated more from control of your workplace or control of your labor hours but in 1848 there had been a prolonged sustained uh continent-wide uh uh agricultural crisis uh the potato famen that people remember from Ireland did not just affect Ireland, it affected the entire it affected the entire continent of Europe uh and it essentially decimated peasant ability to to to live all throughout the continent, but in addition to that, there were all it was also severely cold harsh summers because this was the tail end of the little ice age uh and they'... there was huge failures of crops all throughout the staple crop uh uh fields of Europe, which of course cause in the cities massive rises in costs of everything specifically food stuffs and that meant that poor people couldn't eat and wealthier people were spending more of their money on food, everybody was pissed off, so you're gaining, you're losing control of your workplace and you're not even getting any money for it, you're getting paid money that is worth less buse you have to spend more of it on the food that you could you have to eat no matter what, that's an inelasticuh good. and now what do we see now? we see this exact same slow-motion and surf reinsurfment going along with the collapse of the economy literally. all those gig jobs not even existing anymore and so what happens a spark lighs off a explosion of resentment that is seen by others and it spreads through the continent. now of course you wouldn't have to guess where the where revolutions of 1848 started, they had to start in the place that was continental Europe's first revolutionary uh cruisible. i mean, this is this is why history is so great, you know, like you if you read about the french revolution. and then you say okay so that happened and then there was the continent wide reaction and then Louis got the burbans got reinstalled and then you could ask that person all right then 1848 later on if they didn't know anything about European history go in 1848 things pop off again where do you think it started where did it start last time france the most populous uh uh country a country that was not developing economically with the insane uh speed of the UK uh and that did not have uh the UK uh imperial resources to fall back on either i might add uh feeling all the worst effects of change and very little of the benefits and and a tradition of of successful revolutionary action you're going to go on the streets more likely to go on the streets if it you know it's worked, i mean that's i think why so many people are paralyzed now and so many people want to go to the computer to find a reason not to go out and not to support not even to even not even support the demonstrations because you don't want to be disappointed, and you look at that, you go like, oh, like, look at the record of of of these things, they don't work, so this isn't going to work either, but of course, that depends on how many people are involved and how people respond to ch to the conditions and the reactions of the state and things like that. so in France, one of the reasons revolutions kept working, one of the reasons they were so effective, one of the reasons the way they were able to re-overthrow the burbons after they were installed, and then overthrow the orleionists was because they knew going out worked and so they went out more and they were more likely to do it and more likely to stay out and so everybody in Europe saw the flames rise in Paris and what do you know everywhere people were pissed they threw up the goddamn barricades but because it was a spontaneous revolt that had no coordination that was essentially carried out by by the same uh, the same class of people everywhere, but everywhere, but distinctly separated, meant that there was no unified purpose behind it. um, so in France, the main art demands were for the overthrow of uh, of the Orleanists and the inst the installation of a republic and and the right to work for industrial workers, which included artisans who were not being engaged for labor and oppressed. uh economy uh, in the German cities, it was those things, but more importantly than any of them, the thing that they thought was necessary to get any of them a unified german state. now we might look back on that and say, you know what, you guys really uh, you guys really need to look back on your math, someone fucked up big time, because you know god love them everybody thought that was a good idea at the time, even marks, but looking back, oh unifying germans turns out not to be a great idea. there's a little too much blood and thunder in that line, I don't, I think it's something about the language, the language has a sort of uh, I don't know, there's a there's a mystic bloody mindedness to German, it's all those compound words, uh, they should be separated, is all I'm saying, the like the bishop ricks and stuff and the Prince Dutches, those that was a good elect palantine, the you know uh, bar graves and land graves and shit, that was a better. scenario uh unifying that, but anyway they thought that they thought the only way we're going to get anything is if we get rid of this patchwork of stupid fucking thiefdoms with you know individual uh royal families and and duchies and and uh archbishops all of whom were reactionary all of whom commanded greater or less degrees of absolutest control over their populations unite under one enlightened constitutional monarch and the thing is is they weren't wrong in seeing that as a worthwhile goal, the same way that the United States now in a similar situation is wildly hindered uh by uh, wildly hinder by federalism, wildly because I mean I we don't have the same worry about being unified because we're already there and we're already doing you know we're already doing a terrible job, but like there it's clear at this point that the states aren't helping anything, so and by the way, I'm not being a uh, linguistic determinism is or idealism, languages are the way they are because of the the surroundings, the actual environment that the people who develop the language. existed in, so they are an imprint from a specific physical moment in space and time, so that's what they're carrying with it, the language is just a marker and a reinforcer of it, and over time it gains power, especially as the original conditions are less and less there to reinforce, they reinforce on their own, but they and they they have an effect, okay, nothing is as simple, based superstructure, these ideas are not as simple as they appear. because they are also at a certain point they become reinforcing uh uh feedback loops that require one another and that if one wasn't there it wouldn't have operate the same way but anyway in Italy they wanted Italian unification uh in the in the in the in the Austrian uh empire uh the the the sort of the rump remnant of the Holy Roman empire uh that wasn't totally uh severed by Napoleon they... the individual nationalities wanted their own goddamn uh, they wanted their own places, the Hungarians wanted their own country, the the the Bohemians wanted their own country, um, and so all of these revolts happened without really any coordination, uh, they forced the hands of their governments, they were, there was initial capitulation, and then eventually uh reactionary forces just waited uh for one thing. for the urban middle class to sell out the workers, which they did very quickly because they weren't as interested in a social revolution, they wanted uh just political reforms to reflect the enlightenment values that had become pervading in the middle classes, and then once the working class has sort of been demobilized by disillusionment, and all that was left were essentially the students and some of the wealthy. artisans, they rolled them up, and so there is plenty of reason to see parallels between 19, 1848 and now, the same spontaneity, the same lack of a coherent organizing principle, but I think there are also significant differences, and one of them is that nationalism, at least the way that it affected those uh, conflicts is no longer relevant in this era, I think the closest thing you say uh would hold the place for nationalism as in a thing that is within the move a movement that is uh that is potentially a conflict point is uh race uh and but the good the good news is is that all of these different revolts that happen in Europe their geographic location discretely uh is what uh reproduce their separation. uh, you know, you had the Czechs in Prague, you had the Hungarians in Budapest, you know, you had the the Romans in uh, the Italians in in Rome and Florence and stuff, and so that they were separated literally by geography, and so coordination was rendered impossible, and because those goals were also either, sometimes were in conflict with one another, or were um totally irrelevant to one another, like for example, the Hungarians wanted a... independent Hungarian state, but there is also an overwhelming demand for Hungarian to be the uh the presiding language of Hungary, but the problem is Hungary was also multinational and there are a bunch of Croats and uh and Serbs um in the territory of Hungary uh Moldovans who didn't want to fucking speak Hungarian and so that created a civil war within the within the war itself, but in this case that. that racial divide is reproduced inside every city and inside every movement, which means that if it's going to be resolved, it can be resolved at the actual point of contact, which is a very good sign, uh, yes, the croats are actually the ones whe rolled up the Hungarian Revolution, uh, Ban jelicic, shout out to him. I saw a uh statue of him in when I was in Croatia, a five star pimp if ever there was one, because because it that is why class is so important and that's why economic issues are important if anyone wants to win, because think about the Croats right, the Croats were also subjects of the Aust Austrian empire, they want there was an there was Croatian nationalism, there was a sense of Croatian identity uh, but also they were part uh, they were under the subsequent heel of the Hungarians, so when the Hungarians say we want to be independent of Austria, we want an independent Hungarian speaking country, what is their appeal to the croats to get them to. instead of taking the orders of the of the emperor and crushing them, uniting with them, what do they give a shit? in fact that's directly in conflict with their desires, there has to be something that can commonly unify everyone who is in a position of uh of oppression to uh push together, and that requires empathy, but it also requires self-interest, because they should not and don't have to be at odds, they can and must in fact be together, self-interest and and alturism. need to be uh unified, one of the big problems with the fact that so much of the left is wealthy and and operates from a sense of morality is that for wealthier people uh the the reverse is true, in fact they don't feel that they are operating politically unless they are operating selflessly, their morals require self-abneation to operate because they have money because they're not oppressed, and so to the degree that they run things is to which they're not going to be necessarily interested in alleviating anything, not only one at the material level because they benefit from the arrangement, but two from the psychic level, that they develop, they they derive their sense of good conscience from the fact that they are, that they give their money for people who don't have it, and that they vote for people who will take money from them for people who don't have it, or whatever, or that they care about issues that affect other people, that's what makes them good. And that is, I mean, you can have people like that following the train as the as the lower bourjois always will, but they can't be in charge, so that is why if we have any hope right now, it is that this movement coaleses around issues of radical redistribution, and I really do feel like I don't agree with anyone says. that oh, this has icy id pall over it, therefore it can't work, that's idealism, that's that's what happens when you spend all your time online, everything exists these frictionless categories that never interact, and they're totally polarized because you're engaging exclusively in uh in anti-dialectical polarizing uh uh dialogue with one another that you say, oh it's it's got the icky stuff on it, it's therefore icky, it can't be good, that is, that is the delusional idealism. of online argumentation, if these things will be resolved, they will be resolved on the ground, and and as much as anything else to challenges the pervading order, I mean, are you going to tell me that fucking policing is not a significant part of the global capitalist order, and yes of course, the danger exists, the danger of course exists, that this all ends with the police being defunded and it just means that bazos builds robocop or something, or that there's a black water in the streets, obviously that's a fucking possibility, but that was going to have... anyway, we are on the slide for that, this might accelerate it, but it's also the only thing that can interrupt the the the prospect that can interrupt the the the the inexorable movement towards that inevitability, you're not saying anything by saying, oh a bad thing could happen because of this, no shit, bad things are basically all that happen, the question is do you look at the thing in front of you, the thing that actually emerge from these actual conditions as opposed to something you imagine might uh emerge in conditions that aren't real, they're in your head, then I don't know what the fuck to tell you, because that's the only thing that's going to stop the slide, that's the only thing that's going to interdict this avalanche, and if if it does end with defunded police, but funded fucking uh black water uh the security agents, well then then we fucked up somewhere and then we could... correct the fuck up in the future, that's always what it is, the idea that there is some victory you can have that is untainted and complete, that's insane, that that's literally uh, that's millenniariism, that's that's that's escatological utopian madness, and it's only possible because you're thinking of these things as discrete battles, you're thinking of everything is a discrete event that is unconnected to reality, because that's how you can think about something, you have to disentangle it from its context right, or else you can't look at it, otherwise it's embedded, but in real life everything is embedded, and so you can't know until you find out, and so you have to find out, sorry, but you have to, there's no way you can reason yourself into saying that I'm going to stay behind the computer, because if you are, you're looking for a reason to stay behind the computer, and that means that you don't actually care about politics, you care about being on the computer and talking about politics is one of the things that makes it fun to be on. computer, so ask yourself that, look yourself in the mirror and say, do I really? care about any of this political stuff or do i really like basically because i don't know what else to do with my time, i don't have a thing that i can invest in that will that i have any promise will give me back any psychic pleasure, this is the thing i know makes me feel good and i know that like politics is like one of the like i i just eating from a big internet stew every day and it's different seasonings and so like the salt and pepper are politics and video games and the fucking uh the the garlic is uh is pornography uh well this the the actually the broth is pornography who are we kidding and essentially i like i like this i like this delicious pazole or whatever it is and and and one of the things that gives a taste is the emotional zinng i get from arguing about politics and if that wasn't there the soup wouldn't taste as good i wouldn't want to eat as much of it. and since I don't have anything else to eat, then I want my soup to taste as good as possible, and that might be, that's a lot of people, and the thing is, that's okay, I don't blame anyone for that, I am not trying to make having political opinions of some total of someone's morality, that is what the internet tells you to do, I don't judge anyone for that, I don't judge anyone for trying to cope with this world however they can, but don't fucking think that you're doing politics at the end of the day, you're season. your goddamn soup, and if you're okay with that, that's okay, but don't lie to yourself, because it'll only make it harder for you, you'll only be more miserable, but maybe you're not, maybe you like being miserable, maybe you're a sicco, and of course this applies to everybody, everyone's eating the soup when they're on the internet, it's just a question of how much time are you spending eating the soup, I of course love eating the soup, that's the reason I love politics because it's a delicious zing, because it gives me a sense of purpose. and and I and I uh virtue and identity and uh and and discernment, but I also know that it is not a meal, it's a fantasy meal to to get way too involved with the metaphor, so the question is, how how real is it to you? and it will be to a degree, commitment is to by degree, but there are also those inflection points, and if you have decided I'm going to. ignore, condemn or mock from a position of superiority and superior knowledge, this uh uprising or whatever it is, then you have made that choice, you have internet is the the that's your entire uh food stuff, is that fucking is the chunky soup of the internet, and that you really love those, you love that politics, you love them, you get that in there, oh you get them politics in there in that gumball, oh me, oh my, you get that, i tell you right now, you like my gumbo? That's fine, but if I put that politics in that gumball, oh my god me, you're going to slap your mama cuz she voted for Trump, all right, so that was 1848, anybody got another one, uh, it was 1917, I believe they meant, a function. of revolutionary success or the weakness of the regime, i think it's pretty clear that Russian revolution succeeded because the fact that Russia was not a modern state, like the creation of a modern economy doesn't only create alienation the way marks saw it, it also creates accomodation and cooptation within a system over time, and I think that's something you underestimated just because he was not. to see it carry out, it's one of those things where you can't even say he was wrong, you can just say he lived at a place and time and then he wasn't alive anymore, that's not a criticism, it's just an observation uh, but Russia, even though it had the aputterrances and a lot of the uh capacity of a modern state in its real uh self was not, it was a medieval, it was a medieval society that had that had the 20th century drop in its lap in the form of the eastern front. and that meant that it was much easier to overcome resistance because resistance was essentially just coming from a a inbred fucking royal family and a small uh layer of civil servants and everybody else was either a small number of workers and then a bunch of disinterested to alienated peasantry, that's not that's not that doesn't describe any contemporary culture, any contemporary society. somebody asked about the Iranian revolution uh That that Ian revolution is always a really good warning call for the left because it is often forgotten, but that was originally a popular uh uprising that involved a lot of leadership from the urban left wing, the communist party and like radical students, and that over time they slowly were removed from power, isolated and then eventually massacred by the uh Islamists uh headed by uh Humani, and so keep your head on. a swivel uh, the easter rising, the easter rising is a lot like John brown's raid in that it's a good reminder for people who fixate on the efficacy of action. now you don't want to do things that might back fire worse, but i think a lot of people talk themselves into thinking that they support things, they oppose things. because they think the backlash will be worse than doing nothing, but a lot of it boils down to they don't want to risk their lives for something that's not going to succeed or doesn't have a chance to succeed, and i think both John brown's raid and the easter rising were conceived by men uh who did not expect them to work, they did not in both, i mean uh patrick pierce said as much, he said that what is required was a blood sacrifice, i mean of course he said that, he was a catholic mystic psycho, whistled on his way to the x uh to the firing squad. but they accept, but they were also recognitions that only some sort of dramatic interaction with the status quo was going to shake the uh the the stalemate open and break out of an unsustainably of a morally unsustainable situation and they were both right, they all died, but they were both they were all right, because within 10 years of both of those acts there was a free ireland, although obviously it was still part of the commonwealth, but it was on its way to being free, the queen wasn't on the money anymore, and slavery was abolished, and so those actions, which it would have required delusion, true delusion to think would have succeeded, John brown going into the woods to successfully roll up an entire revolutionary battalion that would i guess the northerners would just decide to like jump in halfway through and help him out or that that the uh that the the seasure of the post office and fucking st Stephens green was going to kick the brits out of Ireland after 500 years, but what they were going to do is they were gonna they were going to change things and honestly the guy who I respect the most obviously for doing that was Connoly because Patrick Pierce was he was born wanting to die, he was a catholic psycho, he was a blood, he was like the worst kind of like uh of uh of like Mel Gibson style uh mortification fetishist. uh the kind the candy catholic for whom life is a disgust is a vile and should be scorned and fled from uh so of course he whistled to the fucking firy swat Conneley was a fucking communist connely didn't think he was going to heaven connely didn't think he'd be sitting at the right hand of of god srumming on a fucking harp but he knew that his people could that he knew he couldn't stand to just live an entire life watching uh as fucking England just squeeze the life out of his entire country he would not have been happy to see what happened after after uh the civil war though I'll tell you that. man, place just turn into a fucking a giant magdalen laundry. ooh, this is a bummer. uh, did entering the nuclear age of mass destruction in 1945 create a permanent technological steady state that human determination may never be able to overcome. uh, I wouldn't say, if that's true, it wouldn't just be the nuclear bomb, I would say it would be the nuclear bomb, the uh combusting engine and the internet together, might have done that, but here's the thing, it might have done that, but we can't know it has. has any more than we know we live in a simulation right, because it won't it could only be validated in retrospectively, we can't know, so just like with the the uh question of if we're in a simulation, you have to act as though you aren't because it's the only option, so you have to act as though we can overcome the technology, we have to act that way, even if we can, just like we have to act like we are in the matrix even if we are, because there is no alternative, and that isn't even being snarky, it's a function of... being a human. Yeah, exactly, nobody's the quadarak. The internet makes people think that they are, because it gives that illusion of total uh, total information, because if you if you really interrogated people, they would admit, sure, I know that I don't really know anything, I just know what the internet tells me, but you nobody acts that way, people do not act like that, people act like they have been able to glean enough of the real uh, the real terrain of reality to to grab. like the nettle of of truth and see backwards and forwards through the prism of history, you can't, you can't do it, none of you can, and if people say they can, they are literal frauds, they are fucking charlotans, but that doesn't mean you can't act, you have to act, but that has to be that only comes from reacting with the world, it cannot be wishcast through the internet, it cannot be reasoned with, so many people online basically play both sides of a chess match and then say okay this is what's going to happen no you have to play the opponent on the actual match you can't assume what their moves are going to be and that's how people act on when they talk like if somebody says oh it's just going to end with uh robocops everywhere they have played the chess match ahead and have decided how everyone's going to move they might trust that that's true but you're a sucker if you do i'll tell you that. uh somebody saying marx did what i'm talking about yeah marx is one of the most one of the singular geniuses in human history he's a top time all-time brain you're not i'm not you can't assume you are, he could do that because it buse he had the commitment to it and because he got enough reinforcement from the world around him to make him think he was on the right track that he was able to, doing all that shit on the internet, you're not struggling the way he did to do it, you don't have fucking you don't have to stay up in your little uh in your little garret with a with a fucking lamp on uh covered in pustuals, you haven't eaten in a week, you got to write another letter to fucking angles from the send. 20 pounds uh, you're hunched over, no, you're in your gaming chair with air conditioning on, and you're fucking cruising the web and you're not even doing the work, are you in the fucking uh, are you in, are you in the British library pouring over the blue books of parliamentary inquiry? no, you're fucking breeze, you're looking at posts, you've read 10,00 posts, that doesn't make you marks and it's not just because he was smarter than you, it's because he was willing to suffer, he was willing to do things that... fun to get there, you're only doing fun things, you're eating candy for dinner, we're all eating candy for dinner on here, if you if you could do this, if if the meger outcome of your posts and your ideas about politics could sustain you in a fucking uh, in an attic without air conditioning writing for 10 hours at a time under lamplight or whatever, then okay, i would like to see what you have written. but if you're doing it in the comfort of a of an of life that is otherwise so alienated that it's the only way you can even find meaning then i bet they're dog shit sorry because marks did not do what we did because he did not have a computer he did not have a air conditioning he don't have a checking account or he didn't have a credit card these things mean things are different like the conditions of life change the thoughts, change the the the the the the vocabulary, so direct comparison across time is impossible, and of course the the to quoke is you're on the internet right now, and it's like, you got me, I'm scared, I'm just one guy, I have to measure my commitments against my desire to maintain. my comfort and I'm probably and I definitely wanting, I'm wanting where I would want to be ideally as we all are, but I have to actually look at it, I can't, I can't go in here, I can't dive in here to try to uh, escape from that feeling, because to quote the bible, the wicked flee with none pursue it, you're going to chase yourself across the internet to try to escape from that feeling. and eventually you're going to have to act in order to to deal with it or you're going to have to further uh delusion delude yourself. All right, so uh, anybody else got another historical question here, am I mad? I try not to be mad anymore, actually, you know, when I get mad like this, I'm really not talking to anybody on the internet, I'm really yelling at past me, I'm yelling at the me who wasted a lot of time trying to do all the things I'm describing and just got felt worse and worse over time, so that's why I'm like, oh god, you fucking idiot, you were such a fucking idiot, that's really what it comes down to, so I'm not really mad at anybody but me, uh, but the thing is I have to forgive myself uh... and everyone has to forgive themselves too, because if you're too filled with self-loathing, you can't, you can't do anything. i'm not a finished civil war buff, i didn't know such a thing existed. i wonder if they have reenactments, that'd be funny. i don't think of my sutori moment is wearing off, i think it's being reinforced at every point. uh Mexican rev pearlsten, I've said pearlsteen doesn't like me, he just doesn't like the show because we're rude to his friends, I mean that's and he's like he is constitutionally a liberal uh, he has a lot of faith in America's uh political institutions, which is honest, because he is a political historian, like he doesn't really do uh, he doesn't... do material analysis uh like when he talks he talks about Nixon uh and it's almost entirely in the context of watergate and stuff and very little about Bretton Wood's system breaking down and and you know in his book about Reagan not a lot about not a lot about Volker and stuff it's all kind of just seasoning uh so he has a lot more faith in like political processes determining outcomes so that you know and that means that he's really good at writing about him because he does the work and he's he's got the nuance to understand. and uh and he's done the research so they're all they're very fun to read and they'll tell they'll teach you a lot about how politic politics functions but not really integrated into like a broader material uh analysis and that's fine that's how most people are, most people are only going to get a partial partial description of any historical process I mean my god of course uh so they're very useful to that end but I think that because of that he doesn't like our rudeness and he also he's a guy who gets published in a lot of the magazines whose writers uh we have made fun of and who get mad at us and have blocked us on twitter and probably have complained to him at uh at uh at parties about us and he probably was like ah why why are these people so truculent so that's too bad vian sapata man that was something mexican revolution uh there's actually a book by that name being spotted by uh frank by frank and Neil, I think his name, it's pretty good, I write it when I was a kid, uh, I mean the revolutionary dynamics of the 60s failed due to their class character more than anything, I mean it was a middle class uprising of middle class students, people literally didn't even have jobs yet, people weren't even integrate, they they hadn't even been got bought off with like professional jobs or whatever at that point, they they were just exogenous to the economy, so that's bad. Yeah, uh, I mean, the problem now is that there's a similar uh, exogeny here, just because there's less necessary work being done, as we now see, um, I mean if you can, if you can have 20, 30% of the population stop working overnight and things keep moving, then that does undermine the ability to to strike capitalism at uh vulnerable points to cause it to uh potentially stop. uh abolition of police unions okay now that's interesting um buse yeah i think police abolition i do think is is kind of childish i understand why people feel the need to to have it as a as a totem but realistically it's obviously not the the beginning of any real uh demands, police unions are are different, but at the same time it's difficult to say everyone in America should get you know collective bargain except one group of people uh, like I said on on the show before i i think maybe radically limiting what unions can negotiate on uh would be good, like i said not allowing them to uh to resist something like a residential requirement or civilian oversight uh or taking their fucking guns away, i i still don't know what community based policing is man, i still all this stuff when he it ends up like boiling down to either it's cat music. like banging pots and pans in front of somebody's front room for litering or or I don't know what, I think we have not yet reestablished enough of a of a communal relationship with each other to allow that kind of thing to do anything other than eventually be alienated and abbregated to specific groups of people and then you're back to having the cops, you have to recreate a social fabric for anything like that to work, it it emerges from a new social fabric, it isn't it isn't a it doesn't. create one out of whole cloth uh, I would say it doesn't compromise you negotiation more broadly because a lot of those things aren't things that other unions care about like the uh postal workers union don't care about getting able to carry guns or whether or not there's civilian that there's some sort of oversight for them for the for for if they did something fireable, it's just what they would do for fireability is different, they don't have a right to kill people. "if programs like cointelpro and MK Ultra never ended, what are they doing now? That's something I've thought a lot about and it's scary to consider. Uh, I don't know. i mean that's the big what if like what if this all buse we talked about this on q and on me and well there was that article in the Atlantic by that woman when she was a teenager believed in illuminati stuff and now doesn't and she has this paragraph where she acknowledges yeah there were things like mk ultra and and uh whatever but but the thing is she never talks about what happened at the end of any of those they get found out years later nobody ever gets put in jail no the agencies to carry them out stop being funded, nobody gets more accountable, so why would anything change? we get this mannacy of like, uh, the fact that it was discovered 10 years after it happened through a limited hangout means that that it was stopped, i don't, i only thinking about that one because that's another one where if it if they really did perfect uh perfect the gumbo uh then we're all dancing to their puppet tune and we ceased to be uh to even have... a delusion of independence - or or of a even our free will was compromised beyond beyond recconing beyond saving, but same thing with everything else, you have to assume you can only operate from the assumption that it's not true, at every point, it's like, yeah, this sucks, it sucks not knowing, but it's the not knowing that makes you act, it's it's the not knowing that that pushes you through the doorway cuz you have to make a leep off. That's that's where human consciousness emerges from, do I actually believe in free will? Free will is absolute in a subjective sense, you are free completely, but your actions are completely. fully determined, it's just that that doesn't matter, because you don't know how, you can't see everything that is leading you to your decision, you can only sense even vaguely a few of the almost infinite specific, specific events and encounters and and uh influences that led you to make a decision, you can only you're only vaguely aware of a handful, so that means that that ignorance is the degree, you operate from free will because you don't know why you're doing what you're doing, you don't know why you're doing what you're doing, so you have to so you you can't use that as the way to do the next thing, because you are ignorant of too much of it, that doesn't matter, but that also doesn't change the fact that outside of you subjectively, as if your entire actions charted with a full understanding of of the influences that went into them, no they were 100% completely determined, no free will at all. but none of that means anything and has no influence on the subjective reality of free will. It's both, the the girl in the taco belt, that the girl and... old el passo commercial, the why not both girl, is one of the great sages of human history, because basically all of the binary questions that have beddeviled philosophy throughout history, the answer to all of them is both, the only question is how they fit together. I mean the fact that you the fact that your body starts doing things before you even feel the fact that your body starts uh having starts doing things before you're even aware you're making a decision which is true means yeah of course free will isn't true but you don't notice that you're not there for that seven seven second delay you're floating on the top of that decision-making pile you're you're you're his with the steam out of the vents, and you have to make sense of it, you have to make sense of what you're doing, you have to retroactively uh makes uh some sort of justification for it, and that's where morality comes in, that's where all of our our moral, physical, psychic and emotional senses come in. um, uh, somebody says sterner, I forget who it is, but somebody once said to me that they think. that it's very funny that sterner was so hated by Marx and famously Marx wrote more words condemning sterner than Sterner ever published himself uh but but Sterner's description of humanity is is man at the end of the process that Mark sketches out man at that point is sterners man it's just that in under capitalism we cannot be that and we have to get out of it and that means we can't act like that either because it's not in accordance with the world around us. Why do we hate North Carolina so much? I don't hate North Carolina. It's a weird question. any anything we've ever said against the south has been a joke because people from the south keep bugging us to tour there, although less. lately, although honestly at this point i would love to tour anywhere, i would love to tour uh, i would go to the Antarctic mcmury research station and do a show, just to get out of here. I would definitely like to tour Canada first because it's nice and cool, track jackets over there, I'm not wearing it every day now, I i got a little too self-conscious about it, so if I don't now if I the only way I can wear it earnestly is if sometimes I'm not wearing it, it's warm now and that's the other thing. and i was wearing it when it was cooler. uh, i will say that um, somebody mentions all the confederate statues that have been pulled down. uh, i do think that i was always a little disappointed by those protests that were. fixated on removing the statues because that is literally a symbolic issue uh and more importantly none of them very few of them actually succeeded at removing any of the statues, but now with a broader uh uh more challengeing critique that actually hits it significant structures like police interactions uh with urban areas, those fucking things are going down getting pulled up like mushrooms, like what, what, how about this, how about we get away, and it's like shit, we didn't even say anything. of course allowing that to be satisfactory is wrong, but it's amazing the kind of symbolic uh bonuses and side effects you will get as not go on effects of a... a broader and more uh challenging and uh sustained critique of of a social order. depth jubilee obviously uh i said michael brook said it on his show i was on on Tuesday and i agree completely wholehearted we need a jubilee all across the board debt obviously all kinds uh and then even the psychic debt of the internet. all the all the dead weight of our old opinions, you know, just so that we can shrug them off, and of course, oh, they're going to be liars and mountbanks who fraggently uh uh get acknowledged, get, no, no, that guy's bad though, these people are bad, they don't deserve redemption, okay though, you they get the jubilee, you give them the jubilee, if they're still bad and they still act bad faith, then you can condemn someone from a position of understanding, not. not through, not by everyone just fighting the ghosts of each other. someone said my beard is lame and they want to jubilee i mean lame is weird uh it's mostly from laziness but sure fine just don't say it again how about that see there you go absolved everybody has said anything bad in the past i absolved them, but that makes a responsibility going forward to to uh honor people's faith in you for giving you the benefit of the doubt, and then if you don't, at that point you will be right, you can be righteously rejected. all right, this will be my last question, uh, someone says, do you feel like people are focusing too much on the term? rather than actually what's being said on these streams, I mean to the degree that anyone is focusing on it as a uh as as one a call to not caring about anything that's happening around them or as a meme then yeah, I mean that's inevitable though, I mean I can't sweat it too much, I can only say what I can say and hope that some of it filters through the bullshit, the the giant baffles of bullshit uh that separate. everybody from everybody else online, all right guys, i'm gonna go uh, but there will be a grill stream soon, first nice day, we gonna do it, i'm very excited, bye-bye.
