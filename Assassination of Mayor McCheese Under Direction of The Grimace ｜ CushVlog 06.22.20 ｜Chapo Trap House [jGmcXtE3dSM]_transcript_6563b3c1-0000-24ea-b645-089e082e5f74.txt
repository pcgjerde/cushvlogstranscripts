 Hi guys, okay, the vast of night, I couldn't find out if I was on Twitch because I was checking, buse it had to show me a commercial cuz I'm not a Twitch member so I still see the commercial. so apparently there's some movie called the vast of night, well said it wasn't very good, but I'll probably see it at some point, anything with uh, anything that's coming out new to streaming that has anything close to uh hollywood production values, I am just absolutely catnipped for at this point, just anything, that's why I know that Christopher Nolan is dying to get tenent tenat in theaters and have everybody see it on you know. fucking imax with 40 glasses or whatever the fuck but if they just put that shit on uh amaz on like your computer for 20 bucks it would make a billion dollars in one day uh yeah that's the thing i love going to the movies but i can't see it happening anytime soon but i might see 10 and i don't know if they're bring that out in theaters, maybe i will go, fuck it, wear the mask, whatever, do this social distancing in theaters, although honestly i don't know how viable, any of these concepts are, you're literally like by limiting entry into places like restaurants and movie theaters, you're limiting revenue in an environment in which they're still having to pay uh price uh rent and play overhead that were fact did not factor in that level of revenue limitation. Ah, all right, so let's talk about the fireworks thing for a minute, uh, so yeah, I've obviously heard a lot of fireworks, this last couple weeks, I saw somebody lighting off pretty impressive ones just in front of me uh on the street a few nights ago, it hasn't been too intense late at night in my neighborhood so I don't know uh what other this experience are but and I haven't seen cops set them off or anything I saw some neighborhood people setting them off one time but who knows where they got them uh i i mean obviously there's like a whole range of conspiracy theories right, there's a whole bunch of different, you got you can go from just you know uh cops are looking the other way while people are selling them more out than they used to and they're not responding to calls so people can light them off longer to the cops are literally supplying them and carrying it out as some sort of uh some sort of fourth of July gladio type operation, i think as usually is the case. bear in mind I have no idea, I don't have any more information than any of you people have, so probably in the middle somewhere, I mean the cops are definitely allowing it to happen, before uh, any previous time they would not have been allowed to have that many fucking uh, that long of a of a fireworks throw without a cop showing up, so minimally the cops have decided to show their uh, show their worth to the to the... to the city by not picking by not uh breaking up fireworks displays, and a lot of people say, well that doesn't figure into how many there are or how big and expensive they are, how could afford them and things like that? uh, and how are they getting them all when that doesn't happen every year? well, i mean if you you can get a little free economics on it uh and say well because the cops aren't cuz like say x number of people in a given year are going to buy fireworks illegally to set o in the city and there's always some, but they're limited by the fact that they know they're never going to be able to light more than one or two at a time, so there's no point to buying that many, so the demand is relatively static and low, now with the cops essentially giving a a a taset green light to that, you can go hog wild, you can empty out your barrel, uh, then maybe you want to buy more of them, and then that increases demand as as as it's worth more to bring more in, um, and in that case all it takes is the the cops just turning in a blind eye and all of a sudden boom it's fireworks time thanks to the fact that it's the beginning of summer people have been couped up for months uh there's nothing else still open that's like the least invention intervention scenario most intervention scenario as we said it was like yeah the cops are the ones actually doing it uh intentionally the psychological warfare uh and as i said i don't know i don't know which one is which but i will say that uh the question and and uh the reason it's hard for me to care too much one way or the other is besides the fact that it seems like i there's no way for me to know uh is what are you going to do about it if it is what if it is a conspiracy what if the cops are doing doing it what are you going to do about it? what are you going to do about it? and the real answer is now, well no, you're going to go online and you're going to say the cops are doing this, it's like, okay, does that change the fact that it's happening every night? does it change the fact that uh that it's freaking you out a little bit, making you wonder, making you doubt yourself, making you doubt your cause, because you live in a city and you don't want fireworks going off in your windows and maybe that means the cops should be around, because if they're not, i don't know if i can really live in this city anymore, and i sure do like it. and that anxiety has to be like put away and that it's put away in in in in arguing that it has to be some sort of conspiracy theory because that you way sublimates your anxiety, it sublimates the the very fact that like there is a there is an absolute tenuousness to everyone's belief system right, like people think, oh we need to get everyone to believe x, y or z uh and then we can win uh no, you need people to have a depth of belief, their belief has has to be thick, their belief has to be have the thickness to when it encounters resistance and and there has to be a sacrifice of personal gain or comfort in order to advance it, you have to be willing to push through. well, i i'd say that a lot of the people who have political beliefs right now, and and and to the point that they even carry them around as like a signal part of their identity and their sense of virtue, they've never really been tested. they and in the sense that they've never had to put like way their political beliefs against something else that they really wanted, and like there's this gitty rush of look at what we're getting in the streets, but a lot of the people in the streets, their commitment to this cause, whatever they even imagine it to be, and not everybody is imagining it's the same thing, is essentially free for them, going out when you were quarantine is actually. positive, you get to go for exercise, you get to feel like you're a good person, you get to be outdoors without feeling guilty about being outdoors, which is what stops you from going out doing other stuff, um, it's all win, but what if the fireworks don't stop, you know, and the cops make it clear that if they're not around to stop them, they're not going to stop, and all of a sudden, maybe we need cops around, maybe police are useful, and it's like that's the point when abolished the police becomes. the police, you know, that's the point where defund the police means some cosmetic uh uh trimming of the budget, and then people, people would have said, i'll never settle for that in a million years, they've they're settling for it, why? because their beliefs have been tested a little bit, and it turns out that their maximalist commitments didn't actually uh account for having to be sacrificed for, and i think that the whole firework. thing is part of an anxiety attack about that very fear that a lot of people have, like what's going to happen, and it's and it's a real one, and the fact is we don't know what we're doing, and no one knows what they're doing, and that leads everyone of course to start creating narratives to justify everything and to uh to sooth all disquiet, but long way of saying, i have no idea what's happening with the fireworks, uh, but it's certainly having whatever. effect is, or we'll see, I guess right, we will see, we shall see, how effective it is, that's how people react to it, and that's again, I don't know, but I think a lot of the anxiety comes around, uh, the the the un, the buried and never spoken of, but but undeniable fact that whatever you want to call the left in America has no organ'. organizational being right, there's no umbrella organizations, there's no real leaders even, certainly not leaders to have any influence beyond their ability to persuade, as opposed to give orders to a hierarchy of command, and absent that, I mean, my hope is, and the only hope we have is that conditions will bring those organizations and that coordination into being, but we're at the stage now where it has people are like, what's going to happen, and more importantly, how do I know what anyone else is going to do when it happens? how can I be comfortable, how can I be? confident that whoever was with me at that last march or wherever the hell or whoever faves me on twitter is going to be there when it comes to the showdown and the thing is without a without a hierarchy without people you know in organizations that reach out branchingly to each other to know we're going to be here and know who we are, there's no way of feeling that way and that and that's why you have like this very weird uh and pointless con argument, this invested, this investment in this argument about uh uh, like for example is rioting or looting good or bad, right? and it's entirely framed by everyone who argues about it as an individual choice, like should i individually choose the person who is uh, should i individually judge the person who is um looting, should i think that they're doing a bad thing, should i think that they're a good or bad person? and that's the only, that's the only plane of argument, and when Nathan Robinson wrote that article about uh, how the guy getting canned for linking to a uh piece of research about saying that uh riots in the 60s increased support for republican positions and he said that's good because that was bad research and it's bad research because it assumes that it's the rioter's fault if people don't like riots and it's not the systems that create them and that is a completely beside the point. because there's an empirical question that has nothing to do with the individual virtue of the person who does something about its effectiveness and the thing about that question is that's unanswerable because there is no coordination, there's no mechanism to if you know it's good or bad do anything about it. all you can do is blame or uh or justify the people who do. and so a question of our riots. becomes the only thing that matters is the question of its uh virtue and like because you're not considering the the the racism that created it, you and you're condemning the people did it, no, there's a second question, they can all everyone who wits, everyone who lots can be doing it in what i would imagine a virtuous manner and i could, i believe that, i don't have any moral objections to looking, but it could still be in an objective sense, it could still be counterproductive, i'm not saying it is, but i'm saying it could be, and it's a separate question, but it's we don't even think of it, we doesn't even come to our minds because it's beside the point, because even if it was, we couldn't stop it anyway, or make it happen if it was good, because there's no mechanisms for ordering anyone to do anything, there's no organization, and that is the terror at the heart of all. that no one can confront and all of this stuff, all this like weird moralizing uh um uh conversation and argumentation and conspiracy theory shit, it's all dancing around the whole in the center, which is the lack of any direction, i don't think anything happened to Nathan Robinson, i honestly feel like he caught he he he tripped early to a a little... hole in the death star of internet internet conversation, discourse, which is that if you write a lot of words, it is highly unlikely that every any everyone will read or even most people will read them all, right? because nobody reads anything that they click to on the internet, especially if it's long, uh, they will probably read a little bit of it, and then what they will do is they will take from it, not even your argument, but the fact that you sure did put a lot of work into it, and that's a hell a lot more than... anyone else on uh the internet could say because they're all just doing two character reply tweets and emojis and shit, anybody you can write anything more than like 10,000 words in this moment of like ultra fried uh uh um attention spans is basically uh like fucking mozart and Einstein had a baby, it's like sitting down and writing something that long, I couldn't read that, and they don't, and so if you can write a lot of words and make them like coherent enough that... they don't just notice that the last uh the last you know 50 are like Lawren ipsum as long as it has internal consistency like it it it it reaches um it passes the test of like the champskiite uh universal grammar you know people think you're a fucking serious serious intellectual guy and it worked i mean and he also had the costume he had the performance he had the accent he he he really he he armored himself with every shibleth of sophistication that we as like downwardly culturally uh mobile uh wildly philistine Americans hate in each other. like as friends, but still have like a like a a terrified odd uh respect for, because we feel the lack of culture within Americans, uh, are people really, they don't like my hat anymore, god you people are so fucking fickle, jesus christ, all right, i'll take the hat off, now how you feeling about this, how's that, huh? a little guy, a little belt gentleman there, why don't i just create an organization? i know, i really should. problem is, any organization that's going to be an effective uh basis for mobilizing in this country is going to be around the workplace, and i sadly am about as disconnect. from uh the working class as you can be, like in the sense that I am not even of that class, not a capitalist, as I've said, an artisan, a pre-modern artisan, but what it means is I don't really have a lot of organic connections, I got to say it's it's it's it's nice, I need a fez, I have one, I have a fez, I think it's at our office, it's pretty baller, it's uh... It's like from the ceriac lodge of the shriners. I love that the shriners are just these cute guys who ride around in little motorcycles and dedicate uh wings to children's hospitals. They're the public, they're they're the charity arm of the freemasons. You people are aware of that right? So they're doing high-level Molic worship while riding and then riding around in little cars and riding little fezzes. ah here's the yeah the hippos here, hi guys, little hippo buddy, let's get busy, i didn't wear a f, i did wear a fez on an election live stream, yeah they're good hats, they're nice, masonry is mostly charitable work, yeah well, i guess it depends on what you consider charity. uh actually uh because executing John F Kennedy in the ritual of the killing of the king uh a reenactment of a 33rd degree masonic uh mystic uh ritual, we actually prevented the earth from being swallowed by a giant uh space succubus, so it was technically charity when we killed him. Lodge 49 pill, I am, I don't know if I've recommended that show on here yet, but Lodge 49 uh, it's actually really good, it's it is on it, it was on AMC and it and so it's got like the uh, the prestige of putterrances, but it is defiently not a prestige show in the ways the count, and that's why it got cancelled after two seasons, but it's really good, and it uh, it vibes with like everything I've been saying to kind of uncanny degree. and the guy uh the the the the guy whose books are the inspiration for the book uh uh name is i think jayvvin uh or he he wrote a a really good book of short stories that i just finished called the middle men that is really really fantastic and uh the show is really good too i really wish they got one more season it's it ends nicely and it ends it's okay as as a as it is but i really wish it got one more season. Jim Gavin, that's it, if I could get one historical figure on the podcast to would it be, that's a very interesting question. see the problem with historical figures is you get if they're too far back you bring them up to your moment and you can't ask them a question because they're screaming and star and yelling at the computer and asking what what this demon haunted contraption is? they can't have too much culture shock and time shock or they're not going to be able to even tell you anything even remotely helpful. they're going to be spend most of the time just being amazed that cars exist. but yeah like somebody from it would have to be like mid 20th century at the latest if you wanted them to be helpful if you wanted them to have any insights. opposed to just wanted to laugh at like Shakespeare just crying and staring at a zoom microphone uh somebody asked about infinite jest and about what uh what Wallis gets right or wrong about the nature of entertainment uh I would say that he gets uh he understands that an entertainment exists as a way to uh deal with loneliness uh and I think that that is a central penetrating insight and it's why his book which was written in the mid-90s is the one one is one piece of uh of of of of contemporary fiction that feels incredibly incredibly present and and of the moment because he saw that technology was going to give take our ability to entertain ourselves or our ability to to assuage loneliness to a unprecedented degree, and that's where we are now, like everything in there, the the the mind-obliterating force of the entertainment has already consumed us, like the number of people who, including myself, have allowed their lives to be derailed significantly by the pursuit of uh entertainment, uh, the only thing that I guess he didn't necessarily. anticipate was that it uh, because it's shallow and because it is a over time it loses its potency and you need more of it that it would become more interactive, you know uh, because it's not just like everyone's watching TV that has destroyed our ability to connect to one another or function uh or movies it's because we're on the computer and and that has a that has a uh that takes it to another level and that is cuuse uh entertainment like TV movies it assages loneliness by giving us a simulation of people around us for the time we're watching it, a simulated social reality that we can be a part of, but it is flat, and so the effect over time loses its potency. what the internet does is it gives you an even more richly textured and more immersive sense of social? reality, but like anything else, because it's a simulation, it loses power over time, and that's the thing that has to be remembered above all, that's why you have to spend more time on it, and you have to give more emotional investment to the time you spend on it, to make up for the fact that the mere act of being on the computer and engaging in those simulated social realities loses its ability to assuage the real human need for them. Stationary bicycle for the mind, that's pretty good, except when you're on a stationary bike you're actually getting exercise, all right, I'm being recommended the book, the man without qualities, which I've heard of but never read. uh, I will check it out. Do I know anything about Charles Harilson? You mean Charles V Harrilson, Woody Harilson's dad, the guy was in prison uh, on death row, I think for ex for uh, the contract. murder of a federal judge and is widely by some anyway considered to be a prime suspect in the Kennedy assassination. I mean I assume that's what you mean. I would love, I would love to uh rip a few bongs bong tokes with Buddy Harilson and talk about his dad, but that probably isn't a good vibe for him. It probably brings up uh bad feelings, but I got to say, if it was my dad, I would be like way into it. How could you not be? How could you not, like people get? like people get hung up on their genealogy if they just come from a bunch of dumb potato humpers in Ireland who never did anything interesting, if my fucking father might have killed Kennedy, I would really want to investigate the hell out of it, but maybe he does and keeps it quiet, and if if so then respect to him on that, I don't think there are moral humans under Antarctica, that's ridiculous. oh he says is apparently his dad and him were on good terms. did he ever ask his dad if he killed Kennedy though? because if they were on good terms and like he was gonna die in jail anyway, you think maybe he would have asked, he would have answered, you know? uh, i do not think Trump likes being president anymore, i think trump's entire life because he's fleeing from himself, he's fleeing from his uh, his wounded heart that has never healed. that he has been flitting from thing to thing in his life that he think, he's even admitted this in in interviews, his favorite song is, is that all there is, because he does a thing and it's wonderful, and then he asks himself, is that other is, and then he moves on to the next thing, and everyone who says, why did he run for president, he could have just had, he could have had his mistresses and he could have had his uh, his his tv show and everything, it's like, yeah, he was fucking miserable, he's been miserable every moment of his life, he is, he is in in more pain, psychic pain than than i could imagine. every moment of his life is just a brutal nightmare of misery, he is his center is nothing with self-loathing and anxiety, he ran for president, i mean partially to screw Obama for saying he was an idiot, but also just as something else to do, and for a while it made him feel better, seeing all those crowds and all those roobes hooting and holler at him and then beating Hillary, he was scared because he wasn't ready for it, but at the same time, haha everyone said he couldn't do it, they said it was impossible, they said i couldn't do it, and then I want folks, they never seen anything like it. they saw huge blow out, it was a landslide, he loved it, he loved it, but it all, it's all evanescence, it's all his vanity, it all falls through your fucking uh hands like sand, and now he's left at the end of it, and now because he can't do his rallies anymore, and the one he did wasn't even that well attended and was obviously poorly attended, and and uh, he about probably was happy for about five minutes and then he wasn't anymore, there was a picture taken of him coming off the a marine one back to the white house uh that is the best photograph of Donald Trump I have ever seen uh he's got his uh his got his tie undone uh he's got his hat his maga hat crumpled in one hand he's kind of like a got this sort of like days stare looks as shitty as possible best of all there's a fucking ring of makeup orange makeup on the inside of his collar the cheeto dust as it were fantastic picture. so yeah, so not being president, maybe that will make him happy, being president didn't work, maybe not being president will work, so I really don't, I i don't think he's going to, I don't think he's going to, and he couldn't admit to himself that that's true, and I don't think that he's going to like throw it or anything, but I do think that there will be beneath everything else relief, if he if he if and I think is more likely when he loses, cuz I got to say guys, I know everyone's like, don't count out. Donny, everyone's been traumatized by him owning everybody for three years, but at some point reality intervenes, you know, and I he's he is really in fucking trouble, unless he decides to in the very late, late period right before the election, to be donny uh, donny money bags, to do the helicopter drop that they have not done so far, even though it would have really helped his approval, unless they do some late late inning huge injection of money into the economy. he cannot win like as in there's no path, like there's zero chance, 20% unemployment, he's not going to win any of those um midwestern states, he's not going to win Michigan, he's not going to win Pennsylvania, he's not going to win Wisconsin, it's not going to happen, because that swing were people who were like, let's try them out and see what happens, they have and we see it in the results from uh from congressional races in the interrum, they have decided it didn't. work out too well and there's nobody else like his base there is it's the same people as ever but it's it's not enough it was never enough his base was never enough to win it was his base plus people who are disinterested enough to not vote uh who are generally democrats uh or to if they were generally democrats switch to republican and that was all a function of Hillary and Hillary being such a uniquely unlikely character such a perfect avatar for uh what people thought of as their miseration, whereas now like Biden to the degree to which he represents anything is a period, the Obama years, which seem even for, I think, non-democrats to be a period of relative calm and competence that what they would like to return to, and there's nothing Trump can do to change that, except giving everybody money uh, because he personalizes every issue about himself, which means the big fear people have that, oh all the riots are going to turn people. or reactionaries, no, they're associated with Trump, like even if they're not even if they're not woke, even if they don't believe all the stuff about prison abolition, and and uh and abolishing the police that your twitter feet does, they still are like, Trump is making this worse, Trump makes it worse, and Biden because like the idea that he's going to be Mr. Antifa, that can't stick, he's a 90-year-old white dude and he has explicitly disavowed all the antifast stuff, um, so he can't get ahead of any issue because he's the face of every issue, and every issue is bad, the question of whether now. Trump, Trump was facing Biden and Corona had not hit and a recession hadn't happened, which honestly is a big if because it looks like the recession might have actually technically started before corona hit, uh, then I think he would have a better, he might lose, but I would make him the favorite at this point, I bet the polls would probably reflect that uh, but you he's getting his ass dominated in a way that Hillary never did, not. close right now if the polls if the poll the polls within a 1% margin of error if all those states that right now have him with with biden within like a mar outside the margin of error have have a lead outside the margin of error if those hold he he he ropps he wins every state obama one in 20 2008 at least and the the the fundamentals are going to only get worse more people dead from from corona and now we recognize like all those people didn't show up to the rally in tulisa, even if they weren't scared away by Antifaw, they probably do believe that the virus is real, and honestly the degree to which people believe the virus is a real threat is the degree to which they have to recognize his his responsibility for a lot of the reason we fucked the dog so badly. so yeah, i would say that uh barring a significant intervention, an October surprise to end off. October surprises, I think that he's cooked, see somebody says, remember when Paul said Hillary was going to crush him, she never led like, she never led him in aggregate, you can put point to few outlier pulls if you want, she never led him in aggregate for this far out the way that Biden is, and she still let's not forget this, she won the popular vote by a significant margin and only lost in the... three states she couldn't lose by a combined 7000 votes, so that's like literally a coin flip basically in terms of outcome, so it's not like he beat Hillary running away with it, he barely win in basically a fluke, which is another thing people forget, because it is funny to imagine talk about how she got her ass kicked, but uh, I'm not talking about, I'm not talking about national elections anyway, I'm talking about state polls. and yeah, yeah, like there were some national polls that had Hillary up by like 10 or 12 or whatever, but state polling is pretty consistent. now the whole thing with the fucking mail and ballots, that's going to be a huge, huge continent point, and that's why I can say now, no matter what, the other side, whoever it is, is not going to accept the outcome of this election, the question is what formations will exist to channel that feeling into actual resistance, I mean we're in a crisis of political legitimacy and have been since 2000 pretty much uh you could argue maybe since the Clinton uh Clinton impeachment I don't know maybe Bork who knows but anyway we've been in a long-term slow crisis of legitimacy that is now reaching unsustainable uh uh uh speed that means that every election now is going to ration it up and probably significantly more than previously and I think this election is going to be a... ratchet point of of just generalized uh rejection of of the authority that that has emerged from the proper channels, but I would say this, I think that's actually good news for the left and one of the few bright spots we have, because I've been thinking about electoralism lately and the big argument against doing electoral politics from. your uh your anarchists, your tankies, whatever have you, whatever you want, any of your anti-electoral leftists is that you can't change the system from within, they won't let you, it exists to perpetuate capitalism, they're not going to allow you to just take it over, and the thing is that's basically correct, yeah, I don't think anyone at the at the level of like detail thinks that that wouldn't happen, uh, the problem is in America, just saying that doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of Americans who have political identities. don't agree with that, or aren't radical enough for that to care, because the degree to which they want to change things can be accommodated in their mind by elections, because they're not as radical as you. and they never will be, because you cannot do it through persuasion, and that is the fantasy that the the the the newspaper handing out leftists used to uh, used to satisfy themself with, and now that they're online, they can delute themselves even more. no, with a click of a finger, i can meme, i can meme on thousands of people, yeah, you can meme on thousands of people, they're just going to see it as some more bullshit on the internet. It has no impact, none of this stuff impacts or very little of it anyway, but the causes impact is things like the person being in a in a position materially to be accommodating to those messages. I'm talk, of course, I'm only talking about the half of people who do vote. The assumption that the other half who don't are all politically engaged though, I don't agree with. I think they have made a a ideological decision that voting doesn't apply to them, but I think they extend that to politics in general, if you disagree you can, but i i it doesn't seem to me to track frankly. um, so most people though, they're like, oh yeah, no, they won't allow a revolution through elections, but i don't really care about a revolution, i would like to be at healthcare or something, and the task for the non-electoralist is to get that person on board with revolution, right? to get them past that point of just wanting a little bit of crumbs from master's table and wanting the... the whole thing, what do you do? well, the non-electoral strategy is to just yell at them until they change their mind. i mean i don't know what else, if there's others to it something tell me, but that is the argument, it's like well you post, you post and remind people that they're wrong and eventually enough of them will see that and they'll agree with you. uh, i mean you can try that, but it's like trying to empty a fucking bucket uh, it's trying to empty, it's it's trying to bail out your boat with a straw, it's just it's not, it's not cost or time effective. Now what you need before you can realistically uh uh believe that you're going to get a a a a um before you could even come close to getting a critical mass of people for revolutionary change to endorse revolutionary change as in confronting the state to the point of violence and then willing to take the consequences for that to get there before you can get there you need need a critical mass of people have rejected the authority of the stage and what that what you have to get is you get you have to get enough people to realize for themselves, not cuuse you yell it at them, that the system won't accomodate their demands, and the way you do that is you present the system with an electoral outcome that it cannot metabolize, and when it can't metabolize that outcome, it rejects it, and that reduces. among the people you need to have legitimately reduced for, and that means that they are more willing to listen to more confrontational strategies and enact those confrontational strategies, because the first option is off the table, in their mind, because now they know it doesn't matter, now they know they saw it, they didn't get it yelled at them online, they saw it, they saw somebody that they wanted to win win. and then they saw that win nullified. now right now we're only at the we're we're seeing that happening, we're seeing places where you have one party republican rule, enforcing one party republican rule by denying elections to not even revolutionary democrats, not even not even socialist democrats uh and then you're seeing the phenomenon of the uh these capitalist democratic party not allowing the socialist Bernie Sanders from getting its nomination, now that act has reduced. legitimacy of the Democratic Party for a lot of people who otherwise and before this had faith in it, and so if there is a purpose to electoralism it is to try to create an electoral coalition that will advance candidates who just cannot be accepted in the current moment, and the bar for acceptance is going to get lower and lower as conditions get worse and worse, because because uh profit. is going to be skinter uh, there's going to be even less room for any kind of public investment or outlay as as the few remaining wealthy people loot the the the court the the stumbling uh uh near death body of of the of the state and that means that they will just not accept electoral vote uh outcomes and only in an environment where that's happening where people are seeing their uh their votes being cassed out in front of them and this election is going to do that no matter what we're already seeing just in this year the number of uh the number of state primaries that have flouted basic basic standards for even like close to being a fair. and yet having those results all certified and counted as though nothing had happened. now of course, it's it's it's not everyone is simultaneously having some moment of realization, it's a gradual process, people reach a point of where whereby they can no longer sustain the fiction to themselves anymore and then they have to discard it, and that's a different people have different, like what that um, what that limit is is different for it. every person, but uh, if you have enough of those elections that are like that, it's going to keep happening no matter what, unevenly, but eventually you're going to have something like a uh, a a a a a foundational mass of people a threshhold of people who are ready to do something other than wait for the next election, because they know it won't matter, they know it won't matter in a way that you'll never convince them won't matter online. i have not read Martin the hagland sounds interesting best chain pizza that's an interesting one because chain pizza is really generally some of the worst pizza you can get um Papa jones is inedible fucking tire rubber uh i have a child uh appreciation I will admit for pizza hut, but you know what, thinking about it, the best chain pizza is the super ultra thin crust from Dominos, which is legitimately good, so uh, I was mostly just thinking of little caesars and Papans pretty disgusting, but the Detroit style classic pie that pizza huck puts out is decent, and uh, man, really, really, really like the thin crust, extra thin crust dominoes with with the square. pieces uh, but regionally, regional chains, I've never had jets, even though I lived in Cincinnati, people say it's good, it looks uh, I did like donados though in Cincinnati, which is another uh thin crust, but pizza hut, I mean I think anyone grew up in the Oregon trail generation like I did has a prustian association with pizza hut, because pizza hut would have things like book it. which was a program where you got a little piece of paper and you would go home and you would write a book read a book and when you uh when you finish the book you got a sticker and then you had enough stickers you get a free personal ban pizza at pizza that's also the place where you go after a softball game or something a family birthday it was like it was it was an event place because it had it had like this dark interior that that was it simulated fanciness kind of even before things like olive garden existed, it simulated this sort of like mid-century uh supper club ambiance, it was very dark, they had red banquets, they had a salad bar, uh, and for a long time they were the number one uh, one of the number one uh, one of the top American purchasers of kale because they used it to um, edge the salad bar, not to eat, but just to edge it, yes, the green lamps, the pubble, the pebbled brown plastic cups, the big foot, you go to play softball, you get you get done, they put the big foot in front of you, they don't make the big foot anymore, but that was a hell of a pie. um, so yeah, pizza hut will always have like, i mean it's not a thing that i eat ever uh, because it's not the same, it's the the the delivery, it's mostly delivery and like i live in a city, it's like pizza hut, it's not going to be, it's not going to be the awesome classic building with the weird that weird temple roof, i don't even know what you call those, um, it's just like a a store front, it's like what am i? i'm not getting, i'm not getting, i'm not getting that memory back, i'm not getting that sense of child mussalge back, just from the pizza, you know, even though you get a little madadeline action, you got to get that, you got to have the pebbled glass cup in your hand, yeah, it's a roof, fuck you, what do you call it? I was a pogota roof, that's it, thank you, and I would never go to a piece of hot taco bell combo, I have not talked to uh, I think that maybe Bowman will win, or I mean Booker will win in Kentucky, I don't know, I wouldn't be surprised if he loses, especially now that they're shutting all the polling places down and not not giving people their absent ballots. but I have a hard time imagining either of them her or Mc Grath beating uh McConnell, but I would certainly rather have Bucker be the candidate thank because there is a there is a a scenario, there's a not unposible scenario where there is a nationwide anti-republican wave, if things are bad enough and it's associated closely enough with the ruling party that McConnell could actually lose, of course I would love that. I mean I've hated Mitch McConnell more personally as as a person than I've hated any American politician because when I was a little fucking civics nerd uh I thought campaign finance would be the answer to everything and my my senator my hero Rust Fingold was one of the chair one of the chief supporters of campaign finance and the point man to oppose him was Mitch McConnell the guy who would say who would willingly go out to say the thing that republicans were generally too embarrassed to say which was uh I believe that my corporate doners are exercising their free speech. which is embarrassing to say, you just sound like a fucking licks bittle, but he was shameless and as a result the money flowed through him, uh, so yeah, I remember hating him, he was like the evil, the evil old uh gargamel looking motherfucker in the senate trying to make sure that uh the only people who had influence in government were zillionaires i have of course uh evolve beyond the pat the the the moment of thinking that uh campaign finance is is really meaningful at the moment, but it was an early fight that I had a rooting interest in and I've hated McConnell ever since, and I was like a fucking teenager, so I would love to see him lose, I would love to see him eat shit, but uh, it's probably not going to happen, I mean the guy was hanging out with fucking Rand Paul when Ran Paul was just a teaming peetry disc of coronavirus didn't even come down with it, evil evil is a is a... bar is a protective barrier at a certain level, you get enough, you spill enough blood and it starts coating you in a protective shell. McConnell, Kentucky definitely has a couple of the worst senators. McConnell is like definitely the worst senator and then Ran Paul is top 10 probably. Evil people are not happy, evil people are suffering like everybody is, uh, evil people are able to more extravagantly indulge distraction and... and and uh and solus from suffering, temporary, but you know, the wicked flee what none pursueth. "I will say that like truly evil people are probably happier than the average person just because they can feel like they have some control over their lives, because by definition to be evil, you have to be able to do evil, and to do evil you have to have power, so if you have power in life, that is its own narcotic that most of us can't even imagine how it feels, like that's probably the fent nail of human emotions is the power over other people, and of course you know it's it's fleeting like everything uh, but in the moment it must be incredibly seductive um uh I thought that uh Vice, the Madam McCave movie had its problems uh and that he's still fundamentally a liberal in certain ways in terms of his analysis that makes it hard for him to to basically to not get distracted like that movie he's kind of like a big puppy and he keeps like running off the track to like bark a rabbit or something like unity unitary executive theory or like Fox News it's like these are all sort of subsidiary to a larger point though. actually making, but it's not, it's not like narratively satisfying enough for him because it's too abstract, but the scene in Vice that I think is brilliant, the best scene in the movie, and the movie and the scene that that most, I think does the best job of actually uh explaining people in power beyond their ideology, which is secondary, it's the scene uh, it's in the 70s when when uh uh chany is uh Nixon's is in the Nixon White House. is in the nixon white house and they're standing in front of Nixon's office door uh and Shany goes what's going on and rumsfel said he's in there with Kissinger. they're planning bombing a Cambodia and they show they cut between a shot of like a a an asian like rice field like farmers and like some tree canopy and like you can hear like a b52 or something and then back to this this door and Rumsfeld starts talking about how yeah you know they're going to say a name they're going to write thing down and some people on the other side of the world are going to die and it gives a sense of the awe infused deduction of that kind of power over human life, and it definitely reminds you that of course you would turn that into ritual, of course you would ritualize that, of course things like bohemian grove exist, of course Epsteen does what we all thought he did, because you need the amount of concentration, mental concentration and will and application of will it takes to get to that level. you essentially need a imaginat something to pick up all that overflowed imaginative anima and so that means that you're not just going to want to go in that room and and blow up that fucking village, you're going to want to reenact it the way that serial killers do, and that's where all the ritual shit comes in, all the weird shit, and sallow is a perfect example of it, yeah sallow. exp understands that, i am not setting off the fireworks, thank you very much, i mean i' there apparently are pictures of there's videos of cops setting off fireworks so to some degree. Yes, but all of them, no, absolutely not. What am I getting for dinner? I think I have a pokeeball, pokeball, uh, Paul, Paul, you hear about this? Pokeball, you got any gum, you got any gum, my favorite crypted is the moth man, because the moth man stands in for so much specific shit, it's fascinating, like that entire experience, the point pleasants, is uh fascinating because the moth man is only a small part of it, there's a whole, it was an absolute explosive growth in um UFO sitings all across that region, but not just like lights in the sky shit, although there were lights in the sky almost every night for like a year until the fucking until the point pleasant uh bridge collapsed and they've been away, very weird uh, but like encounters, close encounters people like having a fucking driving on the highway, having a a a spaceship drop in front of them, guys come out, take them into the ship and fly them around, that kind of stuff, um, the men in black visiting people, like weirddos in suits, asking odd questions and sounding like robots, uh, and then you have the fact that the whole thing was documented by this John, by John Keel, this guy, John Keil in the book, uh, the book man prophecies, who was most likely some sort of conartist. or uh fraudster himself and it's it's a perfect exaggerated uh reflection of the coming sense of vertiginous unreality that will would come to like totally dominate our our modern space uh in in and the irony there is it was occurring in like the crucible of like the the very the very the the the the tail end of the d the the the the high modernist. right, like the moment of when when when uh positivism when when like social positivism had reached its most hegemonic faith and ability to uh to influence reality uh and at the same time you're having a phenomenon occurring in this town uh where if you just read the kill book you would have no idea you could not especially in a time when there was no internet and everyone basically believed what they read in the papers, how could you make sense of it? and I've always thought that you could do something really interesting creatively with moth man, uh, but it would have to hinge on you never finding out. Who the moth man is, and it you know, and and presenting in the thing itself, different realities without picking between them, like, I mean, maybe it was an MK Ultra thing, maybe they dosed the town's water supply, and that's what's so terrifyingly depressing and awful about the moth man prophecy movie that got made, which is just like a exp. Moody ripoff with Richard Gearres John playing him as just absolutely dower Dork, boring as hell, tries to be scary, which is absolutely the wrong play. Roth man movie is a comedy above all else. Uh, yes, I have watched falling down and I think falling down is a really good movie, uh, one of Schumacher's better films and I saw some people today taking the opportunity to say that uh, that it's bad. because the protagonist is relatable in any way, which it does make me feel like we've lost an ability to appreciate aesthetics due to the politicization of everyday life, but it's because we've politicized politics in the worst way, we've politicized politics at the level of symbolic action and not real action, and of course that's because we lack real political action and we create a symbolic order to stand in for it, that's bad. and it is our challenge to try to get back to a real life where you have real political action and not symbolic representation of that action online, but what the the so we have depositicized real lives, but hyperpoliticized symbolic lives, which means we invest a lot of political thought into our entertainment, a level I believe we didn't used to do, and it's not because we're better people or more woke, it's because we're more anxious about our inability to affect the world around us and we want. make up for that anxiety by applying some sort of political lens to art and convincing ourselves that by seeing things in films and in television that reconfirm our values that we're getting anywhere, you're not getting anywhere, you're you're on the the hell treadmill uh, but you want to feel like you're getting somewhere, and so you invest politics into into entertainment, and that means that you're not, because you can never, you can't pay attention to everything. movie, you know, you have to pick a a lens to watch a movie through, a heuristic, and a political heuristic is about the most creatively and artistically uh, deadening and unrewarding heuristics you can use to look at art. you can look at art politically and you should at some point and in some way, but as the as the governing heuristic to to look at a piece of art through, it's the worst way to do it, because everything that actually makes up film, everything that actually makes up the art form, cinematography, editing, sound design, um, act uh, performances, sheen as lex would call it, none of that, none of that really is the political content, you know, so you end up pushing this all, get this shit out of my way, and you end up what you end up looking for is cuuse most movies have rela because they're not political documents, their politics are relatively thread bear and easy to find and um and not supported by much, there's not much art to them, so you missed all the actual art in a piece of art to pull out these like uh to pull the nat shit out of pepper and then to declare the the the work of art good or bad depending on what those politics are, you can do that, but it is an unrewarding way to do it, and that's what. by people who do that have such hysterically over determined and emotionally involved opinions on this shit, so there are people walking around to say that falling down is a bad movie because it makes you identify with the protagonist. creating a relatable protagonist that the audience is invested in is one of the hardest things you can do, most movies can't even do it, falling down pulls it off masterfully, that makes it a good movie. the only argument that is bad is is is v chip ass shit about how people are going to see it and then carry it out, which we never had a conversation about how that is now the new left-wing model for dealing with artistic representation after it after denying it for years under free speech arguments. Look, see, I didn't sa, see this person is trying to catch me by saying, I said cinematography is not related to politics. Obviously not, it's in everything, I am saying it is not first, it is a reflection, if you're looking in a film politically, most people are not looking at it through the lens of the cinematography and then figuring out what the politics is from that, they're looking at themes and dialogue, if you want to, if you want to try to say I'm wrong about that, you can, but I, I don't say that I'm, I'm I'm saying that that you could depoliticize aesthetics, obviously you can't, but that's not how peop are engaging with them, they're ignoring the aesthetics, how many, how many reviews of movies do you see anymore that talk about the aesthetic elements of film, they talk about the themes and the characters almost exclusively, and in moral terms, because they politicized, they have a politicized uristic, the cinematography is still telling a political story, but they aren't even getting that far into it. i would like some hanging plants, it's nice out here, but yeah, a few plants would be nice too, i i might get out some hangers, i don't really have a green thumb, the problem is it doesn't really get dark back here, so i don't know, i need something that doesn't require a lot of light, skyline is not bad, i know i probably just destroyed my credibility with half the audience there, but skyline, it looks bad and there's a reason they dump half a pound of uh cheese on top, it's to disguise the diarrhea looking fucking cheese und uh chili underneath it, but it's actually pretty good and more importantly than pretty good, it's unique, it's really hard to get anywhere else and it's it's interesting and it's worth trying, oh trying to say who we are in the the soviet thing. Amber is definitely stalin and she would agree, beyond that I don't know. What's the most dudes rock movie ever made? That's actually a good question. I don't know if I could say most, I haven't seen enough movies probably, but uh, um, like of movies I can think of, a movie that really gets the vibe, Magic Mike XXL. Magic Mike XXL is dude's rock, the movie. uh, but magic mike is a okay movie, it's very well shot uh, all the dance scenes are great, but uh, it's got some real problems, mainly that it stars as the love interest, this uh girl, Alex Horn, I think her name was, who was like the the daughter of some studio executive, she also had like a five season, five episode arc on the office, and and it was just perfect studio nepotism, and she was such a zero, and the way you know that she was truly talentless is that even with her dad. being a studio executive, she never got any other work, and so she was just and Alex Pedifer played her brother and they're just zero charisma losers and it also has this like weird moralistic thing about like drug use, the sequel which technically was not directed by Stephen suderberg, although apparently he did all the cinematography, uh, is it removes everything bad and clunky about the first one, all the plot, it removes plot, it removes roman like romantic uh uhrang and it is a story. three of them so the guy so it starts magic mark ends magic mark magic mike ends with chatting he's like i think i got to be serious i'm going to go make wood and it starts he's broken up with the awful girl thank god and he's got his company he's actually doing it he's doing the thing that he always said he would in the first movie he's making furniture uh and but he still loves the rumba he loves the dance there's a great scene where he's like drilling a table and he hears pony and he just starts dancing it's great uh but he gets he gets contacted by the old guys and it's like hey we're going to this thing, you want to come to this stripper convention? and he's like, sure, and there are so many moments in this movie where they could have included bullshit plot complications and drama, like he has this company, maybe the company is not sewing so good and they needs to he needs money and there's a cash prize that they have to win at the stripper convention, and maybe when they get to the stripper convention, they're evil strippers so they have to beat, um, nope, it's just let's go to the convention, doesn't even show if they won or loss. uh and maybe they show if they won, but literally I don't remember because it was that unimportant, and then the whole movie itself is just guys being dudes in the best way. there's a whole scene where it's it's one of the few movies uh that's like about the female gays in that there are extended sequences where men are just wildly objectified by women and they love it because they want to make the women happy and uh the stakes are non-existent which is dude's rock requirement because you have to be centered and you can't have outtsized uh investment in the world around you you got to be able to just abide uh and then my favorite thing is so this is my absolute favorite thing about this movie, so Chantom hooks up with his old dancing partners and there's one guy there who gives him the business, he's like looking at him kind of like, and the camera like follows him kind of giving him the eye, and it's established, oh this guy's got a problem with Channic, and that's exactly the kind of thing they set up so that like right before the big finale, like they get betrayed by him, you know, nope, one scene later after he's been frosty to chanting and show you know not. just for our benefit, but channing tatoms noticed too, he comes up to him and he goes, hey buddy, you okay, you seem like you got a problem, and he says, I'm mad at you cuuse you left when we were struggling, and he's like, I'm sorry man, but you knew I wanted to do the stuff with the furniture, uh, I love you guys, and he's like, I love you too, squashed, done, never comes back, relationship is good, it's men who are who are secure in their their sexuality, their mask. uh the their uh worth as people and they operate from from like a pure purity of intention, beautiful, it's the dudes, i'm glad someone asked that, it is the most dudes rock movie i'm aware of magic mike xxl, dude's rock is also uh big labawsky is kind of dude's rock uh although Walter doesn't really rock, he's a little too uh, he's he's a little, he's he's a little too high strong. All right, there we go, do an hour, I somebody says, Magic Mike XXL is a divorced dad movie, I don't, I wouldn't say that, does Mike Davis hate you guys, I sure hope not, I respect him a great deal. I think he's very good, he's written, he's done very well, his book uh, prisoners of the American Dream is one of the most precient pieces of uh social literature, he absolutely nails where we would be now, then so I don't know why you asked that, I hope he hasn't been saying bad things about us, I hate it, I'm I'm bumed out enough that Rick Prosty doesn't like us, but we might be able to talk to him for the new book, so that would be cool, I'm very much looking for. to reading it, it's out in uh advanced copies, i think i'm going to get one so i'm going to start it soon and i oh i am doing the bird man hand for that and i love the fact it's 900 pages and it's about the fucking carter years just the least culturally examined uh presidential era and uh i haven't i didn't get to watch trump. speech was I'm a little bumed about, I saw some of the highlights, I might watch the whole thing, him getting cheered to for drinking the water, was really a truly mind-breaking experience, because that's one of those moments where you actually break away some of the levels of acceptance that you've done to sort of accommodate reality and you strip at the bark and you just see a roomful of people risking death to to give a round of applause to an old man for successfully drinking a glass of water with one hand, holy fuck, they were, they were, they were proud of him for for drinking, they thought that they had owned the left and the fake news media by him drinking from a glass of water, they had a kyron on fox news that swear to god describing his conversation, his explanation for why he did that was uh Trump explains didn't he uh held glass with two hands to avoid tie getting wet, but here's the thing, Donald, everybody who's drinking doesn't want, nobody wants the... tie to get wet if they're wearing a tie, nobody wants their drink to go into their their chest, that's never the intention of anyone who's going for a drink, you're not unique in that, the thing is most people can do it one-handed, him going, no, no, no, I wanted to make sure there was no water on my tie, it's a silk, silk tie, I didn't, so I had, it's like, so I had to use the other hand, it's like, well, I didn't have to use the other hand, nor did most people, nor did most people aren't in in in a home, but that's the kind of thing, like I can't, I don't think he's happy talking about why, I don't think that he's talking, reassuring everybody for 20 minutes about the ramp and how slippery it was, I don't think he feels cool, I don't think he feels like he's owning anybody, I think he feels like why do I have to explain, why don't people believe that I that it was slippery, come on. gets mad, i understand that dunking on the cheeto is pass say, but i mean it is, i don't want to deny what's right in front of my face just to maintain some sort of ideological purity, i mean i'm confident enough my eye beliefs that i can say that trump is still pretty funny and that he is also hilariously absurd and that the motherfucker can't drink with one hand and that that's funny to me, i'm sorry, i'm not going to stop noticing the world around me just because it's not the material conditions of... everything, i'm going to have a look around, it's an aesthetic enjoyment, same as looking at a nice field of sunflowers, will any component of the liberal order side with verificable truth? Thing is there is no, nothing can institute, there there is no verifiable truth because it can no longer be enforced. We have a situation where any news that comes up, given the way that it's presented and by whom it's presented, will be disbelieved by half of the people, and that has literally killed hundreds of, it's going to kill hundreds of thousands of people in this country, the fact, the fact of that is going to literally kill hundreds of thousands of people in this country or contribute to their deaths anyway, because like... if people really believed what the media was telling them about coronavirus when they need when it when it mattered, they would not have acted the way they did, they acted the way they did because they didn't believe it, and the thing is is that there is no political reason, there is no rational reason for them to disbelieve it, right? like i mean, unless you unless you've accepted the idea that you're under like hostel occupation, if you accept that like you live in a social order that has relatively functional institutions. when everything tells you, every news channel uh tells you, every doctor tells you, all these institutions tell you that this is a real virus, because like that's not a political question, whether or not people die from a virus, right? you would process that as okay, there's a virus and we can tell that because other countries that's what happened, in a lot of other countries that's what they said, it's like oh virus, okay, half of our people said, oh virus, no, and that's going to be true no matter what, nothing can change. that in the in the near term anyway, in the current moment that cannot change, so there's no reasserting a a a top-down narrative agreed upon truth that can be assured to do anything else than ensure half people won't believe it, depending on where it comes from, so it's done, that's that's over, we we will never be operating from the same playbook and again and that is terrifying cuz it it made it almost impossible to deal with covid and it will make it impossible to deal with climate change, but like i said there's a flip side that's positive to that, because yes we're losing a a common understanding, we're losing common faith in institutions, but that includes the political process, and as i said critical alienation from the electoral process. is necessary to establish a new uh critical mass of activists who are willing to challenge capital directly. I would like to play stream crusader kings yes uh I will it. "i will agree with someone who pointed out that a lot of people didn't believe in covid because they couldn't afford to, right? their livelihood it depended on it, and there was no alternative, and they never developed one, and that's why I said we eventually gave up on the on the quarantine because we're like, fuck it, uh, but I do think that that it was a self-reinforcing cycle where one of the things that made it impossible to operate to act quickly is you couldn't just tell people stay home and wear a mask." You couldn't just say that and hit a button and have them take you seriously. Now sure, the our critical capacity to respond was minimal, but even that was compromised further by this lack of an agreeed upon uh reality. All right, I think I'm going to ask answer a question, one more question and then I'm gonna. siidle off cowboys and girls, old cow folks, uh somebody asked us to comment on class reductionists uh undermining or uh minimizing black lives matter uh i will leave on this note i'll drop the mic here and just say i don't think class reduction is is is a thing and i don't mean that in the sense of like classifying people like oh wouldn't you say somebody who believed x y and z was a i am saying that since no one self-identifies as one it's purely a term of... uh of, it's a term of abuse, it's a term used to pre-sort someone, the same way like SJW is, presort someone into a a range of uh beliefs that aren't theirs, they're yours, you get to fill that term with what you wanted to mean, and then you apply it to somebody else, and then they have to like go through the fucking mash of trying to cut through your imposed idea of what they believe on what? they actually believe, I saw somebody uh yesterday um, they were saying like, oh, these class reductionists, you know, they they act like there's no material impact from racism, trust me, there is, it's like, I know plenty of people who get called class reductionists, not one of whom would believe that, in fact they would believe the opposite, they would say that's what, it's that's so true and it's so central that that's what you should focus on, and so they have you, there's a difference of... tactics and strategy and analysis that is just being ignored, no, no, no, we're assuming my conditions first, we're assuming my my description of these things first, and then you get to work from that, I mean, you can try that and in group, it works, because you're sorting people by whether or not you're they're going to be, they're going to be cast away, cuz if you get the class reduction is mark on you, just threatening someone to call someone that inside a group works, because they don't want to get called that. because it has impact to them, problem, people who aren't outside, they don't give a shit if you call them it because they they say i don't care or they don't even know what a fuck is supposed to mean, it's it's a it's a hex that doesn't have any effect on people who aren't already uh in the covin, so if you're using that word to me, i just think how can i even talk about this because you've already loaded the gun and put it on the table, like you have to talk about like a specific issue and a specific approach to it. so yeah, but see, see some people are calling themselves slash, that's fine, but like I said, this guy who was explaining what clash reductionism was, in a youtube video by the way that was supposed to be explanatory for like, hey, are you a leftist? well, let me explain some things for you, by like debating shit, and he goes, oh destructionism, they don't think there's a material basis, that racism as a material reflection, that's wildly wrong, but it's on, but here's the thing, he doesn't think it's wrong. he gets to defer define the terms, but she's that mean, you can't, you can't assume that, for a neutral audience, you can't assume that, and you should always assume a neutral audience if you want to be persuasive. all right, i hope some of that made sense, talk to you guys soon.
