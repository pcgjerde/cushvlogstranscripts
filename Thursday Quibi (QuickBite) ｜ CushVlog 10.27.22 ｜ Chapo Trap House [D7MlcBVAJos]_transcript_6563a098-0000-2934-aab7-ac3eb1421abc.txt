 metal band out of denton were a couple of guys who've been friends since grade school, one was named cyrus, the other was Jeff, don't all a day in Jeff's bedroom, best ever death metal band out of Denton, never settled on a name, but the top three contenders after weeks of debate, saint and fingers and the killers and the hospital bombers. for death metal band out of den cirus. in their hearts, they were headed for stage lights and lear jets, and fortune and fame, so inscript that made prominent use of a pentagram, they stencil their drumheads and their guitars with their names, and that was how cyrus got sent to the school where they told him, he'd never be famous, that's how we wait jeff, and the letters he'd write to his friend, help develop, plan to get even, when you punish a person for dreaming his dream, don't expect him to thank or forgive you best ever death metal band out of dentin will in time both i pace and all live you hail satan halel tonight hail saint halel hey folks this is going to be a short one i don't have a lot of time got to record some stuff later squeezing it in because i want to get something in this week try keep up a pace once a week because I want to do another book as I said that I have not yet decided on, but when I get back from Florida, Florida, next week, I will pick one and we'll say what it is. Florida, first time in the tip, never been to the tip, never been to the sensitive glands of Florida before, only the shaft, I've been all the way in the middle of the shaft and up into the uh, the h is the pan handle, pan is not the scrotum right, but it's not the taint either, there's no scrotum, is the problem, what's the pan handle, see if it's the taint, where's the balls? this is the problem, i guess the root, all right, people are keeping insisting it's the taint, even though there's no balls between it and the rest, it goes shaft, it goes straight to shaft, florida is absolutely circumcised, i mean i think that goes without saying. if you know what I mean? All right, fine, it's the taint. Well, I've been to the taint and I've been to the bottom, the middle of the shaft, uh, the uh, tampa area, and that ben of course, of course is an American, middle American in Ven to Orlando, where else you going to go? That is your hoge, when you're from a lower to middle, middle class family in the midwest, the hodge is Orlando. I've never done to Jacksonville on the other side, which is yeah, the root part, the root of the dick up where it hits the the uh abdomen, seems like a real hell, which honestly makes it interesting to me, uh, just like another one of those anti-cities that just decides to negate the concept of urbanity, say hey, you know how the whole point of a city is that things are easily accessible and close to... fuck that and very funny of course also is the fact that uh you know it's got a vastly higher crime rate than basically any of the uh out of control democrat run cities in the country but again all you need is to have a public performance of of punishment, a public performance of of law enforcement and veneration for law enforcement, and what actual, the actual amount of crime you have doesn't matter, because how the hell does anybody know? nobody knows, the only people who know are on an individual level, the people who individually uh part of it, are victims or perpetrators of crime, for the most part are not part of anybody is under of the public and uh can't speak with one voice, so all it is is the filtered and then ritually reinscribed violence of crime. or whatever the hell we mean by that, and uh, it's created a situation where people have talked themselves into believing that uh, that they are part of a meaningful stand for like virtues if they sign on to a political project that acknowledges crime, you can acknowledge it all day long, everybody is doing the same thing everywhere, there is no radical alternative to america. because approach to crime or any other social problem, everybody's doing basically the same thing, there are there are uh um significant superficial alterations, like the sconces, the escuchans, the all that shit, the wain scotting, those are all different, but it base it's all the same stuff, poverty has been essentially criminalized everywhere. but then some places decide to create little ornamental uh amiliative rituals to imply that you know we don't like that or that we want it to be otherwise as opposed to other places that just uh publicly reaffirm the virtue of that approach to uh social decline and then you get to vote on one or the other and wow you get to then participate in observing a a media invention of the relationship between the citizens and and their government and between the government and and crime and and and it's all chosen what is what what what becomes stories is chosen kind of subconsciously but also uh very deliberately uh to affirm some narrative that creates uh a meaningful like sides but what is happening at base is identical so anyway yes Florida uh the tip gonna go to the tip gonna go to the glands Miami very interested very intrigued never been want to be there don't know how long it's got as a city I mean forget global warming the fucking buildings might all collapse before it even gets to that point uh so that'll be interesting you know I kind of do I am intrigued by this game. Victoria 3, it does seem more in my wheelhouse uh than univerpal, usuverpal, universal uniperalis, universal Europa, that's the one uh, but I don't know, I always get a headache, I look at a map, I look at the map and immediately I'm like, I don't care, I just can't do it, there's something you got to have that makes you like wired into that stuff, and I just don't have it. Oh, I didn't know that uh, the Mike Davis has a has a last book that he put out, and what a shock, it's called capitalism and apocalypse, I can't believe it, might be a good one to dive into, I think I might read that pretty soon after the China book, maybe, but I got to do a China book first, see, I'd rather just, if I want to do - a counterfactual history, I'll just do it in my... head and then I don't have to worry about like clicking on the little screens and then I got to move the knobs around and I don't know what any of that means it doesn't mean anything to me it feels like doing homework it feels like doing a real job like a real like spreadsheet job no thank you I'll just I'll just let my mind do it I'll just fall into my uh I'll just play I'll just rotate the cube of the map in my mind and move things around. and also i do think that the that there is something insidious about that approach like that the the assumption of those games that there's like this immortal spirit being you know that you are basically a god of the nation moving it in in towards a destiny like that is happening that happens in every nation but it is not. where the technological structure has fully subborned the humans uh make up like critical elements of the circuit of it. for now they do anyway and so when you play a game uh one of these games like your your imagined perspective is of the machine itself and i think that's the appeal of the game to leftis is the idea what if the machine had a different programming what if i speaking of acting on behalf of you the the people, the human race, expressed, you know, through the self-knowledge of of a class, was directing its energies rather than this this other thing, this this profit imperative that operates it as we operates it now, and it uh dictates our reality, and I guess that's interesting, but again too much. too many clicks, so anyway, as I said, this is going to be a short one, I got about a half an hour here, so I'll take some questions and answers, maybe talk to some folks, just chill, and again anybody I know any other Chinese books, throw them in there, apparently though, in this new Victoria game you can uh, you can abolish. very quickly, like you can basically have the wigs take over in the 1830s, which is a very intriguing concept, but you know uh, obviously raises the question of how does southern society deal with that? okay, well never mind, apparently there is no last Mike Davis book, I was surprised, I would have, I thought I would have heard of it. Oh. Okay, this is a good one, favorite 30 years old, 30 years war minor character, there are a lot of great ones, uh, it's a Rogue's gallery, some real entertaining characters, I'm a big fan of Poppenheim, uh, Poppenheim was a was a uh, imperial general uh had been born and raised protestant, but then converted to catholicism, joined the imperial army, and then vowed to take a wound on his body for every year that he spent as a heretic. uh and he put down with savagery a revolt in upper Austria in the beginning of the war uh and he got shot uh and killed at Lutson right before Gustavus Adolphus and you can still find the orders that Wallenstein sent him stained with blood uh so that's I like Poppenheim a lot just because he's uh I yeah Bernardox Weimar is is a character I mean they're all either fanatics or complete uh sociopats like that's the... there are very few, you can't really even squint and find anybody remotely like to root for, you know, anybody to feel like an affinity for across history, because those people had no part in this particular war, it's it's religious fanatics and completely vacant sociopaths, uh, like the only exceptions are people who were essentially uh uh extranious to the process and and in uh classical reading rereading retellings of the story always come off like the biggest chumps like John George of Saxony. John George was the elector of Saxony. He was the paramount Lutheran elector in the Holy Roman empire. And he had no truck with Fredrick's attempt to take the Bohemian crown. He didn't want anything to do with the original the thing that sparked the war. And so he was uh, he was neutral until Gustavus invaded, the Sweds invaded, and at first he tried to stay neutral even after the Swedes had invaded. Uh, but after uh, he proved his. military power, he essentially was forced to side with uh Sweden, uh, which lasted until after Lson at which point he's he helped negotiate the peace of Prague and became uh uh neutral again and then eventually supporting the emperor, this guy is looks like a feckless weeney, like a no balls motherfucker compared especially to chads like Gustavus Adolphus and like a guy like Wallensteen who is not like a military genius but is uh absolutely a fascinating figure and and in his own way is a logistical and uh financial genius uh and you got this guy just flowing floating around with a tide, but you can recognize, at least i can recognize in Jean George, like how I imagine I would have responded to the specific phenomenon of the 30 years war, you know, the defenstration of Prague and all that shit, like the calvinist, like that's the thing, Frederic was a calvinist, the the the uh the faction uh of german protestants. who who uh started the whole thing by taking the bohemian crown were not even lutherans and lutherans like John George considered calvinists as wrong uh and uh as essentially heretical as catholics were so he didn't want to fucking fight at every point he was essentially forced to fight and i think that is the same humane uh response to those conditions but he also looks like a fucking chump you know he looks like this loser oxen oh god there's so many good ones oxen sterna fuck i mean uh the mel Christian of Brunswick uh is fun because he essentially uh he was one of the few catholic princes who held on after white mountain and he ran around Europe trying to organize armies and get subsidies to fight the emperor all through the law uh before the the danish intervention and part of the reason he was doing it is because he was incredibly horny for Fredrick's wife Elizabeth the daughter of James the first, I do read fiction, in fact uh, I just finished the the the latest George Saunders short story collection, liberation day, uh, it's all, it's got all the stuff you want from a George Sundersburg, it is amazing how how formally persist consistent he has been over his career, and like you can say, oh, you, that's kind of boring over a while, but I think what's so interesting about him is how he's able to create these templates and then fill them each time with something that hits new. and hits hits uh uh from an angle and and kind of makes things interesting like for example the first and longest story in the collection is called liberation day and it's very similar in structure to the old the simplice simplic the girls I believe diaries from the 11th of December which is the idea of uh like uh the using as a metaphor for like the relationship the class relationship between people in a consumer society, a hyperconsumer society like America, uh, and and using the metaphor of like science fiction, human instrumentality basically, like you know how you have people at your command and an app, well in a saunder story, that relationship is rendered uh uh visceral by getting rid of the uh the mediating element of the app or the phone and making it a direct, explicit. uh human domination, so like in the simplicity girls diaries, it's a ornament that people could get in their house, which is little orphan girls strung together on uh a like a laundry line uh and in liberation day it is a basically a home, it's a musical instrument essentially for home use, which is human beings who have been brainwashed at their own discretion because you know they signed the paperwork and the families needed the money or whatever. uh, the they have consented and under capitalism, and then strapped to their wall, a wall in a room in their house where they can like recite uh sort of uh lyric pros about different subjects, and then you can if you get enough of them up on a wall, you can interweave their discussions into like a sort of a word tapestry that people can come and watch, so again it's the same principle uh, but he takes that metaphor and he goes to deps with it. that have never been before for me and it's maybe it's it's I got to reread it but it's maybe my favorite of his uh freder oh this is very just quickly somebody says wasn't Fredericus to some degree he did take naked uh swims uh in uh the slavada what's the river in Prague this is a thing that scandalized the locals they really they actually uh the the winter king uh and their their court were actually kind of badly received in Prague. they were very happy at first the people to be liberated, but then they they they they sowered on them quickly, and one of the things that did it is that Frederick would swim in the river naked, the vitava, that's it, but another one was is that his his calvinist court followers and his court theologian, Abrahamtis uh believed that all of the ultraquist frippery of the cathedrals churches of Prague that the ultraquist, the Hussites took very were very proud of because it was symbolized their nationalist uh movement against German domination that they had that had seen them successfully rest and independent church that allowed them to take water uh to take wine and bread at communion uh they were very proud of it and these fucking calvinis came in and said yeah this is all got to go these these saints uh relics and and the stained glass they got to go. and the citizens were pissed, so anyway that's what I'm reading, he also has another one in there about uh a crazy uh uh a theme park of like you know since civil war banded the civil war landed bad decline there's always a story about a wacky theme park because America is when you think about it just a really wacky theme park and it's another good one it takes it it adds more wrinkles uh i not i don't think it's it's as successful as liberation day but uh it's still entertaining still keeps it fresh so god i love that guy i hope he writes another novel though uh link and the bardos but I'm also the other thing I'm reading right now fiction wise is I'm re-reading I'm reading for the first time the Hillary Mantel books uh which her death sort of inspired me too uh but also the fact you know I've been deep in the early modern period now and uh and it's uh drawing me closer to it and I want to kind of live there and she's really helping me do that these books are great about halfway through the second one bring up the bodies and uh they're phenomenal I read uh the place of greater safety before but I hadn't read any of these books and they're great, really loving them. Uh, somebody ask a good question back here and I want to find it. Oh, somebody said, what's the difference between Prussians and party Germans? You got to remember Prussia is not part, history, was not historially part of Germany, as we understand it, uh, it was not part of the holy Roman emperor, empire, for example. uh, it was part of that westward or eastern sort of uh liminal zone between the slaves and the eastern church and uh and uh latin christianity which on its eastern edges was German uh and so you had part of part the the the nut of the Prussian Empire or the Prussian the Pressian state that would come into being was the Dutchy of Brandenburg in the north central part of Germany. uh they were the the the uh Brandenberg was an electorate, it was a very important principality in Germany, but it didn't become Prussia until it was linked to the former lands of the teutonic Knights uh which was which were a group of crusaders uh who after being turfed out of the holy land uh turned their imperial gays towards the old slabs. of uh the northern northeastern Baltic who had not been converted to Christianity yet, and they did a holy, the teutonic Knights did a holy war that let saw them become the the the feudal dominators of this of a rest of a restive peasant population uh where uh just as serftom is sort of dying out in eastern or western Europe, it is being essentially reinstalled by the uh teutonic Knights onto this area, now that area gets chopped down by uh over time and eventually a lot of it becomes the lithu, the polish lithuanian commonwealth, but I think one thing is very interesting is that the teutonic, the uh the grand master of the teutonic Knights who is the M 'who is essentially the the monarch, the elected monarch of that chunk of uh of uh or that colony, that german colony in northeastern Europe, is the first prince of in the the first prince in Europe to convert to lutherranism, to convert his holdings to the lutheran church, and it's because his position was being undermined, his power was d' uh and he sought to bolster it by gaining uh that percentage of his authority and revenue that was bleeding out of there to the fucking church in Rome. so you see this the the prussian land ends up becoming brandenburg plus this rump of the old uh teutonic Knights holdings and that becomes prussia and then as Austria, declines, prussia rises, because there is a vacuum is created in the German world that must be filled, inevitably will be filled, but it's not going to be filled by those party Germans, I talked about, uh, the Bavarians, the the southern Catholics, because they are enjoying their catholic uh uh carnival lives, in the in the rich heartland of German uh agriculture. and in the in the busy cities of of Lutheran Europe or lutheran Germany rather, the northern parts, people are making money, the the the... that grind, whereas this rem, this this this feudilized, powerful, rural military elite, this aristocratic elite in prussia organizes into a military state, and fredrick the great becomes the the the sort of history bestriding, history on horseback figure who sort of gathers the energies within Prussia, the the drive towards the a vacuum created by the decline Austria uh and then creates this incredible military machine uh, but it declines quickly because it essentially extinguish, it has its chance, it makes its effort, but uh, it leaves it still relatively small in population and and uh relatively poor, relatively to the other powers of Europe, which are doing capitalism at this point. which it can't compete with, it cannot gain the land necessary to make up for its uh weakness relative to capitalist economies, and so that means that when the German state comes into being, uh, it is dominated politically by this militarized Aristocracy. and then that that militarized aristocracies directs Germany into the machine of war that it became uh which helped ensure that the uh struggle for resources in the crisis conditions of the late of the early 19th century would uh create a war, another war for Europe, uh, the 30 years war was a war for Germany, uh, and then 300 years later, 300 years of capitalist development, you get another crisis in similar conditions, uh, but this time, a unified Germany is now at war uh with the rest of the capitalist uh, the rest of um, the capitalist states of Europe, again. so it expand into the whole continent, and because these are uh now colonial powers that extends into the entire world, and would have destroyed capitalism, had it not been for the existence of the United States, there to absorb all the contradictions of European capitalism and uh and neutralize them, creating different contradictions that are going to explode in the long term, but in the short term, staving off, it's an We're recording the 30 years war episode, we're almost done writing the seventh, we have six in the can, basically we got to do some editing, but those are largely done, and and recorded, we're going to record this one hope, the seventh hopefully in Miami, we're going to hopefully have it out early in January. Why do you guys hate New England and never visit? We have played Providence, Boston, uh, New Haven. Portland Maine and uh Nashawa New Hampshire, so we've been in the New England, what's not the life about New England? It's uh, it's it's the most demon haunted part of the country because it's where the American psychy was forged, it's where the the the dread and horror of an untamed. natural world that has not been rationalized according to the the religious and cultural and economic structures that that made us feel more to reality, we were these settled and formed European minds, of course you say, no, no, there are natives here, they had a complex civilization, correct, but an undoing of their realities, and so then they had to reforge a reality out of blood, and the thing is is that they were doing that in Europe, they were forging realities out of blood, but it was each other's blood, which means that you're just setting yourself up for a reinscribement of traumas to... eventual annihilation, which is what would have happened and did happen, Europe was destroyed, what prevented it from that destruction from destroying the structures that had led to that fucking conflict was the existence of the United States, because the because those identities were forged as all identities are in blood, but that blood was not their blood, it was the blood of an other who could become the repository for all the sublimated, alienations and miseries, large and small psychic damages of existence in class society. uh, this is something that Calhoon, John C Caloon understood deeply, that's why Richard Halberstam called him the Marks of the master class, because he had a similar understanding of the inevitable, creeping, annihilating nature of class rule, he just he believed that the existence of a slave class, diffused intra white class conflict, which cannot be contained, and he was correct about that, that is why the the lid would had to be put back on the the Pandora's box after the end of the civil war, because the reality of equality was starting to kick in, and the thing is, it could have gone differently, the conditions existed uh for there to be different results of that, because again, as I was saying, identities are forged in blood, and the blood spilled from northern whites during the civil war was entirely spilled by southern whites. There is a world where that experience reorients to some degree a significant enough degree to move the needle politically and institutionally and move the the the gigantic uh ultra starship of uh earth society of of the the psychic spaceship we're all living in in one direction or another. but we didn't get that cuuse we got Lincoln's assassination, we get Johnson's disastrous ascension to the presidency, we get the rolling back of the nacent land reform that was marking reconstruction and could have marked it more uh, again not to create a a utopia, but to change the terrain of future conflict, move, move the the goal posts, change the conditions. so when a great war erupts in 1914, the American political system looks differently, maybe there still is horrible violence, there still is Indian extermination, there still is vast uh racial conflict and and and oppression, but it is being contain within a political uh structure that recognizes that struggle, instead of wipes it off the board, which is what white democracy after the end of reconstruction did. That means social struct, that means political structures that are more able to directly uh address capitalism during conditions of crisis uh, and of course that would kick in, that would create more resistance among capitalist, social and political institutions. That means conflict, open and uh and uh and undeclared war, but that's the history we got, that is the history of humanity. till now, we just find ourselves at an exhaustion point that might be, might have been others otherwise, and all right, i got to wrap up here, we're yeah, i got to start recording soon, democracy ending globally says, well yes of course uh, but again, that's not going to be a real change for... anybody's material conditions, i really don't think, we're only talking about the removal of emblems, we've got a machine in power that has like some cool, like decals on it to make it look like something else, to make it look like a transformer or something, to make it look like your friend and neighbor, the the the government that responds to you, then it's just going to fall off, now that's but it's going to be replaced by something else, it's going to be replaced by some political spectacle that the people who are... uh in some way or another perceive themselves to be wrapped in its bosom and not being killed by it, which is what's actually happening, being suffocated by it, which is what's actually happening, it's it feels like being to some degree cukoon. even if you feel aware of that and guilty about it, you still feel deeper than uh political ideology, you still feel uh dependent on it, that's the word uh, and so there'll still be some sort of democratic terrain, and only historialy are you going to be able to look back and say, oh, that's not, that's when the democracy isn't there anymore, because it's it's a slow cooking, it is not some sort of... what we want it to be, which is a a apocalyptic rev revealing of what is real of what is. the apocalypse is the unveiling, right? that's what that means, the uncovering of something, and that is the the machine behind the mask of democracy, but i don't think we're going to get that, because building the mask is what the machine does, like generating the mask, like is is the whole reason that the thing exists, to tell itself a... so it cannot go away, only with if the machine breaks down, and the machine will break down as it's breaking down now, margins, not at the center, okay, all right, talking to you guys next week, bye-bye.
