 the festival was over and the boys were off and the cavalry was quiet except for the drinning wall. okay, if you had been lifted and the game shut down anyone with any sense at already enough time you standing in the corner looking like the jack of hards, back there guys. five calls of my stairs, they had two queens, she was hoping for it, outside the streets are filling out the windows of breeze was blowing, they called another bed and drop the jack of ours, ah am i on? I'm on, all right, great, I'm on, fantastic, this is rare, usually it's lately it's been kind of annoying, uh, everybody, yeah, uh, so I was at a uh antique store the other day and I found this little blacker box uh, that I didn't really recognize, I got a decent deal with for it, went online, found out more, and apparently there's some sort of uh, puzzle that you saw with it, and if you make it into a certain shape uh, well you uh you see sightes that uh you would not otherwise see I guess uh so today I thought on stream you and I were going to solve it together let's go now of course that's joke for anyone who uh enjoyed hell razer uh and that's also of course a puckkish reference to the gentlemen who tried to solve the tried to take the elsats uh on twitch. why? i don't care anything about who he is or anything about it, i don't know or care, just the act of doing that to me, as someone who streams on twitch semi professionally, mind blowing, absolutely mind blowing, the confidence, i mean it's the perfect double edge sword, because at the one end this is a confidence that really you know could build an empire, but at the same time a idiocy. that undergirds the uh confidence that guaranteees that any effort other than you know getting people to watch your dick around on the computer is going to come for nothing but wow i can't imagine doing something like that just the thought of live having thousands of people see you just like know not know what you're talking about fail miserably god it's terrifying i mean i will not lie when i say that that is the thing that sort of drives me like the the the uh the closest thing i have to a a a neurotic association i guess with uh with the streaming is just you know not falling off the beam in terms of intelligibility in such a way that i lose people because you know if if if it's not making sense to anybody else then maybe it's not i mean maybe it doesn't make sense you know in a greater sense i can't have that so the idea of somebody just going yeah i'll i'll take this uh thing i'll take this law test it's logic i'm good at logic amazing amazing damn near uh, it's it's damn beyond everything at time, and uh, it really, that tells me a lot about the type of people that advance in the internet uh takeespear, the internet personality sphere is, you essentially have to have a part of your brain missing that recognizing your that recognizes your own intellectual uh uh and limitations. and it poses a challenge, anybody who wants to think on the internet or even express themselves on the internet is, how are you going to keep yourself grounded? uh, by the way guys and gals, uh, it came for the republic which it stands, the first book and - my uh planned reading festival to prepare for doing something uh with the concept. of an unassassinated Lincoln, I'm going to start reading this, and I thought it would be fun just like as a project for myself and for anybody wants to follow on, to do a little mini book club where I'll just kind of talk about what what I read that week, so next Wednesday uh, and I'll put this on Twitter and stuff, I'll probably read the first three three chapters of this and talk about them, not very long probably, I'm not going to do like the whole show, uh, but you know, I'll just probably do like a 10-minute thing at some point. I did, I bought the book, I bought it, what if your 6x foot tall and smoky, oh right, the... book is the republic for which it stands by Richard White. I first heard about Richard White honestly uh, at least this book, I mean he's written some other good ones. I first read this book, first heard of this book when he was interviewed on Patrick Wayman's podcast, tides of history, which is very good, and uh, I, I trust Patrick a lot, he sounded really good in the interview, so we're going to start there, it's a very solid book. literally i could probably kill someone with it. oh is Chris in the chat? cool, i love it when chris is in the chat. especially since he can he can address some of your audio concerns if you have them. at least the ones about translating like uh files and shit. and yes he is a train guy. he wrote another book called railroaded about the transcontinental railroad. which and the and the whole like creation of railroad uh which of course you know is the perfect subject if you're trying to understand the capital formation in the in the years after the civil war because as i said uh the civil war was the catalyst for of capital creation capital concentration rather uh in America that created sort of the dynamo that led us to an industrial capitalism. on a grand scale, on a competitive worldwide scale, and in the aftermath of the war, the thing that took the place of waging war uh was building uh, building a rail infrastructure, and the way we did it was we just gave a shit ton of land to a bunch of private companies and had them uh speculate their asses off across the continent uh while just grinding men into hamburger uh while building it. so if you're talking about any kind of you know what would have what would, what if history of America where we don't get civil, we don't get our failed reconstruction and our robber-baron captured by of our governmenting governing institutions, one big things that would be different would be the way that we build the fucking rail rods, i mean honestly up to including the question of how how how you now how intense our exploitation of uh of native lands with being anyway, getting ahead of myself, uh, didn't talk, didn't Lincoln talk about wage slaves and stuff, well yeah, I did, I mean that was a common abolitionist argument and was one of the things that appealed to working class and uh small holding northerners was uh the idea that if you uh allowed them to that there is a an essential uh you know coersion at the heart of wage labor and slavery uh and that you know if if the south wins they will impose a greater degree of coersion now the south would rejon by saying well actually wage slavery is inferior uh to slavery, there was a southerner named uh Fitsu who wrote a number of books uh where he made the argument that if you you're going to always have two classes of people, the smarter and the less smart, the smarter ones tell the dumber ones what to do, and therefore they will be in a subordinate position. now what should that be? the slave model has a reciprocal relationship built into it, it says i you owe me your labor, but i also... I also provide you with basic uh um uh basic survival uh uh foder like I feed you, I give you a place to sleep, I give you a stable way to reproduce yourself, even if everything else is up for grabs and up at my discretion, whereas wage slavery, you're saying, yeah, you guys are going to work for me, if you don't you'll starve, and if you do, I will give you this money for you to go find your own food and shelter, well fuck, these these are the dumb people, remember, these are the idiots, they're not going to be able to do that, they're going to fuck it up, they're going to start starving, so what, and their lives will be over time worse, their poverty will be greater, their misery will be greater than the slaves will be, and other southerners hated when Fitsu talked about this, and his books were not that popular among advocates of slavery who were trying to you, keep the north acquiescing to the existence of slavery, because they did, if if too many northerners heard that that's what the south thought, they would make the conclusion, oh, well then eventually they're going to turn us into slaves and they were right to think that. Fitz Hue was the... guy who is taking all of the conceptions that undergird slave society to their logical conclusions, not separating, not stopping at the arbitrary border of something like race, which the smarter even then knew wasn't a real thing, or not as real as like the the the people who are trying to convince themselves that like you were talking about different species, uh, even though different species can't reproduce, at least not reproduce uh fertile offspring, so right there you have lost any even a scientific basis as they understood science. at the time, but that didn't stop from trying, because they wanted to create an arbitrary border of exploitation. well, no, no, not white people, if it's you saw farther and said, no, white people too, why not? are they dumb? they can't, they're not in charge, they've never been in charge, they've always taken orders. why is that going to change? why have them running under foot and creating problems and making everything miserable for themselves and everyone? when they could be be put into a submission, a mutually advantageous submission, where they recognize their inferiority. and of course the thing about fitsu's logic, which is the logic, the undergirting logic, the social logic of every mechanism of of class exploitation we've had since the dawn of civilization and the one undergird and capitalism, and the one that will over time take over and become the soul relationship of... production is that notion of there are those who take and there are those who give in some combination du through some combination of a willingness to give, which is their participation in a social order that they have invested psychologically in the maintenance of, some culture, or this is this is when we describe this we're describing superstructure, culture as such, and then there is bare uh um physical force, undergards the uh whatever the person in the has in their head as they're giving to the person who takes. now what, and that is the dialect, that dialectic relationship is the driver of class struggle between those two types of person, broadly construed. now as the society gets more complicated, the relationship gets blurry, and you have things like slaves and serfs and fucking uh adventured servants. and levies and and freeholders and and uh wage workers and managers and CEOs and and and and civil servants and professionals where all these things get inmeshed in one another and they get muddy, but over time, over time as capital accumulates at one end of this poll, and capital and resources run out, the divide reemerges and asserts itself, like i've talked a few times before about how uh the the guys who own 7-eleven franchises have essentially been proletarianized by 7-eleven uh because they're able to uh because they run the whole they're vulnerable because they - they need 7-eleven to provide them with you a franchise license and all the materials that they sell and they can change that relationship basically uh at will and and so a lot of these guys are making essentially minimum wage and working 80 hours a week while they're essentially owning this thing that's because because and that process happens throughout every strata, and some people are able to negotiate a trans phase transition, like some small some like medium size manufacturer or small business person who is about to get crush is able to like b uh buy stock somewhere or get a job within the structure, one way or another they're being alienated from their capital, everyone is going to be alienated from their capital or have capital accumulate to them in classes, and those classes now according to the... ideology of the state and all that or the and the ideology that undergirds these systems like the one fitsy was expressing, that comes down to intelligence, that that comes down to some person or or like breeding, whatever the hell you want to call it, superiority of culture, all it boils down to a better brain, you have a better brain, so it's okay, it's it's only natural that you should get this, of course, that's absurd for a zillion reasons, but one of the most prominent prominent ones is that... even if you take the assumption for granted, the superiority that they are of talking about is a very narrow set uh of um skills that all revolve around the process of extracting fucking surplus and hoarding it, which as a system breaks down as uh resources run out or as you, externalities within the biological system build up, the system is in. capable of correcting because it is um selected in the form of reproducing the privilege of people who are already on top and who therefore give these special brains to their kids just by the version. of giving them a social context to be acculterated into that both social and intellectual uh and it's going to eventually crash into the godd i mean it's it's 9-11 every day anyway but eventually it won't even be sustainable on its own terms and that's when you get the common ruin of the contending classes and both of them fucking smash into each other uh the alternative to that is a structure where the boundaries this boundary of extractor and and and extract e is abolished, and everybody is working and everybody else is enjoying surplus, everybody is preating surplus, everybody is enjoying it to the degree that they can, because it is a there is a social recognition of the existence of a social organism, that is the basis of marxist for each according. his ability to each according to his needs, which so many libertarians are horrified by because they imagine, well what if you did that now? it would be like they acclaim the tyranny of the lazy and the stupid, they just sit back because why wouldn't they? they're free riders, but all that logic, the free rider logic of libertarianism rests on the idea that there is a fundamental alienated humanity making up this system, from each according to his abilities to each according to describes in the broadest sense the social reality, the flow of capital, or whatever, the flow of surplus, rather, the flow of surplus throughout the the social system is from ability to need, and everybody needs, so everybody's needs are met, everybody has ability of some kind or another, and it is the socialization of the process and the use of the technology that has accumulated through the process of capital accumulation of capitalism, that is then applied. the world around us to allow for that that organic flow of surplus within a social system to be um generate, so that is why uh there can never be any uh, in my mind quarter uh to be given to uh any desserts-based mor order, which all capitalist apologium must be at the end, even even in your even liberals, even honestly a certain brand strands of market socialists, it's it's an idea that there must be a a there must be a system of reward for ability, and ability broadly construed as brain power, but in a socialist system, the reward is is living in a socialist society, and that is why you know like like i said, oh free riders, what about lazy people who don't want to contribute, why would they why? Why would you want to? I mean, the number of slave owners complained about how how uh, including George Washington, the founder of this country who is on, written letters, who wrote letters complaining, you know, the thing about these blacks is that they really won't work unless you're forcing them to, what the fuck is wrong with, with this incredulity and and horror, like we're giving you food and shelter, and it's like... well yeah, but if you were getting food and shelter too, right, and you were working in some way towards our common survival too, we were all together, then they probably wouldn't uh resist working, but they also wouldn't be having to do what you're making them do, and of course this is all, you know, this, this is, this is the reason, talking about this stuff is the reason that marks didn't like trying to sketch out. of what socialism would look like, because it necessitates, it requires like like actual, the end state that people or not even, I don't mean the end state, but I mean the the the post transition state that people imagine in their heads, it is, and and therefore the the broader goals and the broader projects that we have to express and live and try to move towards now in the here and around and here now in this moment necessitate and essentially a collective ph. and and that's not like that's not hippy bullshit, we've already had phase shifts in human consciousness, the creation of the modern liberal subject is a phase shift. that happened, like if you've gotten a bunch of uh medieval motherfuckers sit around in the castle and in reams or something and say hey what's what like imagine this system collapses and what comes next or or no not even collapses like feutilism, you know what, this thing's bad, why don't we get a new one? they they wouldn't do it, and they never were able to do it, because you need to have a liberal subject for that kind of social uh relationship to even ex to generate that kind of uh discourse, but imagining it could, just assuming it could, they wouldn't have been able to get anywhere near where we are, because it would have required them to imagine people acting towards each other in a fundamentally alien way, it would have required them imagining people acting towards each other as strangers, which they could not do, now of course there are strangers in the medieval world, the sarasin and and the headens or whatever, but within christendom. "and certainly within like the the community, the idea that that you could walk out your door and everybody you saw in a day were people who you did not know, and I don't mean know just in sense of recognize, I mean the sense of have an actual social embedded relationship with, they couldn't have imagined that, they couldn't imagine living like that, and it's like, well we live that way because we because the very order we live in, has generated a a a shifted conception of the self and relationship to others than the in the medieval subject had and post-transition socialism would require a similarly um shifted perception of others a a resocialized conception of the cell where you have regained the social embeddedness of pre-capitalist society, but within a cosmopolitan framework. where it doesn't have to be somebody who you've dug turnipped next to your whole life, or somebody who goes to the same cathedral that spent 300 years being built or that fights in the same crusade everybody, maybe not as deeply as you know as deeply, but as as um influential towards one's like ideas of loneliness and and fulfillment and existential uh um satisfaction similar. but that face shift only comes with uh with a change with a revolution of what type, i have no idea, i wish i could tell you, and i believe someone says i feel like this is a thing that anarchist miss and abs, that's absolutely, the anarchist assumes an inviable liberal subjectivity that will persist into their... anarchist, their an anarchist society that they are imagining moving towards, that will only reproduce liberalism can only produce capitalism, because in the absence of social bonds, we are all out for ourselves, we are all homo-economicas, we are all going to seek to benefit from the surplus of labor that we did not participate in, because we do not feel the injustice of that, because it's not happening to us. and now someone might say, well there are anarchists to do take this into consideration, and it's like, maybe, but my observation of anarchis and practice and as a tradition suggests the otherwise, I saw Mank, I watched Mank, most of all, I just don't know why it was, I, I mean, I know why it was made, it was a screenplay that David Fincher's dad wrote 40 years ago, and he's been trying to make ever since, and which 100% only exists. because Netflix is at the point where they're going to give money to any big name director who has anything that they want to make, that's why they gave scoresy $500 million dollars to do the three hour three and a half hour old age home digital uh deaging movie, which I think is brilliant as a brectian like masterpiece of alienation, but for very for that very reason it never would have been financed by a regular studio at that fucking rate, it might have, but it would have had to have been one of those deals where like scores. goes in basically lying to them and then they just give them him more money over time until their pot committed, which is essentially i think what happened with the fucking zider snider cut, which w warner brothers thought, oh great, we'll just we'll get a few more uh eyeballs off out of these pigs by just taking our old crap and putting the new label on it, but it turns out it needed work and once Snider got in there, he started asking for stuff, before they knew it they'd thrown another like $100 million dollars onto the fucking fire and now that thing has cost like $500 million dollars, that's because but um he he basically tricked them and scores says he would have had to trick people into letting him make the Irishman in a regular studio and I don't think any studio signing off on this self-conscious like black and white fake 40s movie about this making of citizen kane uh and he's only making it buse his dad the screenplay my puchino half impression your fucking father fucking ensure the fucking local not very good i am very excited for the snider cut and i will watch it for sure uh and yeah i'm fine with them doing that but sometimes you wonder if they should have stayed in the holster. i just there's something deeply indulgent about it, like David Fincher's dab and thanks for reminding us by the way that at this point all these people even the good directors, even the good directors are just rich kids, everybody is just somebody's kid who decided to take a flyer on a career in the arts, everybody in in Hollywood at this point is like Marie Antoinette blouncing about in her fake peasant village at Versai, so thank you for reminding me of that uh and and and even if it's like oh he wasn't rich it's like okay his dad had a fucking screenplay for 40 years he was clearly in the business and that's more than most people um and also it's just like i remember people saying it's about it's about mankowits fight for uh recognition first of all no it isn't he has one scene where he argues with orson wells about whether he should get credit at the end of it she says fine i'll give you credit he gets the oscar what's the grievance what is the grievance that drove this and apparently it's a po'. kale essay, it just all feels very crankish, although i will say the stuff about uh, you know epic in the 34 sanclair campaign was interesting, but i think there's a bunch of more interesting ways it could have been presented, i do think it was funny that uh, bill nigh played uh up inclair, that's actually pretty, that's pretty, that's pretty good, so so you know it was all right, i'd say i'm gna, i haven't done it on letter box yet, i'll probably give it three and a half, three and a half is my courtesy number where it's like i recognize the craft, i'm not gonna poo poo it, i see some things i enjoyed, i liked i very much enjoyed charles dances william randolf hurst he sort of had the hollow like slack look that he had, it was pretty eary uh and and uh oldman was really good so there's and like i liked all the uptons and clar parts but so trying to have, i have to rewatch video drome, someone's asking about video drome, i haven't. seen it in a long time, i do remember enjoying it, i like cronenberg of course, and james woods is actually one of my favorite actors and it certainly seems prophetic, we're we're we're living in some new flesh, that's for sure, we are living the hell out of some new flesh. uh if you like your flush uh you can keep it uh let me becare i love that b that obama is doing his media tour now it's fantastic he's he's i love it most of all because he is confirming everything uh we've been saying about it. uh and specifically the shit about how he does not view himself as a figure who wielded power, he never imagined himself to have been in the same room as power, his job was to experience power on behalf of a grateful nation that he could then explain power to. he could go to the mountain top and like look at the bush and he like a kind of a moses type figure. where where where the burning bush is just the grinding gears of capitalism. barpsack okrumbo. i've been thinking about his. about my one of my, i mean barsachombo is my favorite name for him, but one another name i really like is the obungler and the thing about the old bungler is that. I don't know if it's accurate because I really don't know if you can say that he bungled at it, because if you really got him strapped to a chair and like hit him with sodium pentathol, how much would he really want to have gone differently at the expense of doing different things, like that's the thing, it can't just be, oh, it would have been nice if Mitch McConnell had been more uh respectful or whatever. no, what would you have been willing to do in exchange for what different outcome? what can you look back on and say oh that was a mistake? i honestly don't think he would have any because i think that he is so deeply narcissistic and so fully conv, so efused to his conception of himself, not just as like an empathic person, but also as an intellect, as someone who has looked into the fiery furnaces of capitalism and has been seered by them. to the level of like deep knowledge of the universal truths and as such, i think his commitment to himself as passive and to all decisions made within the halls of power as predetermined and out of his hands. i think he very well might look back and go, yeah, i didn't bungle anything, and if he doesn't think he bungled anything, i don't know if you you could be said that he bungled anything. because if he wasn't working on behalf of some broadly construed American public, he wasn't trying to do anything for anybody but himself, he wasn't trying to do anything except get himself a netflix deal and get himself a fucking uh $500 million dollars to write 3,00 page book that every fucking tedious uh uh person with a a home cappuccino machine is going to read and and give to each other for christmas, he might think he bungled, he might have bungled, but if that's not what he was working for. that's not what his goal was, then he succeeded on his own terms, so kudos, sir, now you might say the one thing he might have bungled, i see someone pointed it out in the chat and yes, that's a good one, is keeping biden out of the box on behalf of Hillary in 2016, although once again, i think if he sat down, he would say some bullshit to himself, like well uh hillary uh at that point uh she had a robust enough team and she he had she had uh people in the DLC DNC who were going to support her and uh if Biden had uh stepped in it would have split the establishment and uh Berney would have gotten the nomination and lost Trump uh even worse or not lost of Trump which to them also a disastrous outcome so he's probably got something in his own fucking pot in his in his head to tell him that that was not a bungle. That's one of the beauties of being that kind of guy is that that Olympian remove and that and that and that isolation of intellect into this crackpot realist framework where uh I have completely accepted the structure even though I'm one of the most powerful people within any global order you know to to provide direction for the for for the direction for this thing oh he might uh "you know what, no, never mind, there's one thing, no, I was thinking, did he would he have said he wished he wouldn't have said anything about uh, about skip gates, cop being stupid, he probably would said yeah, that was stupid, but then again he's probably very proud of the beer summit, he did write about it in the book, I mean, he really didn't have to mention the beer summit more than like a page, I don't know, but or honestly like a line, and he talked about it significantly, so maybe he'd be like, uh, gave us an opportunity to uh, bring some serious questions to uh, the public." I think he would definitely prob, he would definitely say he shouldn't have said anything about like uh Kanye when he called him a jack ass, they probably like oh that was beneath me, or that he shouldn't have worn a tan suit that one time, uh, yeah, yeah, it feels like there's like an intellectual battle, even about like not whether or not Barack Obama sucks, but how is the nature of his suckiness. nature of his badness, and I think he has to be viewed not as misguided, not as even treacheus really, uh, so much as blank, so much as a empty vessel, uh, one of those high galilean figures who emerges to embody the time, to embody the emptiness of the time, to e the emptiness of life in 20 late 20th century and 21st century America uh a life where all values are reduced to values where the self is posed composed entirely of just a sluiss of base desires self-generated by a machinery of of uh of misery and oppression trying to soit its own wounds, and that the only measure of a person can be their. success within that system at expressing themselves. if we are all alone, we are all to die and be forgotten, then the only thing we can do is try to be remembered, and so the most ambitious of us, the smartest of us will endeavor to be remembered to be able to build fucking monuments to themselves. to acquire fame and more importantly money to consecrate their image and blason it across space and time and into that breach people are going to step who have that combination of ability and will, essentially the ability to at a basic level delude themselves into a similar. the ethics of this degraded inhuman moment onto their very species being and so they are able to move motivate themselves the way that i have said like uh revolutionaries have to motivate themselves from within like that John brown drive that connection tissue between himself and every other person that meant that he felt the pain of others to such an extent that he was driven and focused. towards the goal of ending that oppression because he felt it. The figures who rise in the current moment like Obama are ones who have been able to psychologically separate themselves so completely from every other person in the world that they can self-motivate in one direction as opposed to the rest of us Porschemucks who can only ever se somew separate that connection and that means that our pursuits of success within the system are undermined at every point. we are either too distracted by carnality or our connection to other people leave us paralyzed, how can how can i get a job at this company knowing what they do? how can i do x, y and z job, knowing what it does, how can i do x, y or z menial job, knowing how how how much? it uh leaves me miserable, instead uh, the fully uh possessed, I guess, the fully possessed figure like an Obama and Trump, are able to to unify themselves and put all of their energy into a spiritual pursuit of narcissism, which aludes most people, but the more successful of us, at least the ones who have to work in some way for their own success, and can't just sit on piles of money, the ones who will have to do something and Obama, I would say certainly uh more than Trump, although honestly Trump too, because if Trump had just wanted to be rich, he could have just sat on money forever, it was he wanted to be famous and being a mid-tier developer in New York in the 70s is not a great way to get famous, you have to work at it, and he did, Obama, farther from power and power from the public eye had to work even harder, well Obama is smarter than Trump'. but they're both driven by the same dynamo of of of religious narcissism, of of of self-worship, which is what we're all supposed to be being driven towards, and the thing about that is that, we are a monotheistic world, there could be only one, and that's why monopolization and accumulation are the drive of capitalism and will eventually consume all humanity, unless that that spell is broken, unless that's that engine driving us in that direction is broken, so Obama set to the point of becoming a world historical figure for a young age, and he was very, very good at it, he's he is very smart, but that's because he's worshipping his own self, fully, he is, he is an a mystic basically. as is Trump, and that is why they embody the the the emergent um, that's why they embody now the... the the um social dialectic between democrats and republicans, the two Americas who are now at at at war with one another that were bord out of the the collapse of 2008 and the subsequent bipartisan non-recovery that said, okay, the economy just liquified, instead of having building back together, we're just going to leave it as this big pool of money that we're just going to dump into it and let the richest here get more of it and and pour money down their bucket and then allow them to use their market share and then relative uh um parganing position visa v a further emiserated working class to fully poperize people into techno surfs which is the whole app economy which is basically the entirety of job growth since 2008 that was a bipartisan uh uh uh job and they carried that shit out to the team and out of that out of this hypercharged individualized spectaclized society uh to embody one uh way of getting ahead within that system, one way of successfully worshipping god, one way of becoming the god that you know you need to be is Obama's and Obama's is, follow the rules, that's basically the argument, here are the rules as set up, and now those rules are liberal, right, because of the need to have a uh, a system of um, what amounts to eticat to allow the market to function, like the market needs. eticat because everybody's a stranger and and and everybody uh has to have is approaching each other from a position of alienation and so the same way you have to shake hands tip your cap to stranger you have to embody certain values and those values are inculcated in college and you learn them and then you apply them to the world and Obama showed you, if that is what you're captured by, if that vision of self-worship is what you're powered by, that shows you the way, trump is break the rules, trump is if you want to become god, if you want to become the most famous person on earth, therefore a god for all of time after that, uh, you just be a fucking asshole until there's nothing anyone else can look at but you, and there's nothing anyone else can hear but your voice, now the thing about that is that that's a tough one if you don't already have a lot of money or social position or attention to begin with, and that is why that one is not as appealing to people who are less demographically positioned that way, and it is appealing to that cough here of like baby boomer uh white people who are sitting on all the remaining wealth really we have domestically in this country, and see that and it's certainly especially after seeing eight years of this one version that they can't do. they're too old man, they're too setting their ways, they can't curtely like that, they can't extend their pinky fingers, they can't remember not to say that about those people, trump says fuck that, and then those get to be the two visions of of godhood that we all battle around. and the that working-class movement towards Trump, or at least a Trump influenced republican party, because there's no way whoever they nominate now, I have no idea what's coming after Trump, it's hard to imagine him not wanting to run for re-election, spend the next four years just doing what he's been doing because he likes the running around the country part and he could still do that for the next four years and then just run again, I think he honestly at this point might do it, because it'll be all this parts he does enjoy, which is campaigning with nothing else, and then because he has a dog brain and doesn't remember anything and has on no object permanence, he'll forgot how much he hated actually being president, and he'll drive himself back, but one way or another, even if he drops dead of covid tomorrow, which would be hilarious, of course, the the party is now the alternative to this follow the rules, obama party, and uh, a lot of those working class people of... they're not going to find themselves anymore able to imagine themselves succeeding by following the rules as uh any of the beautiful boters who support Trump? but of course in reality nobody gets to be got, nobody gets to do it, nobody gets to be fully actualized. sacistic beings instead what they get is the chance to see that desire just dissolve before their eyes and be replaced with nothing. with no social balm, no no soit, no, no, no sucker to come in the form of love of others, just further emiseration and and precarity more than anything, the sense of always not going up, but falling down, and because the conditions of that precarity are not negotiable, they're not. but nobody is, nobody uh in power is signing off on uh, any redistribution of power or money away from the current polles that it's being pulled towards, sorry, all you can do is find that other tribe with that other god and kill it, because it's the reason that the crops won't grow. We do not need am prim, and prim is not the answer, and prim turns back into capitalism, because I mean if you're because if you don't have that social conception I was talking about, thing where your sense of self-identity is composed psychologically of a... genuine felt relationship to other people beyond yourself and specifically beyond even the people you know personally and people that you even outside of it like a cultural context with, without that tribal breakdown, primitive breakdown will result again in a conflict over resources and conflict over resources is the driver of social alienation. and you can't say, well, we'll all get to that point and then just break back up, you'll lose it over time, it has to be sustained technologically, that social connection has to be maintained technologically, drainage, drain dry, so sorry, i drink your mouth. Our face shifts ultimately spiritual, indeed, a spiritual revolution, but as I've said before, that's not crazy that's not made up, it's happened before, uh, the Europe going from uh, Europe going from Pagan to Christian, that's a spiritual revolution, the uh medieval uh embedded in corporate sense of self being turned into liberal uh individualism, that is a spiritual revolution, it's the it's it's it's the necessary byproduct of a change in material relationships. you have a situation where material relationships are moving in one direction, and as the ferment within them and the conflict within them moves them in another, if you if you get to that socialism, barbarism and flection points say within our system that is you know moving towards uh crisis. crisis one time, maybe not now, maybe not in 100 years, but it it is, uh, if it breaks towards um, if it breaks towards socialism, that will mean a change of material relationship that will over time change people's sense of self, because of it, because of the change to their uh social relations to one another, I mean sorry, their material relations to one another. and once enough people have had there and enough like gent enough kids have been born into new social relationships that generate new spiritual concepts. if enough people have those experiences, if enough people have those mysterious due to their material conditions having changed and the the change keeps moving in the same direction, just like what happened with the emergence of the liberal identity, eventually you get a situation an inflection point of consciousness where. people are experiencing the life, experiencing life in a different spiritual context, but it comes after changing matural conditions, because if we're going to make socialism, it'll be because a bunch of people who are alienated, who do not live that life, who do not have a spiritualized sense, who are living every day as like a raw nub. working together enough to push things in a direction, but they're still going to be separated, but it will be through the act of working together and seeing. uh results from the work that that uh those spiritual changes happen on an individual basis, some people have like large scale like conversion experiences, other people have, just a change, a gradual change in their their their emotional palette as it relates to other people, and then the relationship between people motivated by that changing spiritual sense and their application of them. to the wheel of material history, those things reinforce each other till you get another punctuated, a punctuation, an inflection of spiritual change. somebody says, medicare for all comes to the America, how? i have no fucking idea, i have precisely zero i. the political force that moves us even in that direction is one that is, if it exists now, it is in a uh absolutely pro state and it is as absurd for me to imagine how we get to medicare for all as it was for marx to sketch out what socialism would look like after the revolutions of 1848 not even to say that it's that necessarily far away in time but that it is that far away in event in incident in increasingly unpredictable random emergence of response to came in conditions, i mean hell, we might never get medical for all, we might go straight to uh, just national health healthcare, like doctors are employees of the state, which honestly is the superior system in the more socialist system, but i understand why it's not what people push for and it shouldn't be at the political level right now, but we very well might get there considering how how things, how how the confrontation with capital, what shape it takes and i don't know what shape it's going to take, i have suspicions, i have guesses, i think it's probably not going to come from the democrats, it's probably going to come from a diff a third party that emerges and sort of breaks up the doopoly and replaces one of the two parties uh, as happened in the 1850s, but beyond that i don't know, biden's covid plan is awesome. It's wonderful, it's definitely going to work, is the thing I love most about it, no money for anybody, keep everything open, make wear masks, which people are already doing by the way, basically what is the, I mean, he's not even saying they want to do a mandate, he's just saying, I'm going to ask everybody to do it, which they've already done, everyone every day tells you to wear the goddamn mask, and most people do wear the mask even the fucking republicans because it's like required indoors and people just sort of like, okay, fine, I'll do it. even republicans mostly do it, like only the most hardcore ones see it as a culture warshable at the demand and refuse to fucking wear a mask, so unless you're talking about requiring it, which would get create almost overnight a bunch of pussy comentatus revolutions of like hicks in uh hick sheriff department saying that they're not going to enforce it, and then what are you going to do, you're going to go to war, no, you're just going to back down so nothing accomplished and then the other one 100 million shots in 100 days, well there's 325 million people, so good job, one, two, yes, yeah, right, I'm sorry, I believe it when I see it for a million ways, even if everybody in America was dying to get the fucking thing and had no qualms about it whatsoever, the idea that we have the capacity to administer something like that on that scale and that time frame to me looks absurd. but the only way you can understand the democrats position right now is how can we get back to normal before we have to give people more money because they do know that it's some and the republicans honestly no to at some point they are going to have to give people more money not necessarily uh uh like the $1200 again but there's going to have to be a stabilizing injection of capital at the demands hoping the same way at the beginning of the thing, everybody was essentially saying, no, we're not going to shut down, because maybe it solves itself, maybe it falls away, maybe the transmission doesn't jump and maybe they track and trace the guy and it gets contained, maybe they drop the moab on ceder creek and uh it doesn't spread and we don't have to worry about it, the same way they were doing that for a while, that's one of the big reasons that everything went to hell so quick, right now they're like, how far like just? get some vaccines and people, maybe we can just get this thing kickstarted without having to give people more money, and so right now I think Biden and the whole both parties are in that wait and see thing, that suspended animation of like negotiating, not negotiating, giving the illusion of forward momentum just to buy time for a miracle in the form of a flawless carried out and executed uh vaccination campaign that reaches her immunity within 40 days or whatever the fuck. my guess is that they will uh they will they will give in before that, but i i honestly have no faith that they won't push it way too far, trying to wait it out. I did see a tweet today that said and I thought it was actually pretty brilliant uh I got to give credit, actually I should give credit because it's a really good idea is that uh the only way to deal with... fact that we have these two incommensur world views with the democrats and republicans uh and the way that there's so little trust between between these two factions, the only way you could guarantee a very quick uh uh ascension to a vaccine protocol is if you took the two vaccines because there's two, there's a moderna one and a Fizer one and had branded culturally one of them as the democrat vaccine and then branded another one culturally as the republican vaccine and had the two media apparatuses talk about that. um, not just in terms of saying ours is good, but more importantly saying that the other one was terrible, and the other one was going to make you either like, one, the democrats can say, oh, it's going to make you racist, or and democrats can say, oh, it's going to make you trans, and that you and that and more importantly, that getting the the one that the other ones don't like, uh, it owns them, and makes them unhappy, and and it would be. generating like anything from outside it wouldn't work, it has to contain both, but uh, it's it's too way too smart, zero chance we do it, we are far too dumb, all right, I'm going to get off in a second, but I want to, I want to credit this guy because I really thought that was a smart - smart idea, and would require more more cooperation than uh, and and coherence than our government is capable of. of undertaking, because the lumpin uh idiocy that has overcome our billionaire class as predictably also totally taken over our our political class so that not only like can capital not, not only is government not able to like coordinate capital uh because capital has so much influence now that it it just overawws uh the state's managerial uh and coordinated capacities, the people who could fight that with in government are similarly captured by self-interest. i mean, my god, mancy pelosi just admitted, yes, the other day that they fucking refused a massive amount of money, trillions of dollars and and another round of fucking checks to people uh, before the election because they didn't want trump Trump to win. that is what they call a perverse incentive. Uh, John Asconis, thank you. Shout out to John Casconos, that was very, very smart. I'm going to read it, I'm just going to read this thread cuz it's really good, the solution to vaccination under hyperpartisonship. is so obvious and cynical that it will never be done. we have two very similar vaccines, fizer moderna if you want to reach her immunity fast, you make one the lid vaccine and one the vag vaccine. give the new give the get the new biden administration to endorse the modernal vaccine as the best one for science and experts, have gates and Soros team up to send out the distribution, have gal gado lead a celebrity music video, haveing all of the soy people every one of the avengers getting the fucking moderna vaccine, you spread rumors that trump is... holding millions of fizer stock and mush rushed it through FDA approval, you get guy from Newsom to ban fizer in California, uh, have like um, yeah, have a bunch of like viral tweets about like fizer was a nazi company or something, uh, and then you have Trump go on Hannity and take uh, and they and they take the visors vax, they take it together and then you have the boots at the rallys and everyone would just do it. and uh and I just want to read these last ones because this was a very stute point uh this sounds crazy but considered that this is exactly what happened with the coronavirus pandemic itself from February on with both sides arms racing to maximally oppose whatever the other side happen to support. That's how you go from some tentative scientific support for hydrochloriqueine and a bit of trump boosterism to MSNBC and the New York Times writing hit pieces on it and talk show host joking about it while Fox News practically begins selling it on the web. website and the admin making it a miracle cure, that's the big part of it, the way that it reinforces each other, i remember the hydrochloriquin story, it was like, i mean the liberals were always saying, well we have to say this because people are dying, nobody's dying one idiot drink like a a goldfish cleaner or something, there is no need for everybody to go all in on horrible hydrochloric wins, they were driven that way by their need to define themselves in opposition. to Trump and the filtered down all the way to everybody, including on the left, which is supposed to be critical of this sort of high mine, and on the and then at the same time hydrochlor became the miracle cure on the right, and in not taking it was cuck, and yeah, like, that's that's that's the thing you put in your body, why wouldn't that work with a vaccine? all right, so I'm going to leave you guys and galls with a quote, a tweet that um, i retweeted today that really reminded me that the ideal, and I don't know, I'm not really joking, is that if Bernie had won the nomination somehow with the grace of God, uh, that my ideal vice president for him honestly might have been Mary Anne Williamson, and and I feel like I feel that now more than I did even at the time, and I was very. very interested in in marianne at the time, just because I feel like she is one of the very few figures in public life who articulates in any way, even if it's from the point of view of like west coast, new age bullshit, the the reality of um of our spiritual lack, and she had a tweet today that I thought really really reminded me that we're on the same waveleng, caterpillars disintegrate into a soup of imaginal cells out of which emerges a butter. fly, that's where the world is now, one way of being is disintegrating, people are imagining new ways of doing and thinking about things relating to self and others, it won't stay soup for long, and of course that's not necessarily a good thing, gramshi said, you know, the old world is dying, the new world is yet to be born, this is the time of monsters, but it's also the time of miracles, it is a it is a liquidified uh uh, it's liquidified uh earth, like you now during an earthquake you move so fast that the fucking ground itself turns into it has the viscosity of liquid, we're there, and what comes out of that is up to us as terrifying as that is to think about and as hopeless as it might make you think when you consider how far all of us are from god in a real sense from love, we're also all we have and the only. thing that could do it, and we're here, and that's fucking something, bye-bye.
