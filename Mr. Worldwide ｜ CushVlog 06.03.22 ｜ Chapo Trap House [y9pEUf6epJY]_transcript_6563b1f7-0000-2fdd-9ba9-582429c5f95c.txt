 You keep saying you got something for me, something we call love, but confess, you've been looking where you should have been looking, now someone else is getting all your best, these boots. made for walking, that's just what they all do, one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you, you keep saying when you are to be a changing, and you keep thinking that shall never get burnt, but i just bought me a brand new box of matches, what i know you ain't had time to learn, these boots are made for walking and that's just what they'll do, one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over, are you ready boots? start walking, hi folks, Today we are talking about chapters three and four of Sam Ginden and Leo Panish's making of global capitalism for once I said it correctly making of not rise of it's not the goddamn uh Star Wars universe it would be funny if it was called like the making of the jedi instead of or the making of the skywalkers instead of rise of skywalkers um so this is a chapter where after having in the first first two chapters laid out the way that the American state capacity uh to intervene in a global economy was built during uh uh the 19th century and then crucially uh the period between world war 1 and world war 2 uh and after war 1 the US uh had an incredibly important and influential and you could argue uh uh preeminent position in the global economy like that is world war 1 at the world war 1 is when America becomes a global creditor and not a debtor for the first time, but the capacity which you know existed to create a domestic de capitalism by that point did not exist to really impose a US-led international settlement on the world, instead you had uh a British led you know global trade network that was still based on spears of imperial influence, and when you know it, world war, the crisis of the great. comes along, the big collapse happens and all of those tenuous networks of international cooperation snap, everyone turns inward, they go to war again inevitably, as well has to happen uh buse in those kind of crisis you have unsustainable internal press that have to be reckoned with, you can either have a revolution or you can have a war, one or the other, no opting out of it when you have that level of crisis in in uh conditions that... capitalism will not uh cannot assimulate and at the end of that war who's the last man standing the us the way baby and so now we had a situation where a US state that has grown massively in its internal capacity its ability to regulate it's ability to manage economic structures uh because of this explosion in bureaucracy and uh and not just like in the public sector but like uh the... the management revolution among capitalist enterprises means you have this uh and also something that's not spoken of too much about this period is that during the massive wartime capital accumulations that are occurring uh what do you know it you have a huge technological uh boom too so there's this second industrial revolution in chemical transportation and uh communication technology that happens in the 30s to the 40s uh that then also allows for state capacity to be magnified and therefore now we have a country we have a situation finally after one more giant global war that nearly kills everybody uh we finally have a situation where the United States has sufficient internal uh domestic political capacity bureaucratic capacity uh and and currency and a currency uh that can manage a global capitalist economy. and we have a situation where the US state has to take point here, because even though it is in the best interest of... in general for Europe to be rebuilt and for free trade, some some regime of like uh relatively unrestricted trade to be enforced, there are still elements within capitalism who are threatened by what that would mean and who resist it, and whereas the formal state after war one wasn't strong enough to really push through that, this formal state that exists now, has by far uh sufficient capacity to overcome those uh those unorganized individual like interest groupings and point them towards uh a a a new horizon of global capitalism so the model for this new new global capitalism is of course going to be the American new deal regulatory state because that's who's going to be imposing it. Who else would they fucking get any ideas from? They just did this in America, now they're going to... export it to the world uh and that means we're going to have capitalism, but it's going to be capitalism that is checked by regulatory agencies and a general redistributive redistributive political economy where the where the laboring classes will having lost their political power like their ability to like assert uh you know control over conditions of manufacturer which they were threatening. to you know grasp there during world war 2 uh that's gone but what will be left is this mechanism where they can make demands of profit they can say we have a percentage of this profit we are oded it and the political structures that will be brought into being will allow for those demands to be uh taken into consideration by uh people at the heights of the political. which did not was not true uh before this point and which is why you kept having this cycle cycle of massive economic collapses in warfare. now the state department, which you think would have been riding heard on this, during the war is basically not. involved, it's it's the project of the treasury department under the direction of the guy I talked about last time, Harry Dexter White, who was this blue blood uh new dealer who uh helped shape the agreement to come and who was, I guess it's not fully confirmed, there's still some people who don't buy the evidence, but he's widely considered to be and suspected to be a actual soviet spy, which is very funny of course, so it was the treasury department that quarterbacked the Brett. woods agreement, which is the structure that will facilitate the creation of a global capitalism after war to, by uh, and what it's going to do is it's going to facilitate investment in European economies uh that will guarantee US capital, building back up the uh the destroyed nation states of Europe, but giving, but creating uh systems within them where uh fiscal discipline, this is the word that they always talk about, is always imposed uh from the central node of Washington, basically getting rid of the spheres of influence, getting a relatively equalized market with all rules imposed by the United States, and the one and the thing and there are institutions that were built that were that were going to do this like the world bank and the IMF which are going to guarantee private loans uh to European governments. on conditions of like certain structural relationships within their economies and more than anything ensuring that capital controls that is a government's ability to stop for uh stop people with capital foreign investors and domestic ones from moving their capital out of the country which is what you do if you're a capitalist and you don't like what the government's doing it is the final veto how well this is understood but the final. forgetting all their control over and outsized influence over political outcomes, the final veto, the capital concentrated capital has over government policy, discrete nation state policy is capital flight, leaving and capital controls prevent that, and one of the reasons that wall street was pid about Bretton Woods and actually had to sort of be coral by the US government on it, was because they were af. and worst of all that these governments might pursue full employment over price stability, because those are the two things you can pursue as like a nash if you are going to uh take the handles of a govern of a of an economy because what we're doing here with this new new global capitalism is we're breaking the old the spell of the British imperial uh capitalist model like there what the the gold standard um British trade emper that ruled in the 19th century and was undone by the world wars was premised on a religious, ideological, deeply embedded, transcendent belief in the inviability of markets, like you could have some sort of government policy over overrolling markets, but of course it would be molagine inherently, there can be no, no virtuous intervention in the market, of course is all fantasy, the state is making the market, the state is determining the conditions the market operates on, there is no separation, it is purely ideological, but who's going to tell these people that they're wrong, who will they ever encounter that's going to say, actually that's not true, now that becomes unsustainable after world war ii, your world war to prove the unsustainability of it, so now this new... um the new uh truce the capital is willing to have with this embolden government uh formal government structure state structured is say okay fine the government can intervene to set industrial policy now that that's settled and we we we've we've we're willing to uh to uh we're going to stipulate that we can now assert that okay, there is inevitable intervention, there can be good or bad intervention, because there's two things you can do with your overall like monetary policy, like the central bank authority that like regulates economic flows, you can, you can orient it around full employment, or you can orient it around preventing inflation, price stability they call it, because if you do have full employment, you're going to uh "unless you exproperate, this is the thing, unless you exproperate from capital, you will have inflation. now of course, once again, well why don't you expropriate from capital? the forces insisting upon that aren't on the stage, they're caralled in uh the Soviet Union and they're they're uh hidden away in warrens, they're crypto, uh, uh, they might be there like as fellow travelers, but they cannot assert within the imperial core, they cannot assert an alternative to this because they've been defeated." uh, but given the structure, if we're assuming capitalism cannot be violated, if we're assuming that the class structure of the societies, and then the greater global crash structure of capitalists and and and and workers broadly, capital and labor, if you assume that difference, that distinction and you assume that that capital that profits of production must flow to capital, then full. will being inflation, which is why they create they were able to create in this era a new theology where the great, the cardinal virtue of a central banker or a regulator is to keep inflation low. now of course, again, they could have pursued, they could have used this new machinery to uh create full employment, but the problem with that. "the reason that that inevitably leads not to inflation, but to the experparation of capitalism, is that you can't just have an economy, if if your government is uh, is imposing full employment right, as its mandate, the question immediately becomes employed doing what, and what that requires, answering that question requires, is a social project." Now the problem with the Soviet Union is they never got to that level because the so these the uh the because the the the world revolution never happened and the tides went back and Russia was the only redout uh the answer to that question Russia was always uh prevent being extinguished by the west, peat on capitalism's terms to to win in the world contest a battle against capitalism, which is why... no coincidence that the same time they're creating a productivist consumer economy in the west Krustshev is uh transitioning Soviet policy around consumption in the east. but here we have at the creation, does the secretary of state undertruman uh, dean atchesson called his memoirs of this period, present at the creation. everyone understood that this is the forging of a new reality here, um, so the idea of like using full employment to uh essentially youthenize the rentiers, which Kanes always imagined being the the the outcome of the... warm road that he uh envisioned, but because the people who could actually veto all of these decisions the made by the state, which are capitalist not labor uh are obviously existentially opposed to that possibility, they impose a logic of price stability on these new uh regulatory structures and the thing that's going to do it. is the US dollar, that's what's going to uh stand in is like the the the the uh our international like uh economic eucarist, this thing that that holds the the mystery that we cannot actually speak of, that undergirds the theology of capitalism, which is always there, but which is by definition uh sublimated, because the the the fantasy of capitalism is that there is this: desacralized market space that we operate in, but that just uh abstracts uh the sacred into uh capitalist trade itself, because as I said, if you have full employment as a as a principle, then you have to answer the question, what do we, what are these people working on, what are they making? and that has to have a social answer, what capitalism does is it answers that question by uh, pointing to... the inherent alienation of living in a in a world where uh one works on behalf of another, one spends their time, their labor time on earth, their essence at the behest of someone else, and that is spiritual uh uh arsenic, and the whole, you know, the early 20th century was a battle about who is going to control uh these these newly created uh technological regimes of economic production, and the answer is the capitalist, but that there's still tons of workers and in Europe especially, they are very organized a lot of the time in the west, even with communist parties that were saw their uh influence rise during the war because they were the only ones, excuse me, they were the only ones that actually fought the fucking fascists, everybody else just uh either collaborated or stood on the sidelines. and they're making in demands on behalf of workers. some demands are going to be veto by capital, but others are acceptable, and the big one that ends up defining the entire era is we in exchange for essentially uh... politically nutering the working class, it happened in the US with the second red scare, happens in uh Europe, honestly with like gladio more than anything, um, in exchange for that though, you can sublimate that lost autonomy over your life that the political struggle would have provided with the ability to consume, the ability to pursue purchases that will make your life the time you do spend outside of work, your unalienated time, but it's still alienated because you're thinking about the time that you spend elsewhere, and you're dealing with the toll, the literal physical toll of having done that, but it makes that time disproportionately pleasurable, and this is this is uh, that engine is what has fuled the economy uh ever since the creation of this global system, and it's is in fundamental existential conflict with the biome with the earth with the... the ecoological matrix that we are inherently embedded in. now technology is trying to win a race with nature basically. that's what the the elon musk wing of capital that that like the the fantasy that we're all tell that we're all imbibing every day about how we're going to get out of this intractable conflict is the idea that capitalism or that technology will just outpace and outrun nature. it's done it so far, but we'll see if that's going to keep happening. i think it's in'. to uh to depend on it, which is all we're left with with capitalism, so there's this battle, that is, i guess it's it's a sublimeted battle, because the war just happened, nobody really wants to fight anymore, so what they do instead is is that they they enter into this political negotiation that se is a a treaty with the working class uh made in the US and in Europe and the difference in the structures that come out of that are reflected in the difference in the class composition and relative power of the competing class elements in these societies. so you want to know why don't we have all the cool stuff Europe does? it's because in the immediate aftermath of world war to the working classes of Europe were more organized, more radical. uh and uh more socially uh insolidarity uh than than uh the American working class like they had for example dedicated socialist parties which could coordinate their actions in electoral lines all we had in the United States is the democrats were always were for never a socialist party whose associations with the uh labor movement came at long after the fact to the party's creation, I'm sorry, but the PMC is not what drives a wedge between the working classes, at least it's not the only thing that does so, in the American context, the working class has always been fatally uh fractured by the reality of uh slavery. corporation, there have been efforts, as always a a huge push to try to go against that tide, with some effect, some effect and sometimes effective, some not, but that's just not something that European working class politics had to deal with, it's playing it on easy mode, basically compared to the US, and so everybody gets some sort of deal all based on. activist consumer economies where we're making stuff, we're making big durable goods for people to buy, we're going to the people who make them are then going to be given enough money to be able to buy them, and we're going to trade among nations, and when we we can we can offload surpluses and and deal with uh uh with the the ever present capitalist danger of overproduction through trade, and we can do a balance of trade that that keeps uh relatively. happy keeps capital flowing, keeps profit accumulating and keeps some percentage of that capital flowing downward in the form of redistribution through high wages. so it's interesting though about the uh about the imposition of Bretton Woods, which as I uh is that it was uh resisted by a lot of US capital, because they were afraid of this these mechanisms being used to uh pursue full employment and like regular, there's still regular uh like reactionary middle class voters who are like the center of gravity of one of the two political parties who are just psychially hostile to any notion of foreign entanglements and don't have the a familiarity with like the reality of global trade networks and finance and their necessity to keeping the capitalism that they depend on, the small business and small manufacturing capitalism that they depend on going, they don't know any of that, they fill in the gap of their ignorance with ideology, which is what we're doing all the time. of course our our understanding and familiarity is ideologized too, but at a different level of abstraction here, because these people are fixed geographically in like the middle of the country for the most part, Robert Taft representing Ohio, uh, they don't they're they're building it, they're ideologize. understanding of these concepts on a completely sand basis, whereas eastern capitalists who end up going to war with them over American politics in the next decades, are at least dealing with like the the necess necessary realities of building these institutions and keeping political uh keeping uh global capitalism going and all these things all these forces were arrayed the same way against the league of nations and then they were able to defeat it, the league of nations failed to be ratified by the United States, and the United States never ended up joining it, even though it was Wilson's brainchild. now in contrast to that, the state capacity that has been built up and the technology that the state capacity can be utilized words like radio for example means that uh the US state can put on an unprecedented propaganda effort on behalf of bretton woods tv magazine or not tv but magazines news reels radio ads speeches uh tours all you had with league of nations was poor ass fucking wilson going on a whistle stop tour while dying of uh of a strokes, there's no radio for him to go on, he just had to go place to place while his brain vessels were exploding, here you could force multiply that message throughout uh technology of mass media, and they were able to get Bretton Woods uh pushed through, and uh, that is a dollar imperium uh uh administered by these new international institutions like the world bank and the IMF and this thing called the committee on economic development which uh was created in 1942 and which ended up sort of being the uh the the uh the monastery uh for uh or I guess like the theological seminary for the distribution of the the the uh creation of uh agents of a gospel of high productivity, high employment uh, but a a baseline commitment to capitalism that is then imposed on the rest of Europe, now what that means uh, but to get that uh into Europe, what needs to be, what's needs to happen is the United States economy has to be put on firm, firm ground, and this is an important thing to remember, it's like all this was based on the US's hugely powerful economic engine of this period, and the thing is in the immediate post war period there was a real fear of another depression, because I mean you had huge inflation right after the war, you had a huge strike wave as all of the uh unions that had agreed to a no-strike pledge during the war to win the war, all started like assisting on uh making good all the things that had been uh promised them and and then deferred. All those chickens came home to roost 20% of the workforce was going to be reintegrated into it because that's that's how many that's the the percentage of uh workers were represented by the demobilized army of the United States after World War II uh and and that the that basis was made by the deal I talked about earlier. labor peace, cheap mortgages for white workers, uh, high wages connected to productivity uh, and political uh castration in the form of the second red scare, and that is what uh, then becomes the engine uh of the post war economy that spreads to Europe through Brenton Woods and the Marshall. plant so breden woods uh comes down to uh creating a dollar imperium right uh which is a funny it's a war between uh between our guy uh Harry Dexter White and uh John Maynard Kanes who wants to use this uh this trade currency called the bank or which you could argue was just a way to keep the pound sterling on the table um but that's defeated, we get dollar hegemoneny uh, but then you have this remaining problem of, how do you pump up these ravaged European economies and that is the other the one two punch of uh brettonwoods and marshall plan and the marshall plan is direct US money pumped into the European economy uh in 1948 and 1949 uh uh marshall plan money represents 15% of the GDP of the UK, Italy and France, 25% of the GDP of West Germany. And all this money is dependent upon. you know these economies that are being built back up conforming to certain expectations of what uh of what a responsible, democratic, freedom loving country is, and one of the big rais they do that is that uh, is that there's all these new orgs, these new organizations and these new central banking. institutions and lending institutions that are now all going to be staffed and they're all staffed, not coincidentally by idealogues of that religion of uh inflation that I talked about that sees inflation as sin because it sees uh worker power over the economy as sin. the same way 19th century gold capitalism imagined intervening in the market as sin, that is no longer viable. now intervening in the market on behalf of workers is the sin, intervening uh into the economy, into the market on behalf of capital, in the form of fighting inflation, imposing uh price stability, that is virtue, that is a aligning oneself to the will of God. Now of course the funny thing is is that the Soviets asked, hey, we'll get that Marshall plan, and of course you could say, oh, that's being disingenuous, because they would have wanted you, to keep stampeding over Europe, but I really don't think that's true, I think the Soviet Union was willing to go to a a much more radical place of cooperation after the war, but the thing about that is, it would have undermined capital's control over dictating... these conditions shaping this post war world, and they didn't want to, and they didn't have to let that happen, because the fucking soviets were, they were exhausted, couldn't keep them more going, they didn't even have a nuke yet. and so now all these bankers were going to determine what these uh these new economies and these new these newly pulled back up these newly affirmed states what they can do and of course it's going to be on capitalism's terms but with some formal uh some formal mechanism for accommodating working class demands but only in the in the direction of consumption. All right, so that brings us to chapter four, launching global capitalism, so Brenton Woods, Marshall Plan in in the offices of the state and treasury, they build these uh networks, they build, they build, they build this program, the software, and then they got to actually uh, build the machine to run it, as in an actual uh economy in Europe that can fix into the US trade network, because the thing that's motivating all of this is the understanding at the highest levels of US government policy. that capitalism could not be sustained in the United States without capitalism being sustained in western Europe. They understood that they were inextricably linked. now that right there, that understanding coming from you know imperial work towards the goal of winning a war, where the amount of ideological mystification that you allow yourself uh is has to be minimized, still exists, never go. was away, but at a uh a lower level of abstraction, or I'm sorry, a higher level of abstraction, that knowledge, that that reality, that experience, I should say above anything else, that experience of winning the war of building the state capable of winning the war, did not happen in the hinterland of America where America's uh reactionary political heart uh politics is going to emerge and that now dominates the... Republican party that was originally uh instantiated by Ohio Republican Senator Robert Taft who said fuck all this fuck Bretton Wood. fuck the UN, fuck international cooperation, because uh, we're going to keep American capitalism pure by keeping it uh away from dirty foreigners, they didn't have the experience to know that that wasn't true, what they had instead to fill in the gap of experience was the ideologized fantasy of what American capitalism is, they can only be uh sustained by them because they're living mainstreet USA lives where the violence of the system has been totally abstracted away from them and turned into... to uh labor relations and so that is where the resistance to this whole thing is going to emerge and is eventually going to take over the republican party and now dominates it and does want to see the global system of capitalism overthrown because they have an an ideal ideologized fantasy that they can maintain it uh discretely, although i would argue at this point there are probably some like super rich republicans, super rich guys like peel, like the billionaires who support the republican project, who will that won't work, but don't care, because they think that they have accumulated enough personal capital to sustain capitalism in uh, in like isolated, suspended geographically fixed regions, the archipelago of capitalist. the eternal like luxury uh uh oasis that they think that they've uh that they've been building so uh so steadily so they don't care they that's but everyone below them actually thinks that there is something called like American capitalism that can sustain all the good things that they associate with it without uh global flows without the US reserve currency can't be done but don't know that, so there's an interesting uh thing happens at the at uh during this period where the US is looking at this broken Europe right, this europe that has been completely shattered, and it has to be rebuilt to reconnect it to the US lead international system to circulate the goddamn fucking capital, which has to do, it has to circulate, and it has to circulate at larger and larger intervals, more and more uh elliptical and and extended orbits, that's simpl, that's that is its expansion that is the heart of it, capital must flow and it has to flow over bigger and bigger circuits over time, and it has to start with Europe, now the US could have imposed some sort of like post national order on Europe. say guess what, there are no, you use little stupid west falean nation states, you guys, we can't trust you to fucking run your own shit, because look what you've done, you're over, there's no, and of course, you know, um, stalin didn't even do that in Europe, or in the west, eastern Europe, they kept the the nation states, but they were, but that's because they had the uh, the the structure of the Soviet Union to sort of build on, like the periphery where you just get like more and more formal autonomy as you get farther away from the metropol. uh, but the US could have carved up Europe, but it decided no, these nation states have to be built back up, because capitalism requires the state, because at a fundamental level there is no extracting uh the market from the state institutions that allow it to exist, and so for capitalism to exist in these nodes and then connect to the American uh super node, they need to be uh sustained by political and economic institutions that are national in character, because that is what the reality of European life reproduced, nationality was real, it had been instantiated in the 19th century and then have been uh ritually, violently reaffirmed by the world wars, so this state had to be rebuilt, and as I said, it was rebuilt uh on social democratic lines because of the power of the western working class, you get a labor government take power in uh in UK right as the war ends, the first majority labor government ever, they they take they say, this is honestly the British suck obviously and they're a monster. like they're the people birth this demon into being, they're it's most like sallow accolytes, they're they're the most uh, they're the most hollowed amongst us, give him credit for instead of kissing fucking... Churchill's ass for winning the war and letting him be uh you know uh prime minister for life, they turfed him out immediately as soon as the war was over and they said yeah yeah yeah blah blah blah let's have a national health service and in France now but you know that's that's the reactionary heart of uh of England where like the the radical working class is is very low is is a very low level of influence and power now in France for example that was occupied by the by the uh uh nazis and and dominated by a nazi puppet government, the only real political force that had any legitimacy popularly left were the communists because they instead of accommodating this one way or the other had fucking gotten shot and shot germans and and and and uh persisted in resistance, persisted in resistance to uh fascism, which totally delegitimized the bourgeois parties and representatives, similarly in Italy. you have very powerful communist movements, here we get a higher level of uh like social investment than in other places uh, but here specifically in France and Italy, in addition to just the the uh organizational and influential advantage of capital allied with the United States, like this state structure, this capitalist state structure is the one doling out um... Marshall plan money, which is huge. We also had the other hand, the left hand of this process, if the right hand is the formal regimes of uh of economic power, the left hand, the sinister, the hidden hand is uh military coersion, and uh, at this moment, it is clandestine, because you know we're at the end of the cycle of of conflict of World War One, it's going to rise up in a crisendo until you have the mass slaughter, the formal military mass slaughter of Vietnam, but it starts. off with covert action, it start off with a lying with the Corsacan mobsters who controlled the Marseille ports to break the communist led strikes in the port, alliing with the mafia in Italy to uh bribe and assassinate uh the Christian democrats into a victory over the communists, creating uh stay behind networks of uh formal military and uh and military formal It's essentially an alliance, all all the gladios uh states are an alliance between formal regimes of coersion in in the uh capitalist state structure, the military and their equivalent in the uh the shadow economy, the military of of criminality, which is organized crime, organized, organization is what concentrates uh power, so organized crime and the military, and that combination helps prune the hedges of this uh left-wing alliance that you know asserts power, asserts for a control everywhere uh in Europe uh and one interesting thing that I didn't really know and that uh they point out is that uh we think of the neoliberal formula as something that emerges in the 70s as a result of the those the crisis then but uh uh Panditch or Pandun point out that the birthplace of Newton neoliberalism was Germany West Germany. to the war uh, which at the time it wasn't even neoliberalism, it was called ordo liberalism, very cool name, uh, and uh, the the early Christian democrats who took power at the US Behest after the war, had a much more market-oriented politics than the ones uh in the other uh former uh combatants of Europe, and the reason for that is because the left had been exterminated in west Germany by the Nazis and then the United States was formally occupying it. the same wasn't true in other countries and so they got a more uh pure strain cansianism than west Germany did, but even in west Germany you saw a welfare state emerge so that conflict does not explode because your because you have this epifrent danger. of too much crisis in the center of these countries means you're back to the conditions of World War II, you're back to a thing where there has to be a revolution or there has to be a war. the the social forces that could guide it towards a revolution or or another war have been uh discredited by the disaster of World War II, leaving the only credible alternative the forces internally in these societies that want to push for a goddamn revolution. And that is what the Marshall plan did more than anything was to present prevent this revolution. from happening, because you had a situation in Europe after the war where capital is fleeing to the United States, capital is getting the fuck out of Europe, and American private capital isn't bringing it back in a, after the war America foreign investment stayed in the western hemisphere, in the American sphere of influence, because it could, it was easy, it was the path of lease resistance to Canada and to Latin America, uh, Europe was way too risky for private money to go there, so you had this huge uh outflow of capital in these countries, that's a death spiral, the only way to to get out of it is to either expropriate capital, which of course not an option, or do even more. austerity, which is going to give you a revolution, can't have it, can't have it? can't have him commiserating, i can't have, i can't have, do more austerity, make them stand in line longer for biscuits, i can't, i can't have it, like these guys they just fought a war a lot of them, they just coming home with their guns over their shoulders, the they they've seen death, that's the thing, that's why that was such a moment of possibility is that you had these guys who've been traumatized by the war, which is you know that... up in the interwar period benefiting mostly reactionary politics because the left was cucked, but by the end of the war, second world war, you had like a bunch of leftists who were ready to fight way more than had been before, but what made them make a deal instead of fight is cuuse instead of that harshening austerity, marshall plane fant fucking uh uh made it rain prevented. money and this is a thing that and then they built up these states that have regulatory regimes that regulate capitalism, they that that guarantee redistribution of profits, all stuff that a capitalist in his narrowest interests doesn't want, but which were necessary for the the continuation of capitalism, which is why you need that. capacity which we have seen in America be dissolved by the post-70s world. now we're in a situation where the inherently cannibalistic nature of capitalism that has uh essentially always uh is deferred through redistribution of surplus, no longer has the surplus, so all of those surplus redirected politically. is the motor oil and the engine of capitalism, and the oil hasn't been changed since 1973 basically, so all of these fucking parts are just spraying sparks off of one another, because the discrete interests of capital have to be short term, it's the state, which is just the capital like through a mirror, it's like the other lobe of the brain of capital, people who are capitalists and operate for capital's interest, but through the institutions of uh bureaucracy and politics rather than uh uh like ownership and management have a view of it that is more comprehensive and that can that can interven to sustain its longevity, can't do that anymore, which is why the longevity is not being sustained, and so this is a process, this liberalization of Europe have starts here, like we have a social democratic treaty signed in the late 40s between labor and capital in the western Europe on the conditions imposed by the Marshall plan by this dollar hegemoneny which said for example that every dollar of marshall fan money that a government of uh in these European country would get they had to commit to spending an equivalent amount of their domestic currency on projects that had to be approved by the United States. like that were within a American-approved rubric of policy options, that's how they were able to direct this flow, but they didn't direct it towards creating like mini somalias, like free market utopias, like the psychos who took over Iraq did after uh, the invasion there, because they knew that that was not a way to create a stable state structure, people who the psychos who took over the Iraqi government and the Iraki uh political economy in the in the early auts genuinely believe that the way you stabilized economy is by unleashing uh uh entrepreneurship or whatever else because they've been propagandaized they've been ideologically uh processed into believing that so that they don't even know it's not in capitalism's interest to do that it's not in the greater interest the project of stabilizing Iraq as a note of American power projection in the Middle East which is what we were trying to do there and the very thing we did trying to make it happen und did it and made it impossible because of those ideological blinders. which is why it's so funny that Rumsfeld is the guy responsible for like the most excsinct expression of like the reality of of of ignorance in our in our the functioning all of our social institutions, science, government, policy, everything is is the unknown known or the unknown, unknown, so the creating these states that regulate capitalism in the interest of the combined class interest of American capitalism, even though there are individual capitalists who are pissed about this, who do don't want it to Who are trying to resist it, as I said, the same time this is happening, the Krushchev or I mean after, once this is like really this process take takes a hold in the 50s and you see this really work, like there's initially a terror that oh god what about uh uh, what about these European economies? what if they can't uh grow at the rate that they need to to keep redistributing uh, you know, keep the capital flowing and keeping everybody relatively uh, socially stable and comfortable. uh, trying to find this thing i wrote, what was it? so i wrote something on one of these, i can't find is this it, i did this very poorly, i'm sorry uh, i forgot where i wrote it, but i i remember what it is, so uh, the way they're able to do this, the way we're able to kickstart this thing is not just putting in a bunch of money uh It's by facilitating trade between European countries so that instead of the US just dumping a bunch of money into Europe and then them all just like distributing it and you know consuming uh exports from the United States mostly uh they are going to be domestically producing and the only way to do that is if they're trading with each other is if they're taking that money and they're buying stuff from each other and the way that they facilitate that is creating a uh a a clearing house where even though this is a dollar economy and everything is priced in dollars at the end of the day uh but the dollar is at this point scarce because all this capital slowing to the us uh and there's not there just aren't enough dollars unless you want inflation do you uh to facilitate all of this European trade there's a clearing house that allows uh these countries to trade with each other. in each other's devalued currency because there is a huge uh devaluation of European currencies that happens after the war and the unpegging the uthanization of the of the pound sterling uh which had been the uh reserve currency uh before the war and you know cains fought for it uh fought for Sterling he told that Whitehall when he was trying to sell Rettenwoods to them that he fought for Sterling but at the end of the day Sterling was yuthanized but the British got a really good deal off it they got the same way the Dutch had earlier, they got to be bought out of their controlling share of global capitalism and then given a golden parachute, like the british, the British did that to the Dutch, and then the Americans did it to the British, and they were able to build their welfare state, they were able to build their uh, their NHS and their and their estate housing, and they were able to build this you know durable system on the back of a trade regime there, the US. basically uh gave them favored status, like the US was trying to get rid before the war of the British tariff regime that like uh favored that um like that was that gave preference i should say that gave preference to trade within the commonwealth within the empire uh and they created you know like uh a more equitable uh trade relationship after the war, but during the... austerity years, the early austerity years of Britain, the US suspended that and sort of did voluntary uh trade restriction with England to help their domestic uh economy uh grow back up and you know we owe it to them because it was the it's British systems of imperial and bureaucratic control that we then took to take over the world like the the CIA was made by the Brits, they they they'... and also like these uh this this economic structure created is is the vision of like the reformist minds of uh of English political economy, the special relationship, I mean think about it, the glorious revolution is essentially like this this merger between uh the Dutch and the English, capitalist classes, one of those inverdent deals where like you you switch headquarters, and that meant that the dutch were no longer a colonial power, but they were able to maintain their dynamic trade economy in this in this European system, that is now headquartered in Britain. if the dutch had held on to North America, it would have probably gone the other way around, and probably on much more. stating conditions for the British, because uh, you know, the pityy little island, but Britannia rules the waves. So, so you have this new system where US capital is flowing in to to make up deficits, to to provide. like oil and energy and food inputs to allow capital elsewhere to go towards uh investment in the economy build and and the all that money that us money simulates demand for products and they come from other European countries and that that those gears kick in to going and the whole contraption starts flapping across uh but of course it's not just these countries that make up the post war. global economic order uh they have it has to extend elsewhere uh like for example the deal the uh rosevel administration makes with the house of sad to uh ensure access to uh oil on American terms which isn't so much about American consumption because that the US is is is by far the world's largest oil exporter before and during the war but its domestic demand for oil is going to explode uh so the the oil that used to be exported is domestically consumed and that Saudi Arabian oil can then be used to uh fuel capitalism in Europe, but that's only possible because we create a uh alliance between the you know the tribal uh rulers of uh of the peninsula. that gives them you know privilege that power, recognizes them as sovereign uh, in exchange for them being just a part of the US like formal uh global alliance. there's actually a funny thing in here where they point out that at the time uh coal and oil were in competition and a lot of uh planners said that they preferred oil because so many coal mines. were uh in communist countries, whereas proven oil reserves at this point uh are concentrated in places that the like the US or places the US could diplomatically uh overall like Saudi Arabia and it's very important that this oil is secure because I said earlier right, these economies are based on uh filling the gap, the hole in the heart created by capitalist exploitation, right? what are we doing, what are these people being put to? work for, they're being put for, put to work to build stuff for people to buy, so they can feel better about their lives, and what is the thing, the one uh commodity that represents this entire commodity relationship, does anyone know, the er commodity of the fordist era, i said, i gave it away right there in the name, the car? correct, the automobile, the personal automobile represents in commodity form all of the freedoms that are denied to the worker, the freedom over time and space that are denied when you are forced to spend time in a space, demand determined by your boss. a vehicle allows you to traverse time and space in your own, at your own.... will right, because like nobody wants to go at foot speed anywhere, nobody ever has, it's too slow, especially in a media. world where you know where uh where stimulation is easier to come by, you need speed to actually exert will, and so you can command will, demand, control the environment, be the god that you can't be during your working time with a car, and it's big and it's expensive, and they look different, so your aesthetic preferences can be represented in them, there is a different style, and that style can reflect you. as a point of at at the level of identity, and they can give you control over your environment, literally over time and space, because remember like what had what had restarted the global economy, war armaments, big machines, that's what we had built our industrial economy around producing, tanks, airplanes, engines and that had to be put to... use they had to be switched to domestic uh means quickly because if you keep if you build militarily you have to destroy it, that's the thing, that is the mil, that's the cycle of military expenditure, like Hitler built, Hitler built tanks and that means you have to use. tanks, now of course, if you sell everybody a car, you get to the point where they run out a car, everyone's had a car, then you have a collapse, unless more and more people are buying cars, younger and younger people are buying cars, new workers are buying cars, you know, unless it can, it can operate in the logic of exp of endless expansion, and so the automobile becomes the pivot of this global supply, this global capitalist uh uh a trade network, the US builds cars for American consumption more than anything, but also exports them. Europe, the European countries, the bigger ones, build cars for domestic consumption and also trade. even in and so uh, while they're doing this in Europe with the cars and everything and trying to f create this industrial capitalism around automobile construction. which again, how much at this point, right? we know what cars have done to the world, we know what car based culture has done to community, to identity, to sanity, to the biome, we know, we know that it might, it's going to be a big part of what dooms us, and that is fundamental to capitalism, like they're looking for a solution to a a problem, how do we how do we fuel this economy after this war? and because there assumptions are capitalism. be persisted, they create a short-term fix that in the long run creates even greater contradictions. yeah, like this is a good example, somebody says, so cuba did this, right? Cuba actually did the deal where you take over the economy from a central position of planning and you socially figure out what to do, right? now of course, their answer was partially uh determined by the fact that the US embargo meant that they weren't going to get enough they were. not going to get enough uh materials to be able to build much, us made sure of that, so what do they do instead? what was something that could be could be manufactured without imports and the answer is uh health expertise, you could democratize health, so that larger and larger portion, a state directed portion of... your population has the sort of detailed hyper-expert understanding of the human body that can only be bought by the extension of surplus on it, people can't be doing other stuff, they've got to be fucking training to be doctors and you take that surpluss and you train people to be doctors and actually they've actually been able to turn this into a way to get capital into the country uh by exporting um that... paying for their education, the way that we're expected to just take out giant loans, so this this idea of building up individual industrial economies wherever they can, so they can trade with each other is the superseding goal of us policy at this time, so that even in America, which had been the place that we had destroyed uh, all popular politics that demanded like control of resources, because US capital needed cheap access to their agricultural surplus. That was the whole open-door policy that was like the fixation of the state department during the 30s, keeping access to raw materials from Latin America at American dictated prices, that meant keeping the left in check. that meant keep propping up uh dictators when you're weren't overthrowing the governments themselves uh but even during this period not for a long time but during this period specifically uh us policy towards Latin America where which was getting US private investment when Europe wasn't uh was to encourage domestic production this the the the uh developmentalist philosophy the kensianist basically of the developing world after World War II was called uh import substitution industrialization where because uh the the the answer the non-communist answer to the challenge of how do you catch up to the west from the from the you know the position of of colonial stagnation that Latin American countries were in and and African ones too Asians as well like the periphery the global south um "the reason that they were in this prostrate position and they couldn't accumulate capital is because they were dependent upon industrial export, imports, they had to import anything durable, because all they had were their agricultural products, which were sold at cheap prices, which meant that nobody could buy uh enough to sustain domestic production, you so the people who could buy had to buy in imports, which means your balance of trade is fucked, you can never develop domestic capacity." uh so uh that means that you needed a state project of uh substituting imports with domestic production, instead of taking taking in x, we're going to build x, and that means the biggest, the most the most popular imports have to, there has to be an industrial policy of producing them domestically, and the US, the're in the 50s encouraged this, but of course there is an inherent. industrial capitalist economies, because the center is always going to have its stability prioritized over the periphery, so it sacrifices isi in third world because it could no longer be afforded. Meanwhile, in the in the third world at this point, like Africa and and Asia, the places that have been till very recently all been colonized by Europe, there were no developed state structures to build up, and so capital investment was minimal, and so you had a situation where the economy such as existed was fixed into this uh cycle of of of money going out the door as you produce cheap uh cheap agricultural products cheap resources uh where all the profits are concentrated by the the the very narrow uh political uh class and bureaucratic class uh and and like the large land owners of course uh and basically nothing left for a domestic uh consumer economy to buy, and that which can be bought has to be imported, and then that is the relationship between the the real periphery, and and and the center for the rest of till this moment, you never have that moment of industrial production because they never get the conditions that allow for it, which are high trade barriers. the US built its industrial economy with tariffs. England did too, and as I said, um, even the post war world still has uh, you know, uh, it does not have free trade, it has freeer trade, but it does not have free trade. meanwhile, the by the time you do have like sufficient state structures to assert, you know, a political project in the in the periferal countries, by that point uh, the regime is uh, actually no, there's it's totally free trade, and you get to negotiate. you get to negotiate from the same atomized position against concentrated capital that the individual worker does against uh an owner of a factory, which is why China is important, because China is the only country, the only country in the colonized world. that spent the 20th century building state capacity, building industrial capacity and not having it imposed on him outside from the west, and yes, the reason for that is, it's gigantic, and it's been a unified political unit, or it's been a coherent political uh uh uh entity for 2000 years. which is not true of any of the other places, including India by the way, India didn't come into being as its own thing really until the rage, 5,00 years, yes, whatever, I don't buy any of that stuff, by the way, the idea that there's uh an extension of like uh Chinese state uh structure that extends like into the deep like iron uh uh like uh neolithic, don't buy it. sorry, they're very precocious for state production, uh, state, state uh uh development, but uh, no, they they started off the same place that everybody else did, uh, and it was all trial and error, I think they did get it first, and they were able to sustain at longest, but then you're just trying to, all that is is it's an attempt to you, affirm the authority of the existing structure, which to me, I'm sorry, that doesn't affirm shit, I don't care how long fucking sanding the thing is at the end of the day. because these things have to be transcendent, I'm sorry. The rest of the colonized world is uh, is to the is to the west as like a concentration of a constellation of social of uh, if you define the west as like a constellation, a constellation of uh, of cultural values, uh, economic. political uh interlocking regimes of power and structure uh the indiv, there is no other state but China that can stand to that uh, of course Japan, which is basically China, but like packed into a little archipelago, and in that it's this, you know, hugely dense concentration of of people and therefore capacities, they at... end up somewhere between Europe and the third world after the war, because their working class had been decapitated by fashism just as Germany's had, their post war uh accommodation with labor is much more business-friendly, and the US also by the way, does Gladio shit in Japan, the yakuza, that that was stood, the yakuza as we understand it, organized crime in Japan, was stood up by the United States, occupying uh forces, like they made formal and informa agreements with like networks of smugglers uh and and like black marketeers uh who they gave state sanction to the activities of because they would kill communists and they ended up becoming like a a fucking arm of the state like a a they are the most formally powerful of any of the organized crime structures that emerged after world war 2. like in Italy they're a parallel state, but they're still all like formally uh illegal, but like yakuzas sponsor uh like charity shit like formally in uh in Japan, you know, they they are they are quasi legal uh uh corporate entities, and that's because it happen, those things emerged simultaneously, what we're having? in countries like Mexico is where this like these structures are just they exploded into existence really only in the past 30 years and so that means that they're they are not been able to be... assimilated into the structures of the state, they've just overtaken it almost overnight, and that's not, that is not a uh stable arrangement, that's why it's so horrifyingly violent there relative to the yakuza, so Japan doesn't get a marshall plan, but what Japan gets instead is during the Korean war, Japan is the main staging area for America. is military forces, which means a huge, huge infusion of US money in the form of the the the spending power of American uh military forces who are there on leave or who are there in transit or in support roles, all of the the construction that is uh that is necessitated by these guys uh that economic activity is the infusion that that stimulates uh domestic production in Japan. 6 billion dollars is is pumped into the japan is economy by uh the US military intervention in korea which at the time is gigantic and helps helps uh do the same uh the kensian uh pump priming that marshall plan money does in Europe and that uh private investment does in in the Americas. Okay so next week we will do I oh next week I think I might skip next week I have a a thing I'll be out of town towards the end of the week so when we come back two weeks hence I might do another stream like on Wednesday or something but I will not be uh it would not be the book cuz I want to give the whole week for the for to read the two chapters because you know I know. impossible to read, so I want to give anybody who does read the book chance to catch up, so uh, we'll skip a week and then we'll go back with chap uh part part three, the two chapters that make up part three okay, well I hope everybody has a nice weekend, it looks, it's going to be beautiful here, I hope it's going to look nice where you are, hope everybody keeps it sleezy, peace and chicken grease.
