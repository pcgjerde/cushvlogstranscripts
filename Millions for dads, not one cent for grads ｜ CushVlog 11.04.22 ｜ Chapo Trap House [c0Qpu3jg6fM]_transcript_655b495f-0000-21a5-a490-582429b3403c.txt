 baby when i met you there was peace unknown, i said out to get you with a fine tooth come, i was soft inside, there was something going. song, you do something to me that I can't explain, hold me closer and I feel no pain every beet in my heart, we got something going on, oh yeah. Yeah, tender love is blind, it requires a dedication, all this love, we feel no needs conversation, we ride it together, uh-huh, making love with each other, and in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we go wrong, fail? away with me to another place and we rely on each other, uh-huh, from one cover to another, uh-huh, this does anyone remember that that cover song was covered by um, was it the guy from the fujis who wasn't wycleff, he had a song for the bullworth soundtrack. Am I right? Does that make sense? Does that sound like anything? I'm going to see if I can find the song I'm referring to. I think I might be right. Getto superstar. is it who did get a superstar though? priz, prosz was in the fugies, oh shit i was right, but was it in the boltworth soundtrack? holy fuck, yes it was, i remembered all of that correctly, man, wow, that's what I've got in my head instead of anything remotely useful for any other human being, it's pretty funny, i sacrifice all of my uh, all of my hit points and every other category, and honestly it was a very inefficient choice, uh, probably wouldn't do it again if i had the ch the chance, but what are you going to do? we we we are what we are and i am minmax to the helt all i can do is remember crap that happened have any actual skills. okay so today we're going to say we're going to finally reveal which china book we're going to be doing. Now I got to say I feel a little bad about this because I realized after I asked people to like give me their recommendations and I actually already had a China book that I got on my kindle a while ago I it had been recommended to me I think by Dan denver and so I was like oh I'll check this out and it was short and that really appealed to me so it's like it's like 100 it's almost it's like under 200 pages I think uh and I honestly think since I don't know that much. to start off with about modern China that going general and vague is probably for the best way to start, if we wanted to talk about something more specific we could, we could get pull one of those longer works to people. people have been recommending to me, but anyway, this book is called the China boom, why China will not rule the world, so spoiler alert there for all the people asking, will China take over for the United States, as the new global hegemon, the book seems to be arguing, well not, I tend to agree, I tend to think that whatever comes after American hegemony will be uh post hegemonic, and so China will, it will not uh... It will not recenter the global supply chain, it will instead be one of those structures that um exists to administer crisis capitalism after the breakdown of the uh the political, technological and logistical supply chains that make modern world capitalism possible. means China is every, it's every country for themselves, so China is not going to come to the rescue. I think that's what people kind of wonder when they say like, will China take over, they they imagine, will China rescue us, like we see the coming conflict with China, basically the same way with that the right and liberals do, which is this in inevitable conflict. The only difference is we think they're the good guys, right? It's like, no, this is just like... what Steve Bannon and Joe Biden say China is on a collision course with the United States. The question is who should we be rooting for? And this book seems to be arguing and we'll see as we read it, they're not going to be in a position uh to make that kind of play. They're going to be too busy keeping theirselves uh, on top of the increasingly teatering social structures that are going to come under deeper and deeper. um, crisis, crisis is the name of the game, I mean capitalism is always in crisis, I would argue actually, that class society is always in crisis, because of the inherent conflict between uh classes that drives everything, and I do believe that marks, this is a sink this is the central insight of Marx, it's the uh atomic splitting of the, it's the splitting of the... that makes everything else make sense because all the sudden stuff that has been like had been processed by the enlightenment uh in one context uh uh can be looked at from from an angle and notice oh all this stuff that you're claiming is inherent in human uh history inherent to the to human animal All that stuff is generated by the fact that somebody is working for somebody else and that that puts a dagger in the heart of social solidarity and that that rift has to be managed and that is the crisis that defines all class society and the way that it produces crisis is that it always must seek uh to expand to accompany. for the fact that its internal structure is being eroded, like conquest is what saying maintains these power regimes, because over time they become stagnant and lead to a revolt, it is social pressure, this is like the magma coming up through the tectonic places and it has to be managed, and that everything that we think of religious, culturally, social, all of our values, our notions of language and nation, identity itself are premised on structures that grow out of the need to manage these crisis, and what's keeps crisis, what keeps final crisis at pay is expansion, and the history of society, history of settle human, agricultural, hierarchical societies that emerged, we've talked about how this happened with the the grab grow book, i think that it is very much a thing you had a relatively harmonious con uh social structure where because of the superfluidity of land relative to humans allowed people to really resist any real authority, nobody can actually make anybody do anything for a sustained period of time, you could conquer somebody and kill them or something, you could kick them off land, but you could not um make them like maintain a regime of subservience because they could just go somewhere else. and I think that and because they had the ability, like these are people who had um these people who lived like... in close relationship to their environment, gained their food not through abstract actions that that are given like a value form, but but by uh by their own hand, they could always feed themselves on the land, as well as you know it's better to be together in groups for some reasons, but it's not essential and that that that was a equilibrium, like that's going to create society, it's going to create culture, but it's not going to produce what we think of as uh as cul as society. because it does not leave the same structural rem, the ornamental features of society in which some people are sitting around while other people are doing work, and that is what means, that's what we, looking back on the historical record, that is what we see as civilization, it emerges exactly when settled agricultural, social structures emerge, we can talk about why that specifically happened, i think actually trace it out perfectly correctly. It's just they don't see the implications of what they have uh sketched out, what the what they're sketch, what they sketch out is the notion that so you have these people living in, there's conflict within them, of course, they're humans, but it is not a class conflict, buse there is not a felt class distinction, then more people show up, people start moving around, they start bumping into each other, the best land gets taken, the best place for humans to thrive are found, the place where you can get the most back for the least. work, which is what people are looking for. we all want to work less for our our survival, because why work more? we don't have a weird religious structure around work the way that you do have to have in class society where it is like a ritual inscription, it's just stuff we all do. so why would you want to do more of it? so the loweland places, the places by uh where where you could do agriculture without planting, you could just throw some seeds down and then the... the uh rising river tides or would come in and irrigate it for you, you wouldn't need to use any, you wouldn't have to build a fucking windmill or or have aquaducts or shit and you wouldn't even have to as i said plant, you could just leave the fucking seeds and then boom, you have a supplement to to a uh to a diet, but then enough people show up and oh you got to work a little harder, you're motivated now because your social group to maintain its cohesion has to work a little harder and that means more. unpleasant labor, more stuff that sucks to do, well how do you determine who is going to do it? and this is the where we create the rituals of of the ritual religious world wherein our labors have an abstract relationship, they render us subservient to some, totalizing other that we are worshipful of a god, God is coin. now the people, there's god everywhere every every, God is inheren in every system, just how it's translated from the people within it, and for them they had a god, but it was not this abstracted principle that people had to bring themselves to, and that is why you see that so many of these agricultural regimes are brought into being through. mass ritual bloodshed, this ispecially true in China, the basis of agricultural society in China were these early societies that were carrying out massive, almost industrial scale, um uh sacrifices of enemy captives in war, and that inscribed this, this hierarchy, that blood, it it sanctify. this divines that they a want to connect to, so they have to do something, the thing they do has to mean something, and that is what everybody seeks under class society is, the best thing is to be able to do work that means something, and it does not is not at someone else's direction, but a class society needs that, and conflict between class societies is what sharpens it, and how did it start? before you got there, you had according. you had proto egalitarian societies in the mesopotamian valley, you also had hundred gatherer societies that did like feasting cycles where they would build temporary hierarchies, but then would disperse into total egalitarian lifestyles outside of those time frames, when the it was basically a played at ritualized sense of identity, because the stakes were not there, because class uh conflict did not define those societies, and what they did is they created this first bureaucratic state where like like the fucking canair form was invented to figure out how to distribute... communal uh uh products, the giant warehouses were the centers of these uh, these cities, and within them you see the cataloging of these mass produced items of life, like olive oil and wheat and shit, to be distributed, and you don't see the sort of uh priestly palaces uh, and and and vast displays of ornamental wealth either, and so that becomes a stable equilibrium. but here's the thing, everybody who encounters this world is now encountering a world where they have to uh resolve the conflict between their own individual sense of self, uh and and conception of the world, way of being, and the one imposed, the one that we all have to agree to when you have a society, and that the people are going to get pushed out, and again, there's still enough room that. even though there's now greater concentrations in these uh more uh desirable areas, the more arid, the less the the more difficult to live in areas are still available if you don't like what's going on in these early agalitarian uh urban areas. who gets pushed out? chads, people who want to uh uh young men mostly who want to assert their will in the world due to their fucking testosterone, let's boil it out of that, like the the the the surge within the male of these species towards a will to power, the grasping of it, that is something that is deeper, you could argue than class conflict, because now we're talking about the individual's subjective experience of the world. and the fact that there's another there's a world outside that we're all creating through mutual collaboration and the thing that makes you want to want to uh collaborate, what's wrong? oh shit is the is my audio not correctly plugged in what's does that sound better? Ah shit, well I don't know, I don't know, I got this thing plugged in, reverb, I don't know, I don't know how that fuck, god damn it, this sucks, I don't know how to check that, I'll just unplug this thing and plug it back in, what about this, can you hear? that is it just is it better over the is this better, i'm just doing it through the worse, jesus fucking christ, well congratulations, i have absolutely no idea what the fuck i was talking about, thank you very much, i have no idea what i talking about, fuck, god damn it, whatever, so that you're going to have in a in one of these agalitary and unsettled societies, those guys, they can submit themselves to the ritualized state that these societies have right, on a uh on a seasonal level, like you come together for the fair. and then you've got cops, you've got uh, games, war, you, that kind of stuff, and it gets off, it gets that energy out somewhere, it it uh, blows off the steam, uh, and then you can go back and live, you know, as bands, and and not submit to anybody's authority, because there's so much land that nobody has to fight really, especially since those rituals create this kin relationship, you might stumble onto somebody else's uh, Yeah, but you're part of a same kin group, like they talk about how in early American societies you had these clan systems that didn't correspond to geography, they were spread throughout entire. regions, because you would have people all over the place claiming the same symbols and where are those symbols gain meaning in these ritualized structures of state, but once you get settled, there's no place for it, there's not if there's not war with an external enemy, what are you supposed to do with that energy? and you know you can do sports uh, but for some people it's not going to be enough, and so what's going to - create, be created as as an antithesis to the thesis here emerging of okay, we have to have some sort of extractive relationship to our environment and some sort of hierarchical distribution of labor, because that is key here, you cannot, you in order to make, in order to compete with other social formations doing the same thing, uh, settle society means not only are you doing more labor, but that labor will... be unequally distributed because it's the only way to um, i mean it's the only way to gain the value add of like it being a social product, so you you see settling in the henterland. uh, a different culture, a a warrior culture, a culture around going out and fighting other groups of young men, and the societies that emerge out of that, the Kurgin societies that have been theorized, end up just steam rolling the early uh, um, the early kind of quasi anarchist - city states, and then they take them over and then dominate them from the top, and that's where you see in early Mesopotamian society, the shift from these big communal warehouses and like minimal uh uh uh pageantry and and ornament to this invasively ornamental military dictatorship, which happens when the guys out fighting each other, some of the the ones who do the best live the longest, they've. gather around them the most followers, they procreate, I mean, you literally create this this uh genetic hot, this evolutionary hothouse, the way the finches uh peaks start changing uh, within a few generations in the Galapagos, and then that that time then as soon as those regimes take power, now you have... at the thesis that is now emerged, which is these uh social structures and notions of work and responsibility and religious life that had been kindled in a kind of pre-class society where like social hierarchy existed but it did not confer social status and then and that is when the people who the the step people, the people who go out to stay. in conflict with the world and with each other, they're going to always come back and jack your shit, which is what undermines the entire stupid thesis of stupid gravegrow stupid book, they make this beautiful argument that I think really really helped me get my head around a lot of like how human history is is is is evolved, it's been tremendously helpful, I'm really glad glad i read it, but they just they point out that this order existed before the imposition of class society. therefore we can do anything we want, and it's like, no, man, as soon as that's that society, those society has became uh uh complex enough, and over time complexity is going to emerge, you can't stop that with all of your anarchism, because size is going to continue, populations are going to grow, demands on resources are going to grow, which means the amount of effort, labor that the human body is going to have to do to extract more. calories from the world as more people are born into it, that's the challenge of getting a social human animal in homeostatic relationship with its environment, and class society wants it immerges, drives a stake into its own heart, because in order to operate, it has to assume the conditions that it was generated under, like if we do this, we get this amount of tribute that fuels our system. that lubricates the gears that keeps it going and growing, but as time goes on, because you're just in uh subblemating your some destroying your environment to keep up the consumption of more and more people, and that is putting social pressure, how do we keep in competition with each other, because here's the thing, we are the social animal, but we are divided into tribes, groups along those symbols, those symbols that had helped us, learn why it is good to work, you know, why it is good to to uh... be obligated to your fellow man, like the a vocabulary of like deep religious truth, and as grafted on top of a uh, a religious system that instead codifies a class rule, and and uh, and what that means is that as your relationship to the environment destabilizes over time. because right, you're you're you're extracting x every year right, but y is going away, it's being destroyed in the process, yes there is some regeneration, but over time, this is just basic melthusianism, but it's true, over time you outstrip your environment, and then you can solve that, if you don't want to change how your system works, you can solve that by getting more, deepening, deepening exploitation, deepening the amount of... labor people have to do, forcing them to do more labor, and this is how you get slave societies. oh, here are people who we don't have to treat like people, and that supercharges your ability to ex extract and therefore compete with other social formations, but the whole time, this machine is running on borrow time, because eventually any system reaches its uh, it's extent, it's it's a built because at this point we're talking about discrete social formations like empires occupying specific geographic areas and being bound by them, and they reach a certain point where they can no longer expand because there are other powers there around them that are closer, more concentrated, closer to their own supply lines and and base for power that they can resist your uh overthrow or... can resist your reach, you cannot extend it beyond that geographic center, be it Rome or Istanbul, or Beijing or whatever, and when they reach that point, it's only a matter of time, drouts are going to, there's going to be more droubts, there's going to be more uh famin, uh, there's going to be plagues now, because you've got people living next to animals and generating diseases that are going to fucking run through your population. now that's has one effect, hey, you know, it's cutting down that population growth, but it's also undermining the structural integrity of the institutions, ideological, cultural, technological, that actually make the thing run, the actual like skeleton of it, the missile, not not the superstructure shit, and because you live in the superstructure where your reality is, is our system is just because it is in harmony with God, which is the basic underlying premise, unstated, but expressed different ways culturally, secular, religious, it's all the same, it could be communism, it could be American exceptionalism or fucking political Islam, it's the same idea that our way of being is in correspondence with God's will, and that is expressed through nature, has been since the reformation, and and it goes for every post. religious secular person and every communist and every everybody is operating on that assumption and and so if you are, if the system itself is destroying its ability to maintain itself, well then you violated, you you've committed blasphemy in your heart, and it's very hard to do that, the whole system exists for you to never have that that question brought, that is what ideology does, but it also uh is torn away. by circumstance as the destabilization increases, that is when class, the the reality of class rule becomes more uh apparent, if you start exploiting the slaves too much, or even while you're exploiting them, you're getting less out of them, and therefore the structures that hold them, like the knives at their back, are the the rows of of of military that is a state expense, it's no longer affordable and all of a sudden uh cracks get begin to show, or conflict between elites for the... scraps leaves everybody to not even being paying attention and then not even noticing what the slaves are doing, that's a good haidi is a good example for that. yes of course I'm saying all modern. what i'm saying, all modern famins are man-made, going every class society famin is man-made in the sense that it is in conditions of these this de unstable relationship with the environment because you can't move, you cannot accomodate changes in weather in a specific place, you can't all just sort of get out of the way of mother nature's fickle wimbs, you're planted, you're struck, you're set up, and that means that when the food goes away, you're gna have to mostly stay there and try to extract more from it and some of you are going to die and who's going to die most? those at the bottom because they have the least power, but those are some of the things that over time eat away at the legitimacy of your state, and then it collapses and now we're in the first time in human history where uh there is there is no exterior thing that we're bumping against. like up until you could argue 1991 capitalism is still bumping against something else the same way that you know that the chin the king dynasty uh bumped up against uh Mongolia uh and even a could bump against England and uh and and the United States and France uh there's nothing to bump against it is a global system so this the the the crisis is worst. are ones that uh cannot be resolved by a collapse that is then to the benefit of all those neighboring states right like a collapse leads to local power being maintained because at the local level people are self-sufficient enough to keep their heads and keep their social structure like the collapse of the Roman empire for example is really the collapse of a trade network the local centers of power basically stayed intact. some cities got rampaged by the the goths or something, but for the most part those those germanic tribes just became the new tributory uh uh warlords of a system that was still basically intacked at least in southern Europe. um like one of the big cultural conflicts that you see emerge in medieval Europe is between those areas that maintain relatively robust social structures uh after the collapse of Roman empire like southern France. uh and northern Italy versus the more uh feral northern sector, including of course England where the collapse of Roman power was essentially overnight and total uh as opposed to the much more gradual process that was in some places basically undetectable uh that you saw in southern Europe and I could i honestly think you could you could trace the conflict in France uh the conflict between. uh the different parts of of of the the French lands that ended up being nit into one thing, the south the south which became which was the uh, the south which was the uh headquarters of the albigensians, the cathars who were one of the first big heretical sacts of medieval Christianity, the first crusade ever declared was against the Albenzians, uh, they were massacred, famously when the when the cardinal sent his troop. saying the massacre the the final holdouts, he said uh, he said, kill them all, God will know his own, which is the first kill them all god sort them out, uh, so you had more of a trade society versus northern France where you had this very quick reemergence of like warlord uh military rulers who just imposed this this purely extractive uh uh relationship with with uh subsistance and and surpluss farmers and then that you know carries on into modern European, modern French history, but anyway this is all to say, it's this medium state conflict, these these more and more powerful, more and more technologically innovative, more and more advanced societies banging into each other in a search to stand the the crisis ridden heart of their system by extracting more, because it's all they can do, and our crisis is feels different and is different to the extent that we are getting these first real uh cracks in the foundation emerging, now again, they were there the whole time, they're always there in every system, the question is to what degree are the crisis ameliorated by the continued horizon of more profit. we use technology to increase uh productivity, we use international law to create uh uh the most highly arbitraged and socially efficient manufacturing system where the people who have to where people make stuff get paid basically nothing so and then people at the other end uh can consume stuff but even with that over time it breaks up and the cracks started really accelerating almost immediately uh it's wild like marx is often uh made fun of for saying that he that there was going to be a like while he was writing in his, he honestly thought in his lifetime, but certainly very close to it, there was going to be a final world crisis capitalist - a world final crisis and infinite capitalism where capitalism goes into final death spiral, it's it's it's it's crisis-written heart pumping beyond its capacity and then giving out, but the thing is first of all, i think it is very... interesting that marks like Christ, spoke and wrote as though he believed that the uh millennium would happen in their lifetime, and I think that any real prophet thinks that way, because why else would you be so fired with prophecy, you know, like you has to be a personal stake, an imaginative stake to keep you invested, if you're that kind of a soul, if you're that much of a mind-on-fire genius is like Jesus Christ or Carl Marx, but he was right, world war one, I would say the 30, the second 30 years war, and again we'll be talking next year, early next year about the first 30 years war, uh, very excited about that, but uh, we had the second 30 years war as the capstone to capitalism and crisis, just as the first 30 years war had been the capstone to fatally uh to uh terminal feudalism, feudalism was in terminal crisis, it had been... this hybrid dog creature, this inefficient junk rack for hundreds of years after the black death, basically saved it from having to confront its contradictions, because oh yeah, this population problem we have where we can no longer get any more fucking uh, any more uh agricultural productivity out of the land than we have, we had get no more uh coins, we can get no more gold out of the earth to create specie to circulate. an economy, what are we going to do? oh, thank you, plag ships, like this is why the conspiratorial view of history can sometimes be misleading. when you look at how beneficial to the capitalist, and there were capitalists who lived in high medieval Europe, because all these systems are studded with each other, there's never just one thing, it's just what's the dominant part, and feudalism had been broken up and replaced by this tenent. farming system in most of western Europe, but surfdom was reimposed in in eastern Europe, why? because there was more fucking land, and it went along and it started to break up, its internal structures couldn't hold anymore, the fucking uh, the reformation is is a part of this, the structures of medieval society, of medieval life, the pace of medieval life was not, consent with what it was what it felt like to actually live in this more and more commercialized society, more and more commercialized, more and more abstracted society, living, people living in a system that had been designed for the the medieval pace of life, the i should say feudal pace of life, because this is no longer feudalism, but feudalism is still the overarching political structure, and so there's this massive conflugration, the 30 years war and its attended crisis. the fucking revolution in England and and all the revolts in in Naples and France, the front and fucking Spain, this massive proox, what emerges out of it is capitalism, that it breaks the feudal hold, that 17th century is when the feudal, the feudal uh, the crystalus breaks away and falls away to reveal the new uh synthesized capitalism, synthesized on a religion on a basis of... protestant religion, i know the catholicism stuck around, but it was on the losing team, it would not shape the future definition of things, protestantism would shape the future definition, why? because northern Europe was speeding up faster than southern Europe, and why? because northern Europe was more fucking environmentally uh unstable and uh uh prone to famin and uh and starvation. more scarce, that that definition, that that different speed of life is because of scarcity, increased scarcity in northern Europe led to more uh, abstracted regimes of exploitation technologically in uh the creation of a market space where you could instead of having to ritualize socially the violence of exploitation which is inefficient, you put it off onto a market, so it doesn't have to be socially costed, but we can all pretend it's not being created by the system we live in. so that means that they're actually stacking up uh surpluses in the form of cash and then in the form of uh abstract instruments of credit, that's a huge thing, and it's all part in parcel to the personalized god of protestantism that allows. shit, sorry i got, what the fuck? okay, you hear me? Okay, okay, good, um, what the fuck was I say, so capitalism sets up shot there, and it of course takes hundred or so years to achieve hegemity, through the instruments, first of the Dutch Republic and then uh, the British Empire, and it completes that job by the mid 19th century. uh about that's when you see things like the uh piping heavenly kingdom in uh China and the civil war in the United States why you see the world the fucking 48 revolutions before that this is the this is the moment when Marx was there it was the imminent the escaton of global capitalism not yet as one as a global system but as a system that could compete with other systems and and and a rastly more efficient than any of them and it would force all of their competiting states, all of them to adopt their polices. that is the moment that Marx was there for, and Marx saw at that rate, even with colonial exploitation, the competition between the states of Europe as they grew in power and grew in technological sophistication and miseration at the heart of their uh systems as they have to create more and more proletarians to work in more and more exploitative. to fuel the system, they will come to conflict, because the booman bust will eventually become unstabilizing, and he got, he was correct, like he died in what, 1881, i think, 1888, i believe, and by 1914, like and if he kept a little better care of himself, he might have made it to that old, you know, but then he wouldn't have been him, if he's out walking around, he's not. uh sitting in the British museum archives, but anyway uh, he could have been alive for that, that's within a realistic lifespan, he would have been an old man, but he could have seen it, um, and 1914 was it, it was the start of this 30 year proox as capitalism, as soon as it takes power, within 50 years comes the fatal conflict, but the reason that was not the end of capitalism is because by this point. capitalism had made all these other social formations into mirrors of itself in order to compete with them, which means that you have capitalisms outside of Europe. now Europe is where it was born, and and and Marx couldn't see this because he was a European at the end of the day and he couldn't see really, he didn't really, how could he grasp beyond that, like he could read a lot about the United States, but he never lived here uh, so he didn't know what was happening here, he didn't realize the extent to which the United States was absorbing all the social contradictions of European capitalism and resolving them through the distribution of free real estate and the exploitation of kincolor slave labor, racial cast uh and manifest destiny. these are the these are the missing ingredients that European capitalism could not provide to the center. and that means that these Europe can knock themselves out, but when it's all over, here is this new headquarters to take over from England. and take to us, take us to a stage that marks, I don't think ever imagine possible. I mean, I think he did in the long run, but he had always assumed that it would be interrupted before that could occur by the internal contradictions of capitalism undermining it, which it did. Those got contradictions were not felt the same way in the United States and the United States by that point was able to marshal a continent's worth of resources and therefore be in a material level in able to take on the role of... Europe because of their relatively similar economic power within the global system, which is mostly filled with um decaying imperial systems in in the old imperial parts of the world, the parts where there was no small state competition because there was a central imperial authority, and what made that happen according to wolfgang uh or Walter shell and I agree with him, it was the proximity to step nomads. "the chad's chad, the society that even after everything else got settled, even after the warrior kings came back and dominated the city, so they could sit fat and happy uh and decadent in their in their sedan chairs, they stayed out there, they fucking b, they they grabbed horses and they fucking domesticated them, and then they just fed them on endless grass fields and just lived as warriors and that threat kept the chinese for example uh" always focused on a emergency level crisis of imminent annihilation which meant that all you could have that meant for one thing no feudalism feudalism was abolished in China in I believe the 200s uh like after the consolidation of the first empire or after I think the fall of like the first dynasty 200 bc they're like yeah these these fucking... heads having like sovereignty over their territory in exchange for military on their terms military uh uh uh service we're not going to keep the mongols away with that bullshit get out of here whereas nobody can dominate anybody else like that in Europe nobody can take over everybody's place you know they can come and they can fight you, they can ravage your territory, but you're still going to be in charge, unless you die in the battlefield and that's a glorious death, you're not going to be uh, not going to be exterminated as as a as a social social uh fiction, which is what a a a barbarian society operating literally by different rules because of their different relationship to their environment, their different production method or the their diff different um mode of production, they're different, they're uh, like their means of production were the weapons of war and their horses, because their the all of their efforts went into being best at fighting, so that means they could go to place where people had built stuff and just take it, i'm talking to the shidle book is escape from rome. very very good book, I highly recommend, um, but but the stability led to stagnation, as someone says in the comments, uh, because you there is nothing harnessing all of these ingenious invent innovations that come when more, more minds are working, more brains are together, they're closer to, they're able to communicate closer, because you get like everything, printing revolution, you're increasing life in a uh godless world basically that took god out of the world as in the market, made the market made the market that is the world our social world a desacralized space and to bring all um religious uh conception internally, i am the god, of course they would never have said that, but no, that is what they did instead of... God, I am God, and then there is the social, which is not, it is a it is a nature. where we can do whatever we want and we can treat our fellow human as bad as we want to, because it is God's will, because if it's doing me good and I'm God, I will it, and of course for those people who thinks aren't going good for, tough shit, you're not in, you're not one of us, you're a loser, you fall out of real existence, the book again for next week, thank you for reminding me is um, the china boom why china will not rule the world by hofung hung this guy's name i also did i want to do something buy an actual chinese person i'm already i'm already a dang uh guy gen or whatever is there a chinese word is there a chinese derogatory buse guy is japanese is there a chinese derogatory term for round eyeed foreigners baizu guilo? there's i'm getting baizol i'm getting guilo and baizol i got three guilos now now i got a baizu it's neck and neck i'm getting a i'm getting a baizu for every gue means devil man that's awesome yeah it is kind of wild like think about think this is the thing about that i find very interesting about about contemporary Asia is that you had these societies like the Japanese uh and the Chinese who for very good reason believe themselves to be the center of the world like it was it was not obviously everybody thinks that they are the center of the world but they had the best case they certainly had a better case than anybody in fucking Europe the ass end of the continent I mean it wasn't as barren and resource list as a lot of people like to claim, but compared to life in in China, it was nothing, one of the big reasons that the Chinese never really did conquest discove uh exploration is because they didn't need anything, they didn't need fucking spices, and they had trade networks that allowed them to sell the stuff they did have for a stuff that they wanted, and uh, a huge trunk, a huge amount of the silver that was pulled out of... uh this the south American uh mine spy, the Hapsburgs uh went to China for silk, the Middle East also has a very good uh claim to it also because of its geographical literal centrality to that whole area, that whole nexus there, um, and so their religion reflected that, like... their their folk notions of religion that like turned into you know like that's what's so fascinating about China specifically is like you have this central uh imperial authority but then at the folk level you have basically a totally uh a a a profusion of totally unorganized uh local folk beliefs you know like you've got confusionism you've got Buddhism and Dawism they're all there but they're just very loose like rubrics. for grouping together what are essentially local spiritual phenomena, and I think those things go together, like in the west, those uh military states coming out of the collapsing Roman empire uh, require a social dimension of uh of coersion, that the Chinese system didn't need to, because it was uh, was a lightly felt hand basically at every point. um, but all of these religions had in common though is the chinese people were god, the people of God, whatever you meant by that, just as the the the Japanese Shinto traditions, and Japanese Buddhism too, they were the senters, and that meant that the you know the waybows, the guiijions, these are devil people, these are people who are not of God. like the same way the Europeans thought of the of the infidel other, but in their case, these highly developed social formations that were just as abstract, just as everybody in them was living in basically the same mental universe of of of mastery of abstract concepts uh have just these devil people show up and then take them, destroy them. It's like it's very easy to see how uh the the the samurai were broken in Japan because how could anybody believe in the old gods favor when these fucking gringos are showing up in their white ships or black ships and be like, hey, stand and deliver, oh man, what if, what if the Romans had discovered fossil fuels, holy shit, see the thing is, you can't get it, because those those sort of innovations come from basically bottlenecks of capital. emerging uh, you're getting like concentrations of money around and focus and human attention around a specific problem, and those only occur if the social structure uh is facilitating that, like the state is intervening on behalf of these things, and that is like England, one of the big things that makes them the uh, the place where the industrial revolution happened, because yes, they took over from the dutches. like the commercial headquarters of European capitalism in the late 17 17th century, but they were not able to, they were they what made them dominate everybody else in the next 200 years was the fact that they took those resources and directed them towards these industrial questions that were then a that the society existed like the liberal the liberal uh marketized society they had allowed for those um those efforts to get immediate reward in the form of patents uh and money incentivizing the best minds to get to this specific question because otherwise everyone's going to be going towards their own drummer, we're going to get somewhere, but it's not going to be efficient. what capitalism does is allows the state to say, put money here, put money here, put money here towards the creation of specific technological breakthroughs in order to compete more effectively. and the British uh industrial revolution, the first industrial revolution is tied directly to the British war effort during the Napoleonic Wars, it was the it was fighting Napoleon that gave the uh the British political system sufficient incentive to uh facilitate, deregulate, subsidize the... construction of technology first of war, but then of course other applications around war, but war is like the health of the state, war is what makes the state, and then the state makes war, as Charles Stilly said, that's that's correct, but every time it does so it creates greater and major technology, which then is directed to the common use under capitalism by being privatized, now this is social, this is a social product, but it is privatized because of our fantasy ritual world that we live in, that is was consecrated really in the Roman ethos, like capitalism is just the roman conception of right property, the roman world, the roman, eye, among all the competing social structures that existed at that point, the Romans were the first, to codify the the values of a s, the values of a society in the conditions of crisis capitalism, or i'm sorry, crisis class rule, in in Europe, it is the European geography that makes it unconquerable after Rome falls, but Rome's operating system. basically is never overthrown, it is incorporated, the texts of the uh, the church maintains the structure that that exists of the Roman empire, the church hierarchy is where the the Roman empire retreats basically, and then marshall and then like military authority is devolved to warlord, chieftins, lumberds and fucking Franks, organized into uh social structures dominated from the from the from the middle that can extend their power as far as possible and so you get the holy Roman empire which almostly breaks into pieces because the German part can't hold because it is geographically too unbound it's unbound the way that france France is bound to shit they call it the hexagon has five almost perfect natural borders like either rivers or oceans or the or the piranes and just like uh, but it's Italy is a peninsula, England is an island, Germany is just this, it's this rivers, it's these river systems, it's these civilizations along the rine or the danue, it cannot be taken from a middle like that France can be from Paris or England can be from London, to this day, you go to Germany, there is no big city, there is no, you might think Berlin is like... Ohio is the Germany of the United States because Ohio does not have one big city like Milwai or it has columbusnati, cleveland, then even second run cities uh like and toledo which are like dusseldorf, and uh, yeah, it's a bunch of milwakis, i guess clevelands, that is the thing that's annoying those because wisconsin should be the Germany. the United States, it's got, I would argue the most, it's the most German influenced state. Uh, and I think the fact that they had the socialist mayors, that they were able to actually take power municipally, as proof of that, because that was the current of German emmer Gray life, the people who left Germany did so because capitalism had fuck them raw, and so they came to America and tried to set it right, instead of just trying to make it. their own like every other fucking card sharp and irishman came to these shores. okay, 14 million people in the London Metro area, still, not as many as i thought, but nonetheless, only two billion in Berlin, but sadly Wisconsin just has to Milwaque, it's got Madison, but like that just the shape of or why is even kind of shaped like Germany, okay, six mil. metro in Berlin, that's $10 million, four million, and so that that's what that's the machine that took over the world basically, and we're at the end of it, we our our simulated computer world that is is supported not by uh, any kind of ritually consecrated human endeavor, but by the uh unthinking, uh, totally alienated, unconnected to human life, decision, cold decisions of algorithms. Ah, the sound is fucked, goddamn, I really felt like I was on a roll here, but all right, I'm gonna just avoid, whatever, I'm fine. but now we're in a situation where there is nobody else to pick up the slack, and I think what happens then is we look backward and we're like, okay, yes, we can say that we have a globalize capitalism, but as I said before every system has embedded within it remnants, undigested remnance of what came before, so like there were capitalists in uh the Roman empire even though there wasn't the capitalism, there were capitalist in every society, there there was protocapitalism in the uh, the um the muslim world in the middle in the middle ages, and also once capitalism emerges, those old systems still remain in some some remnant form, you know, like uh, there are still artisans out there. and so that means that if if the supply chain breaks the way the Romans did, we're left with the same thing that was the Romans were left with. local power persists, but at the edges, it frays into uh, essentially lawlessness in some respect, and so we go back to the the the Roman emperial system with localized trading routes protected by local structures of power that are then going to negotiate through these uh whoever is able to command these out uh the well that's the thing that's the difference so after the Roman empire collapsed right the local trade networks the local power structures existed in the cities in the south and then it collapsed more fully in the north which is where um the military aristocracy involves to fight other people for land rather than to cultivate and trade it the way that they were doing. in the places that had kept things and they eventually overthrew and dominated and created uh feudalism, which is in a respect is a progress from the slave society that preceded it. because hey, at least it's not slaves. you don't own your person, you just are, you are required to give them labor as tribute, tributary relationship, so if we take that analogy to the current moment, who is going to be that uh, that force outside, and here's the most pressing question, has technology progressed so much since that time? that the walls of the trade networks are going to be essentially impregnable and so you will have people fighting for the scraps in the exclusion zones where the the the trade networks break down and where. social base for this thing is going to be decaying rapidly, people are going to be getting spit out the bottom like nobody's business, but much of its operation will be automated, drones, cameras, boston dynamics robots, simple geography, proximity, the creation of inaccessible at tols of wealth that then direct the the remaining people were getting just enough to stay on the treadm, man somebody's asking if me and Chris would go to any raves or festivals is coming here, Chris and uh and his wife Molly are uh big time uh ravers and festival heads, their music heads power excellents and I respect them and their uh beliefs very much, but I am not much of one of those kind, standing up that long is a hassle, my back hurts - I guess sweaty, but uh we did go to the club, we went to like the... club, the club type scenario in Miami, and that was very fun, so I'd be willing to go, I'd be willing to uh to try out a fest, I mean we did go to uh pitch or not pitchwork, uh, Picathon and that was great, I don't know if I could handle a a rave though, seems really loud. Yeah, we went to Club Space, it's called, it was weird, it was called Club Space, but it had sort of like a uh, a autumnal like forest vibe, I don't know if that was for Halloween or something, but felt like we were in like the ewawk village or and there was like, why is it called Club Space? Maybe that's it, maybe it's zew village in space. Yeah, I would need air plugs, I only got one air so I have to protect it. I don't have anybody knows that I'm half deaf. I have to say though, being have to have. That's one of those situations where uh, it really is, it seems like it's all or nothing, because I technically cannot hear it all out of one of my ears, which means I'm half deaf, but man, I still can hear a lot of stuff, and when I think when I see deaf people, I was like, damn, they can't hear anything, and I can still hear a lot of stuff, 50%, it's uh, it's okay. but I do think eventually those batteries are going to run out, the the the robots are going to get tired of chasing around in circle, and then whatever has whatever, whatever people have done to survive in that exclusion zone uh is going to become a stable uh, viable social formation. and it will eventually be able to push open those gates, unplug the uh the dumb ass corpses from the computers from these idiots who like try to plug themselves, at the end of it that it'll be armies of human liberation marching into deserted uh uh compounds and finding some rich dickhead who looks like fucking king tot shriveled ass like with a with like a fucking uh like a usb chord coming out of a spinal cord spinal column and into like a fucking uh macbook and you open the computer and there's just like an eight bit guy just going bp blorp and the hope in every human breast that has to be there. has to be there is that those people will be able to synthesize everything that come before them as those people before them did, but having come to this point where conceptions of humanity extend to all of humans. i know we like to think that oh everyone's racist now and fascism is back and nationalism is horrible, but the violence of those systems is the rebellion against the deeper truth that cannot be renounced, which is oh shit, we are all one thing, fuck. but so class society can't have that so it has to be suppressed, i mean i don't have to sell you on the future thing, it's gonna happen or not, you you just you have to make decisions about what you're gonna do with it. and maybe they don't, maybe they don't figure out, maybe they're worse, maybe they're worse than everybody, and then they they they dig up the nukes and they destroy earth completely, uh, okay, still, 100,0 years in the future after that, 200,000, got some fucking, that's right, some fucking squid guys, some fucking squid creatures. who have come to land and are able to use their encounters with our artifacts to uh harness technology to the social being to to negate the the cancerous uh conflict-based uh algorithm at the... center of our of our social identities that's been passed on since the fucking Romans. All right, I think that was good, I've gone pretty long, so next week we're going to read the first half of the China boom, it's like 60 pages, it's nothing, it's going to goes through like everything until. 20 2000 so i'm expecting a very breazy jant through political economy of early modern China, which is exactly what I want. as I said, if there's something really interesting specifically I want to get more into, uh, find another, another book, but I think this is a good entry point, the book is the China boom, why China will not rule the world, by haung i believe, his name, hofan the hung, that's it. All right, talk to y'all on the flippity flop.
