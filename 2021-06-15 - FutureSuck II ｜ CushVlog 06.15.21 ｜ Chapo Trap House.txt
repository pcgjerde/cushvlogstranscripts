 they blasted and dug with their sweat and their guts, they never drank water but whiskey by pints and the shanty towns rang with their songs and their fights, navigator, navigator, rise up and be strong, the morning is here and there's work to be done, get your pick and your shovel and them all dynamite, where to shift a few tons of of this earthly delight, yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight, they died in their hundreds with no sign to mark where, save the brass in the pocket of the entrepreneur by rub slides and rock blast, they got buried so deep. but if death if not life they'll have peace while they sleep, navigator, navigator, rise up and be struck, the morning is here and there's work to be done, take your ticken, your shovel and them all dynamite. to shift a few tons of this earthly delight, yes, to shift a few tons of this earthly delight, the mark on this land is still seen and still laid, a way for a commerce where vast fortunes were made. some loyal to an empire where the sun never set, which is now deep in darkness, but the railways there yet, navigator, navigator, rise up and be strong, the morning is here and there's work to be done, take your pick and your shovel and them all dynamite, we're to shift a few tons of this earthly. delight, yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight, one of my favorite songs, navigator as covered by the pogs, that's not a pog's original, uh, like uh, band says, band uh, the band played walsing matilda also a cover, two of their best songs were covers, but that it just shows the breath of your musicality in a way, that you can get a... you can make the definitive version of something. somebody asked if panda express is good, and you know what, I wouldn't have been qualified to answer that until a couple weeks ago, I just uh, the last couple weeks I found myself by happen stance going into panda expresses, not in malls, which I honestly before this month didn't think was a thing. I thought panda express was exclusively available in malls that there weren't any stand alones and now two times. in the last month I found myself in a situation where i needed to eat something on the run and I'm in a car and oh there's Panda Express and I've gone twice now I've had the I had the the Beijing beef uh one time the bowl and the other time I had um I think the garlic pepper chicken and I have to say pretty good and I realize at least this is my theory. i don't know if it's true that the reason that um panda express now, i really feel like this is new, now has these um standalone locations, because i swear to god, i swear to god, i never saw panda express outside of a mall before, and since i don't go to malls as habit, as a matter of course, i kind of thought, well never going to have panda express again, and then boom, they're out there, and my theory about it, this might it's totally made up by me, theoretical style is that it is the market. responding to the creation of the chipotle level of like ethnic food delivery, like chipotle invented a new way to get a uh etnic cuisine right, in a way that was like rationalized and standardized and homogenized for suburban palette, that it existed at the end of fast food like taco bell, but it had not existed at the level of uh the the attainable uh like upmarket faster food, the the area for the more well-healed among the the middle class who buys things and goes to make uh restaurants that you can that are a sufficient in number. to make a business, to make to make an industry, they created, they found this sector of of people with a little more money in their hands and yes, subway was the first of this, but it was really an outlier and really ahead of its time, it was, and also you know, the sub is sort of a different thing, they kind of invented something there, but so chipolis is this new type of consumer experience for the people want to gesture towards like urban sophistication that higher pricepointed food offerings represent, but live in the context of economically and and geographically in like a suburban milieu. attainable urbanity, attainable bohemianism, and that created a new market really, because people found out, oh there's money here, and so now you have a bunch of attempts to do that for different foods, pizza has two. what if you could do that with pizza? what if you can make pizza bespoke enough to transcend like a hot and ready or a fucking a day class say $5 hot and ready from uh little caesars but is it like a brick mortar neapolitan place that's more expensive it's the new era and so that's going to come for every uh type of food and Maybe Panda Express saw the spot and went for it sort of the way that blockbuster could have been could have evolved into the streaming platform that we all use for movies but they fucked up like they had the slot and there was even the awareness that it was a reality and there was a desire within the company to move in that direction but they were too more poorly managed to handle it and so Pand Express is sort of does the anti-blockbuster. and slides in there, hey panda express, here it is, machine level uh uh uh chinese food but presented and the thing is it is presented like it wasn't in the this is a rebrand all along you have to remember this because the original panda express play really was taco bell for mexican for us chinese food it was declasses but i tell you guys these two ones i've gone to they are chipotle to the level to level they're absolutely trying to be that and uh it's It's tasty, it's not bad, but I again i just made that off, I have no idea, so you're saying that these are not new, and it's always been that way, I guess that's just the spot that Panda Express has been sitting in, it's been in the cut waiting to to come to life, sounded, it was fine, it is, it's about as good as that level of thing, so that is to say pan express is not bad. the Beijing beef was pretty good, I got to say, you could build a bowl with the different type of things, they have like six different versions, and you can go with lomen or fried rice as a base, so yeah, pan express is fine, it's like chipotle, yeah, chipotle is not great if there are better options you should take them, but if you want a burrito and you're like getting uh gas, you know, or doing erronds, you could do worse, that's for sure, look at all those emotes. there are no bodegas in la, there are 7-elevens and I got to say I'm with Matt Burning on this, 7-eleven is superior to the bodega in every way, it is the highest level of Bodega, yes I do have Wisconsin I taste, I always have. I like ketchup, I like ketchup on uh, I like ketchup on mac and cheese, like a fucking Canadian, I'll admit it. Yes, there is no chumped cheese at 7-eleven, but they do have a lot of other great options, they've got decent pizza, little thin slice or the thin crust, they've got those little uh, kind of uh egg rolls with the exotic flavors in them, and they got slushies, whereas what does the bodega have? chomped cheese and the dustiest sandwiches you've ever had. Yes, spodegas have atmosphere and they better because that's what you're paying for living in a city with Bodegas, that's how... That's the that's what makes it all worthwhile is that is that exotic touch to make you feel sophisticated, that is, that's that's the value you get from the budega experience. The writing is coming pretty well, the interviews that are going to form the basic. of the book have been completed and now I'm going to edit them, shape the language, add stuff and turn it into something uh legible, so that's the the final sort of writing by editing process is coming up and I'm excited, you also get a lot of uh convenience that way with the bodegas, because if you live in New York, you're never more than about a block away from a bodega. most neighborhoods, so that's not necessarily true of seven is 11 in uh other parts of the country, because you know they can only compete against each other so much. i went to a quick trip when i was in Wisconsin visiting my parents, and i've got to say they have definitely risen to the challenge of the 7-eleven food experience, because they don't just have the... uh the case of uh summer sausage and cheese curds that they used to have, now they've got a whole prepared meal section with their own pizza and their own little nuggets and and hot dogs and shit, all prepared and and arranged very much like a 7-eleven, apparently those uh those upgrades were very expensive for 7-eleven uh owner operators because it operates on a franchise model. but 7-eleven has this contract where they're they dictate to their franchise what they have to keep in their store to say to keep their license is a 7-eleven so they have to say like to be in a 7-eleven you have to provide x y and z like as part of your uh your arrangement and now their contracts are requiring them to keep these food items in there even though it's very expensive to maintain a uh a essentially restaurant inside something that's supposed to be a convenience store. uh and so it's it's actually a a loss for a lot of these franchises, but they have to pay that basically to keep the franchise, and so it's led to this really grim and and honestly illustrative phenomenon where the mostly immigrant owners of 7:11 who were brought into like their franchise relationship by a concerted effort by 7-eleven to reach out to the south indian south asian community specifically and say hey "you want to come to this country, here's an opportunity, you don't have to worry about if your engineering degree is going to be able to get you a a a similar job to that in the United States, you know, you don't have to worry about maybe having to drive a cab, if you can own your own business, and there's like there's networks that created this, and now they're imposing all these requirements on the 7-elevens that are making it, making the margins so thin for the operators, meanwhile 7-eleven is just getting the franchise fees, you know, and getting the profit." uh is that they're essentially working for like 20th grand a year, like they have been fully proletarianized, and they're hyper exploiting their own time too, they've been even though they're they're members of the petty bourgeois, like they are the yoman hold out because of their position, their vulnerable position as immigrants largely, like 7-eleven would, if they kicked up a fuss about this stuff, 7-eleven six ice on them. like they literally collaborate with the state to ring uh bargaining power away from these owner operators, so now quick trip is becoming like that, this this local mainstate is becoming like that, you know, it's uh, it shows that everything, every every uh sort of social construction short of socialism that you try to build to damn a the uh the power of capital to just proletarianize everybody, including people are hold a stake in capitalism like the petty bourgeois, you could steam roll them, because there's nothing they could build that can resist it, so we had this American idea of the yoman smallholder, first of land, then of some sort of business as a bollwork against the the condition of proletarian, which is what you're trying to avoid, and if you think a system will help you avoid proletarization, you will engage with it, enthusiastically. but then that relationship changes as the pressure of capital accumulates. the the the drop of profit, the rise of of the liquidation of of all classes save owner and provider of labor, and that means a lot of people in the middle sector are not going to be brought up and bought into this new ruling power, they're going to fall out of it, they're going to fall out of the middle section into proletarianization, and that is the... position of the American middle class that makes up whatever kind of reactionary formation around trump you want to talk about. And it is a resistance of proletarization by this middle strata of people who are participators and beneficiaries of the American capitalist order and so what look like uh looks like a battle between like some left and... right between some working class and and the ruling class is really just this uh this cultural battle waged between people on different sides of this equation as the thing falls apart so you've got this uh the last remaining believers in capitalism right are your let liberal media class and the media people that they create and the culture that they create. those are the last people who really believe in capitalism because they believe that even under fully uh fully uh proletarianized hypercapitalism that they will be on the winning end of it, that they will have reached a position within capitalism, well they will be a a a rentiere and not a laborer, a eloy, not a morloch, and that's because they believe at a at a level of of um a deep uh uh existential conviction that their talents, because these are the last meritocrats, that their talents will earn them a spot away from the conditions of exploitation that make up being a proletarian, or a member of the reserve army of labor, the totally destroyed and cast down - lumpion that is created inevitably by the system, there's no... that you're not even going to just you're not that you're even going to be able to work with your hands or work uh or exploit your time, you might not be given any reason to exist in this system and have to fucking scroung for yourself in what are essentially post-apocalyptic conditions like when we talk about the capitalism being unevenly distributed so is the apocalypse the apocalypse as we imagine it in our mind post-nuclear apocalypse the the global warming idea apocalypse that it came after the cold war, vision of exstatic extinguishment was gone, that vision exists for those who are no longer of use to capitalism and who cannot sell their labor, in the global south, but in the in this city, a block from where I stand, the apocalypse is here, for those who have reached that condition within capitalism, and we've reached a point where the war, the culture battle is between those people who think that when that time comes, they will be inside the house, not outside, and for our lump and bourgeois that make up the Trump base, the the the haron volk democratic, the fascist, whatever you want to call it base, of of populist nationalism, those people believe that when the time comes, given the current arrangement of capitalism, they will in fact be consumed and extruded and cast out into the apocalypse, a post-industrial post, a post industrial world of total pollution, scarcity and breakdown of basic uh protections of law, and contract, and on the other side of that, the the good guys from a cultural perspective, because they uphold pluralism, they uphold the notions of like universal humanity that we need to survive as a species, they have that going for them, but it is on top of a belief that these things can only be advanced by capitalism. an embedded understanding that only capitalism can sustain this, and so that means that on the other end of that you have the people, the meritocrats, in addition to the people who are just so wealthy that they know that they already own, they already own the means of production, it doesn't matter, it's in their hip pocket, this is all just a game to them, but like that tenuous class, the academic elite, the media class, the people who make up the conversation that we're all participating in and that makes... our understanding of the fucking like the terrain of the country we live in, because we don't know what's going on in the country, we don't know what's going on in the world, we echo locate through an engagement with the culture that is made by this class of people, the last believers in capitalism, because they think that their talents, either, their labor talents or if they've deluted themselves into thinking that they're part of a uh, a political project that will bring about peaceful socialism from within capitalism, those because you can't discount that, there are plenty of totally uh uh earnest comrades who had here to capitalism at a subconscious level, at a faith level because they think... not that oh, it doesn't matter, I'll be a winner, I'll be, I'll be a holder of uh capital, they think, no, my political project that I'm going to be part of is going to eventually overtake capitalism, and so everyone will be in the tent, and so my participation in capitalism in the here and now is justified, and those that those people are battling on a cultural firmament, but at the basic the the machine. is operating independently of the political engagement, because we have detached from class, because our politics is purely a representation of our understanding of the world, which is the simulacrum, which is the this cultural fake world, the the world where where uh the the destiny of the nation is on whether or not we accept critical race theory, whether or not that is going to determine whether capitalism lives or dies, it's not, it is a it is a delusional participation, it is a, it is a performance by a class of people who think that they're going to be okay one way or the other, and so they can articulate a politics that is based on capitalism and is assumes without any metaphysical question that it cannot be overtaken. and that is why the politics as we currently have it is sterile and doomed, why it doesn't matter whether if they ban CRT from schools, or if they if they ban uh, any kind of abolism in any entertainment uh and make critical, like you can ban critical race theory in schools, but that will only make critical race theory mandatory in the culture, so there is no way anyone can win this battle, because things are going to keep getting worse, at the level of law, the places where Republicans rule, are going to use the law to stamp out, the ability to express left-wing political ideals, critical race, oh racial consciousness that can transcend the racial apartide structure of American social life, you uh, that you will... somehow stop the drift of culture cuuse that's what you're actually participating in towards uh the sort of mongolized culture you're afraid of guess what you're only making it inevitable because if you make CRT illegal in schools you will make it mandatory in cultural production now they're not going to use laws to make it mandatory they're just going to use the market in the form of what people will pay for, what media platforms will pay to have produced that is going to that market, that invisible hand is going to determine the actual market is going to determine that you cannot anything made or consumed widely within the culture, unless it fully makes, if it makes race and racism the central and foundational message, purpose for being of it, forget art, there is no aesthetic question here, we are only going to ask the... question of does this perform a political act of being anti-racist and those dynamics will inflame each other and ratchet each other up and drive us towards civil conflict, but the engine of that will be a imiserating social context of hypercapitalism overtaking everything and casting everyone out of any position of safety into full precariity, but that's not going to and that's not going to be um addressed by any of these either cultural or political fights, because they're independent of capitalism, all right, so this was supposed to be the episode where i talked about uh red plenty, or no red plenty, we should talk about that book, actually, it's fascinating, Francis Spafer, it's a historical novel about - the... Soviet attempt to solve the riddle of price point of of the price mechanism, how to reproduce technologically the um the price signal, that was the that was... what the soviets actually tried to do under Krushchev and presnev, they they tried to create a command consumer economy by and having the efficiency of the market reproduced cybernetically, and that is the challenge of socialism, that is the fundamental challenge of socialism, because when you talk about the uh about the working class seasing control of capitalism, at a point when its conditions of uh capital accumulation have created the necessary technological capacity to distribute labor outputs rationally and not through the market, and you can say that one of the reasons the Soviet Union failed is because we hadn't reached that point yet, a point that Marx was probably too optimistic in his own understanding, he underestimated the degree to which technology could put off the end of capitalism, the technology could smooth things out. socially enough to allow capitalism to sustain itself, to buy off revolution, essentially, he underestimated its capacity to do that, that's not his fault, that is something he could not have known, that is one of those unknown knowns that that that's the ignorance that you like have to revolve around, it's the fucking it's the black hole at the center of the universe of our understanding of the world, is this unnowable future, and that's what every one of our understandings is built on, and so marx built this perfect, i think framework for understanding capitalism as as an as an economy and as a politics, as a culture, as an as a reality, but he as with anything you can either know momentum or um speed, you can't know both, there is a great unknown known, and for Marx, it was technology and the technological capacity to create um to ease to uh distribute rationally. resources, by which I mean to keep the host alive and not kill it. rational distribution, and rational distribution happened at the center of capitalism because of imperialism, because the hyper exploitation of the global south allowed for a rational distribution of resources at the center of production where capitalism was most vulnerable away from crisis, and that was buying off the working class, that is why America became this the... headquarters of capitalism, it's why the German revolutions of 1918 and 1920 failed, because at the center of capitalism, rational distribution had been culturally facilitated, and it spreads through the system, but at the level of the hyper exploited uh um uh end point of capital accumulation, the colonies, you have just pure uh savagery, you have, you have, you have no room for a social heart to beat, you have the cold steel, you have the whip of the slave owner, you have the the sneer of cold command of the slave owning aristocracy, the old junkers, and that meant that when the great crisis of capitalism finally came in the early 20th century, the capitalism marks had been predicting and was correct in his understanding of about when it would happen, the technology had existed long enough to distribute rationally at the center of capitalism, sufficient adherence to capitalism among the working class that there was at the time of crisis there was no one there to fight when the real moment came, because you can forgive the social democrats in Germany for example, for voting for war credits, because they assume like everybody that it world war One would be like every previous uh European war since the uh end of the Napoleonic era, since the council of uh uh, since the the the council of Vienna, short, one season long affairs, bun bloody nose in a treaty, they were all assuming that, they shouldn't if that was insane, but it was underming their logic, because you go by, when you're trying to make a decision, you go by what had happened in the past, that's one of the fundamental things that is going to doomus as a species. so you can forgive them for that, public opinion was patriotic, even among workers, because the system had been rewarding them, it had been giving them better lives, it had been giving them political control, it had been distributing the the the the surpluss of capitalism rationally and away from just the market hoovering it up towards uh in profits towards ownership. and that meant that sure they voted for war credits, but then in 1918, after four years of the most horrifying war anyone had seen since the 30 fucking years war, but on a mechanical proportions that leaves the the cream of the German working class, the French working class, the British working class dead in in a field at each other's hands. The working class of Europe had committed. suicide at the pest of their rulers, but in that moment, the working class of the the remainder of the working class of Europe turned towards their leaders, turned to upward and said, holy shit, how did you let this happen, and that crisis came all across Europe, but the only place that it broke towards revolution was the place where the working class was the smallest, and where these spoils of capitalism had been distributed. and so it snapped, the system snapped in half, and and the incohate working masses of the Russian cities were able to see power, now if that had been the extent of it, if they known that had been the extent of it, there's a real question of whether they would the bolscheviks would have gone on and carried out the revolution, because an isolated Russian revolution was going to die, every single person among the leadership of the bolshevic party, and I would say the majority of the people at the leadership levels within the Soviets themselves, among the workers and sailors and and soldiers, was that they were going to spark a world revolution. The questions of the Soviet Union that left all the blood on the hands of socialism and tarnished marxism, we're all made in a context of what do we do now? You could argue they made the wrong call. You could argue that the one guy who knew what to do was Bukaren who said this is failed that means that we have to step back and let the bourgeois do the job of building capitalism to the sufficient point that we can seize it because we're not there yet. We have to admit that climb down, buy off the peasants. Buy them off. Create a more rational distribution of resources. through central planning, but through through like a a collaborative effort of a of a party that comes from the working class, but introduce capitalism and buy, buy us back into the system as it exists so that the moment of crisis can come and we'll be better prepared for it, instead of yoaking ourselves to a monstrous project of hyper exploiting the the peasant class, turning it into a proletarian. at the cost of millions of lives, which is what happens everywhere the capitalism is introduced, but doing it under communist, would that be worth doing, and they would have say though, maybe now it isn't, if they if they asked themselves honestly, they might have said that wouldn't be worth it, but they made the choice that they made, and we all had to fight the fight, we we had to war with the armies we had, but the reason they got to that point is because they believe there were going to be a world revolution, and there is god dammit, there was going to be one, in some universe there was one, when the keil mutaneers refused to let the fucking suicidal junker psychopaths, these crouch samur of the royal of the german high command, sail the fucking baltic fleet out in a suicide mission to be destroyed in honorable combat by the British navy doing massive sapuku, they didn't want to do it because it wasn't their fucking war and it's... a revolution that if it had been yoked to the project in Russia could have created a a genuine conflict at a point of of fluidity with a capitalism that might have been disorganized enough and weakened enough to be challenged by it and why didn't it happen because in Germany because that's one of the places that capitalism had develop first its flesh was most robust its tendrals into the... working class were the strongest, and that when the moment came, the majority of the German Social democratic party, both rank and file, but definitely among the the union and political leadership of the of the party itself, were aligned with capitalism at a material level, because it had benefited them, and so the free core, the the brainfrieed death worshipping psychos who had been turned into orks essentially by contact with industrial warfare were organized and let loose by the social democrats to stamp down "the world revolution, which was what anybody with eyes could see should have known was the moment, the apocalyptic moment that that marxism was premised upon, and so the soviets challenge that it failed to meet after the uh end of the the world war, after we failed to turn the world war into a class war, after we offered a a a after they offered a truce with the United States and allowed them to build a world economic structure that they would be excluded from where the US dollar would be the reserve currency of earth where they would have to participate in capitalism in extraction of surplus value for the market in order to sustain themselves in the state competition system that they had agreed to after World War II instead of extending uh the war into... a new phase, which you could argue is Stalin's greatest crime, is in that moment turning towards cowardly self-preservation, and you could say he might have lost, but we lost anyway, here's the important thing to note, we lost anyway, and of course you can't blame these people for not having this knowledge to not at the time, they did what they did because they didn't know, but we have to recognize it now, that is the whole point of history is to recognize in the now where our opportunities lie so that we don't let that happen to us, because if Stalin had built up that industrial beheemeth, turned that working, turned the the the clay, the the potato sack of the Russian peasantry into the beautiful uh uh twice baked potato... of uh of the five year plan in industrial Russia allied with uh workers movements all throughout the world that were essentially appendages of them at that point and putting down the fascist beast in a climate before the uh before the uh before the creation of um like the the abom on a massive scale would have fully tipped the balance. Maybe you could fight a war with capitalism and win, but if you don't fight it, my god, what was it all for, it was to save your fucking ass, disgusting, honestly disgusting, Stalin's greatest crime, buse all the other ones would have been redeemed if he made the right choice in that moment, the choice that Tito wanted to make, which is the basis of Tito's split with the Warsaw pact is that when the um, when the civil war Greece broke out and there was a real contest for power between the the Greek partisan communists and the reactionary monarchists back by the British, Stalin decided to trade Greece for the iron Kurt and sell out the greek communists and Tito said, if you do that then this is all for nothing, because we will not be able to contest capitalist. in in the context of the market on their terms, they will eat us, they will dissolve us, and stolen, because he was scared said, we're done, and of course you could say, but they would have lost anyway, you have to, the blood on your hands has to compel you to something beyond your own disgusting self-preservation, but anyway, people are people. and the system of a bolshevic party in power, absent a world revolution was going to mean Stalin was going to, a figure like Stalin was was guaranteed to take power, and by that I mean is the bolschevic party was a vanguard, illegal party, and this is the important part, it was an illegal party that operated through the vast majority of its time, as an illegal enity in Russia, where it's leadership was largely... uh exiled at either exiled internally to uh towns in Siberia where they frequently escape from or in exile in western capitals where its activities within Russia were banned, its newspapers were banned, it operated as a criminal enterprise so that it could be at the moment sees power, and they did it, and they did it on the right context, and I'll tell you right now, Lenin is the great genius of all time because Lenin was right at every moment. until he until, but the thing is, he died at the moment where we never had to find out, we died at the moment with Lenin where we don't have to find out. but Lenin was perfectly suited to seizing power with that going to war with the army he had, he, but his assumption that seasing power in Russia was worth doing was premised on the idea that it would launch a world revolution. It was all premised on that underlying assumption that Tratski had conceived of the permanent revolution. That is what solved the riddle of how to move forward in a context where marxism couldn't really be applied to a system where there was no. is that none of these ruling parties, none of the ruling classes of any of the European powers, save maybe the dutch, the ones started all. wanted capitalism to triumph, wanted things to change the way capitalism made them change, wanted to move power away from central hierarchical authority and towards a ritual of social afirmation, but they had to do it because they were in competition with each other, and capitalism provided a superior mechanism for wielding state power, by rationalizing the distribution of resources of the state away towards private profit and towards socially uh advantageous uh uh mechanisms of governance. they did it buse they had to the junkers of Germany didn't want to fucking create capitalism you think bismark wanted to fucking legalize the socialists he had to do you think the tory weirds of uh of England, those those those, those bewigged freaks out in their fucking chalets doing horrifying sex crimes to each other, looking out on their fast acages, do you think that they really wanted to fucking be cheek to jowel with a bunch of uh of foreigners and Jews in the city using little tokens to make fake fake value? you think they wanted to do something as unhonorable as that as dishonorable as as determining value in a way beyond? and and conquest on the battlefield, no, they had to, because the French were doing it, and the Spanish were doing it, and everybody was doing it, and they were fueling it with the spoils of empire and conquest in the new world, and the hyper exploitation at the point of the spear of imperial capitalism, allowed them to distribute profits socially, because capitalism gave them up to equalize the system. Look at Russia, the Russian Revolution was essentially pre-ordained by the fact that the uh the absolutism of like feudal rule was so recently intact at the top of the social order in the form of the zar that instead of facilitating capitalist development in Russia like the royal houses of western Europe are doing, the fucking romanovs were sticking a goddamn uh, they were they were shoving a stick into the spokes of the thing the entire time, because capitalism had been thrown up in the lap of the of a of a medieval order. meanwhile, in England, the the country that develops capitalism at at the point of like the cerebrum where it's brain is stored. their royal family was literally brought in, was essentially hired for the job of being the royal family of England by a uh a um by the emergent merchant class of England, like the glorious revolution of 1688 where the last vestiges of land-based rule in the form of the in the form of the Stewart line, the Jacobite line, the the Catholic Stewarts of England was overthrown by the by the new emergent merchant class of England, which had first overthrown the Stewarts before we're unable to form a social basis around capitalism that early and therefore brought the Stewarts back, but once Stewart absolutism reasserted itself. they essentially fired their CEO and hired a new guy, someone from the place where capitalism had been birthed in the modern era, the fucking Dutch Lowlens. by importing a a a constitutional monarch into the system with the understanding that his job was to go to parades and wave at people, and so capitalism in England is presidented over by this machine that is designed to lubricate the system, a parliamentary system that just throws water under the gears to keep it from smoking, keeps the friction to a minimum by distributing rationally as In Russia, medieval absolutism shows up, is forced by competition with Europe to sustain capitalism, to to indulge the whims of Sergey Vitta and Peter Stilepin, but at the end of the day it has to reassert itself, and and defectlessness of of of Nicholas where he goes back and forth between liberalizing and and and going reactionary, is always has to be understood as him having a natural inclination towards reaction, being forced by circumstances to give in, but then putting the lid on as soon as he can, until he can't anymore, which is what happens when World War II blows the whole thing up, but in every other system in Europe, every other monarchy in Europe, there have been sufficient infusion of capitalism, capitalism had been around long enough to infuse itself within the mechanisms of power that those ruling classes could preside over a system that allowed for more rational distribution, so even the keizerite which was slow on the uptake, bismark, genius of geniuses, one of those 19th century geniuses, like uh, like marx, honestly, like some sort of a a a revisionist marx. in in in the highest level of power you could almost put him as like a guy understands we need to keep civilization alive here because we cannot allow these two things this this uh this system of absolute power held by a small minority with capitalism ripping people towards a level of total sub submission to it of of enslavery and throld them to it which created social reaction that's the thing that matters. is that as you create misery, as you create proletarization, you create a reaction, you create social formations, alienated from the system, willing to fight against it, and capitalism cannot deal with that, because capitalism can only extract maximally, it is those middle people within all classes, who can do it by creating politics and marks and brismark was able to... look at the system and understand that there needed to be a rationalized buy in of these workers if they were going to sustain the state project of the German Empire and so that's why the uh one two punch what did he do during during the 18 80s what did Bismark do to the uh to the emergence of capitalism as a fully formed system that was going to be undergirding the the economies of all the European powers and was going to determine the the uh conditions of conflict between states: okay, state, state conflict had been the rule since West Feilia, but now it's state conflict under the conditions of universally applicable capitalism. What do you do? Every leader at the every level of power, both private and public in the western world had answer that question in about the 1880s, and the answer was determined by where there were the technological, the combination of technological uh efficiency and extraction of... uh colonial plunder that allowed you to buy off the moment of of reckoning and allow you to compete now in the interstate conflict and bismark said what do we do we legalize the socialists we we let them vote for socialist we let socialist serve we let them get essentially turned into bourgeois everybody at the now that you you you validated the the working class you've created new jobs for the working class that are no longer working class jobs in that they are no longer uh connected to the uh process of extraction of surplus value, they are now there to facilitate capitalism and that's a cushy job, you're you are no longer feeling, you're of course still exploited with capitalism, but it's now a mixed condition, and you don't feel exploited, you feel rewarded, you feel that you are the beneficiary of alienation at a material level because you are, and then you have to rationalize it one way or another, but it is to your condition now, and that buts you invested in capitalism, it makes you invested in the perpetuation of a system that has allowed you to feel this comfort, so now you believe not a conflict that will see you. annihilated, you believe in a conflict that will see you victorious over time because of how fucking smart and virtuous you are, and that's how the smart and virtuous rule leaders of the S uh DP, by the time world war one rules around vote for war credits, and then when the crucial moment comes in 1918, they fucking bring fascism to life, they perform a fucking dark ritual and bring the free core into existence, which will then be the the the the needle point end of the speer. and uh some degree of like social cohesion and outside resources from the exploited half of the world and the exploited half of the equation, both within the country and outside of it, and so that means that the challenge of the Krushchevs after Stalin bitches out at the moment of of truth and puts us on a conflict of uh of where we're we're assuming capitalism is the conditions, then you have to create a consumer society, you have to buy off your own working class, because Yes, things were provided universally within Germany, Russia, in a way that they were in the United States, but comforts and pleasures of a consumer society were not there, not in the same amounts, the bounty wasn't there, and it's because there were less, there's less to fucking access, you have a smaller based area than the capitalist west, you have vastly less developed technological capacity, you have vast, much less concentrated capital that can circulate within the system. you have a lot of poverty and empoverishment and you have a lot of undeveloped areas that is still in uh the production of the production of uh agricultural surplus which has to be rationalized, you have to rationalize the distribution of agricultural surplus first and foremost and so cruisef is at the challenge of how do we create plenty and therefore allow ourselves to compete with the west, and they tried it with computer. and red plenty is a great book about that uh and it's not it's fictionalized so it it's really it's it's a very interesting format uh it just goes through the era and you see where there's a real attempt to marry planning with like technology with with algorithms and stuff and it falls short in large part because the soviet leadership is too adhered to their own power to rip power and most able and to effectively exercise it in the conditions that they were presented with would be in aim. economic warfare after that, and then of course the fucking germans showing up and killing half the country, those are the conditions that are creating that are forging the conflict within Russia, and with the Soviet Union, rather. and that means anybody with any fucking uh social conscious, any proletarian solidarity is gonna get fucking thrown away by the wayside, they were going to be destroyed, as were the dumb cynical people who couldn't just operate from uh from wiley uh planning, the only ones to win are these cynical people who are also smart. and that's Stalin, and he did a great job assuming the conditions he did, which is all right, now we're just going to be, we're just going to care about this state existing, and what's good for it is good for socialism, and there's no more socialism outside of it in the rest of the world, so that ends up becoming the framework for the rest of the cold war, and what a shock that we lose? but the challenge of Krushchev, the challenge to Krushev was to build sufficient technological capacity for solving the price problem, to distribute things, to allow the Soviet idea to to conquer cuz it isn't a idea, the reality is capitalism, the idea is socialism, and it can only do that if it is pressed forward with an idealistic way, but the Soviets didn't do that, they operated largely through real politique, now not totally, not like American empire, and that hurt them too, but they couldn't spread the idea after a while, and that's because they were locked into preserving the party, not preserving anything. as transcendent as the idea of socialism, but anything that happened in Russia is not their fault, it's Germany's fault, that is the thing, because Germany was supposed to answer the call and they fucking said who's this, new phone, so once it was clear. that the Soviets weren't going to be able to answer the question in the 70s when the when the what happened in the 70s is that uh all of the urgency on any meaningful question of solving the contradiction of a consumer socialist society under restrained resources was solved by oil prices going up the big uh the big oil shock in in in uh the 70s boosted the uh vastly boosted the Soviet export economy. and therefore allowed for this stagnation where the political crisis was bought off for the first time with the consumer uh the consumer glut that uh had been promised by Krushchev, but it wasn't because they'd actually solved the question of price and created efficiency there like they wanted to do, like Cyberson and Chelley wanted to do with before it was destroyed by Pinache, one of the great disasters of our time uh, is that they provided them with it. black sea vacations for workers, a fucking new washer drier in a shitty car, they actually were able to provide that for a little bit, but of course the iron ironic thing is is that that oil shock they they thought that it was the solution to the problems of the soviet state, it was actually dooming them, because once that shock wave went all the way around the world, it resulted in the full neoliberalization of the world politics and the destruction of the Soviet Union, because it is that oil shock the... breaks the kensian consensus at the top of capitalism in the United States and forces us to crack the whip in the political realm essentially to to to stop buying off and to start uh start enforcing austerity unevenly distributed towards the bottom away from political power, which is why the people at the center of the center of of uh capitalism succeeded and and and we're fine with it, the home-owner. class in the United States, they by the time the crisis came, they could, they were bought off sufficiently, that they're still republicans, they're still the base of this reaction within capitalism, but first it came for the urban blacks, like people think, people talk about uh the the the collapse of the of the the black community in the 70s and of course the conservative argument is that oh the their culture went to shit uh thankfully because we got rid of uh segregation because because they started comingling and and living luidly and luciviously, they lost their community center because they lost their uh their segregated character. that's the liberal, that's the conservative argument for what happened. what actually happened is is that the the small black working, black working to middle class that have been established for the white working to middle class after the world after World War II, was actually taking hold, they were actually starting to build some of it in the urban centers. They were actually going to build some wealth, build build an infrastructure and a social reality there, a fabric within capitalism, but then that oil shock that resulted in the reorientation away from uh from the labor end of uh distribution of profit towards the ownership end that's going to untip over the kein consensus into uh the final unraveling starts with the industrialization in the cities, which means the people who moved there most recently, the the black of the great migration period are the first to be uh deprived by it and what we see in the 90s and and the hillbillylogy phenomenon of white people oh my god these white people they're acting black that's the big horror of the Charles Murray thesis is why are these white people acting like black people socially and it's like well no it's nothing it's nothing to do with culture it's nothing to do with brain shape or any of this bullshit it's that the conditions of total emiseration in first, it hits the bottom, the poorest, the poorest urban uh minorities, then later uh, the poorest rural whites, rural and suburban whites, they fall off the board, and they stop, and they they become the they are now are are the poor uh, they're not as essentially as social, they are as politically alienated, basically as as as black people are, like not quite, but it's it's it's similar, uh, and then you have those remaining uh, bought out after world war 2, now it's shrinking, the the the ring of protection is going away, and the their expression of that alienation is this culture war, because they are consumed by the same matrix the rest of us are, and they cannot express their politics in class terms, because they don't live them and they don't believe themselves to to exist in those categories, those aren't uh defined to them with meaning, what means things to them? are questions of race, culture, nationalism, and therefore their politics reflect that, so that's that's the conflict we're seeing now, that is the that's all we have, instead of politics and that's why our only hope is the reemergence around labor of first resistant, first strike culture and then political culture, coming out of strike culture, that's going to be it, is going to be the the the conflicts, these lit in labor, fight, conflict, like not the cultural, cultural realm of politics, that'l come later, and it's going to also be going on at the local level now to seed bed, because remember, all big changes, all big shifts politically, are driven at the base by the ferment of class conflict, but they are like those torrents are moved through tributaries defined first by culture, by... politics, by formal conflict, by ideal conflict, because the people carrying out, the people creating these social forms that we live, are all outside of class conflict, there's they're not living class conflict, they're living the the fabricated conflict that their adherence to capitalism demands, and so they're called. reflects that and of course the real the real tragedy of the moment, and this is why I said red plenty instead of ministry for the future, and why I think ministry feel the future is a book that has similar questions on its mind, uh, is that the the question, the the the the dilemma that felled the Soviet experiment, that felled. actual existing socialism in the 20th century has been solved to a to a large enough extent to guide humanity away from total annihilation towards the continuation of like a social conflict a social project because the triop of capitalism equals the annihilation of the social that is i think that is that's a math i would write that on a board if i knew how math worked because it is total at the bottom, which means a smaller and smaller percentage at the top protected by technology until there are any left until they're destroyed mutually somehow, maybe a few of them escape into the singularity and they win, but the rest of us are annihilated, that is the axiomatic end point of capitalism, socialism could technologically, given that if we have the existing, given the existing level of technology that we have, a rational distribution of resources in which capitalism, the end the profit motive has been extinguished from the machinery, the machine that capitalism built, it's software, it's programming around capital around profit accumulation around surplus extraction has been uh removed, has been bleached out of the system. and then you boot in a new fucking software protocol towards rationalized technologically facilitated distribution of resources within the system. we have the sufficient concentration of capital now to do that. i think that is the fundamental argument of the book, ministry for the future. i'm not going to talk about it too much today because i kind of went on a tangent. i'll follow up more on this tomorrow, but suffice to say. and I think that is why the book has basically nothing to say about how this thing would happen, how this machinery would be seized by the working class of the world in any meaningful definition of that term. That is left pretty much unexplained, marginal, it is, it is turned into like a voice, it's turned into a feeling, it's turned into an experience rather than a description, and that's because that answer, the question cannot be answered. No, it's the same reason Marx couldn't know the capitalism was going to defeat the the conflict that he saw within it, technologically. He didn't know that was going to happen because that was the X factor. We're in a new world with new X factors. So the thing you can't know is what is going to move this thing at a grand level. All you can do is know what to do in the moment. And this book is essentially Kim Stanley Robinson saying. you're in the moment when it matters, imagine when you're in the moment when you can feel like what the right thing to do is, and instead of rationaliz your way around doing it, you do it, imagine every moment of your life where that counts and you make the right choice, the choice that's against maybe your best interest, because you're black pilled, because you've decided that nothing matters but you, that that there's no point in fighting anything truly, politics really is just a moral costume that you put on to validate your position within a system that you benefit from. and that's what rule that's that more or less has been what has ruled us all through our lives. now it doesn't rule us all the time, but it rules most of us most of the time. and honestly any any like the arc of history that that uh Martin Luther King talks about, that arc is defined by people pulling against that, but the thing is they don't do it uniformly, they do it one by one, but then if the right chain reaction is triggered by action, then in punches and then you can actually see the hand of God move into human affairs, but those moments are only retroact. respectively understandable as such, in the moment there's still contingeence decisions that we have to make instinctively, and what drives us is an emotional thing, it's not a, it's not a reason thing, and so we will be driven, and the question is, is that emotion tied to our self-interest, our narrow belief in ourself, or to a greater belief in others, in the world, in reality, in love to be incredibly cheesy about it, in meaning beyond words and beyond senses. because if the world can be defined by sensation, then words like love don't mean anything, emotions are essentially alien, they're basically random, and all you can do is pursue the most predictable ones, the most selfish ones, the most indulgent ones, because they're the most sure, the other ones require belief, they require you to be able to get in your head and imagine something. and have that thinking give you a feeling, that only comes from experience and by adhearing meanings, branding them with meaning through words, through words and symbols that we carry with us, and so if we're going to win, humanity is going to win this thing, which is a big if, i don't think i don't like our odds, but because we're here there's a chance, always a chance, definitionally buse remember this, these this this moment is always there, moment to choose love is always there, so you can't know, and so the book really does leave that, what's left is the skeleton of stuff that we could do if we felt like it, and that makes it very unsatisfying, obviously, but it does, I think still mean that it is a useful contribution to the literature, because for the people are more incline. believing that emotions don't have any kind of effect on reality, the reality is essentially knowable, and that emotions do not form its reality, that we don't essentially make reality emotionally, and that is that is the rational delusion. fact is is that all beliefs, all understanding the... it is a response to feeling, it's a response to bodily and sensorial and pre-verbal emotion, you have the feeling before you can put a word to it, which means rationalism is always going to miss that part of the world that is composed of pure feeling, but that is made by our rational perception of the world, that is the dialectical tension between the two, and you have to have a faith in that to act, and if you do, you will find the moments to act, and if enough of us do and the right, and we hit seven enough times on the fucking uh, on the craps table of of the universe, and the right hand falls the right way, we can do it, and this book is there to give the more rationally minded a little bit of faith in that, buse here is the what we could do if it was possible, there's a different energy in you rushing at a cockpit like flight 93. style, if you've got a pilot on the plane who you know could land it, then if you don't, you have like, you you think about it longer, you plan more ahead, you coordinate your actions better, because your fear has been overwhelmed by your belief in your future, if you work together, you don't have a fucking pilot and the pilots are dead, and there's these guys aiming the plane, a 747. you'll fight for yourself, we know that, unless that didn't happen, who knows, like I believe that's a possible result, I believe if people knew that a plane was been hijacked, they might do it, if not to just sit there, because they'd be driven there by fear, but they'd be driven there purely by fear, by animal fear untether to reason, because why would they wouldn't really have any reason to believe that they'd actually survive, they're just frantically acting, and and uh an understanding of this dynamic, reading history through this lens, seeing this dynamic play out throughout history and in the world around us, applying that dialectical lens, itselfes us, it sooths our fear and allows us to see the world through more clear eyes, because we are not being ever so momentarily made anxious by the bleeping alarm sound. the knowledge that we're on a fucking flight 93 with no auxiliary pilot, but if you really do, you have that knowledge tetherd to some transcendent understanding of the world, some transcendent understanding of meaning residing beyond the self, that gives you praxice, and so that is why I can't really ever, that's why I really sympathize with Robinson and reading this book because I feel like with a lot of these talks that I'm doing and a lot of my my like I guess you call it artistic project pretentiously of my career insanely you could call it has been to give voice to that understanding that dialectical fixedness that explanatory framework because it can soothe fear a little bit. can give you reason to believe that there's a possibility that there are there are machinery we can grasp, if we can push ourselves out of the matrix together, there's machinery in our grasp, yeah my throat is getting a little oh, i should wrap it up though, it's been i've gone long already, so i'll talk more specifically about the book tomorrow, but for today just that's a long way of talking about why i think uh it's interesting to study history politics and the contemporary sense it's interesting to apply the historical materialist heuristic to the culture that we consume because it can make us fitter actors in the world history can make us sharper it can make us less fearful more uh more truly virtuous, i mean i hate to be pretentious and and sound like a like a fucking grechoman, but like apply virtue to our public life, which is a real thing that we really have to, deal with, because the left that we have created online, i'm sorry is a left defined by capitalism, is a left off. because as I said this is a culture created and reinforced by the reality of social media. and so that is the only way that I could think of to take the fundamental contradiction that my job is to entrance you into this fantasy politics with the fact that I my goal now is to uh it's disenchant people from that you know the Howard Beal thing like how do you do that is that not a fundamental contradiction and it is but it's one that can be transcended by belief, by belief. I will keep doing this to the and I will continue to feel good about doing it, that's the important part, I will feel fulfilled, I will feel centered, I won't feel anxious, I won't feel guilty, I will not feel neurotic, I will feel kind of at peace, the degree to which I do what I think of earnestly is a good job of making the case to dis'. gauge, not at the level of discrete content consumption, because everyone now is a cyborg, no one can log off, because our understandings of ourselves are embedded in these matrisses, it's merely a question of emphasis and mindfulness to be pretentious about it, and and and and yoga pant mom about it, and so I can only feel good about doing this, but spending my time doing this, if I can feel that it is contributing to that. and that means that I have to be doing stuff that I believe in, and so I find that that's usually the case when I'm like doing these, like I feel very on the beam, I feel like this is good stuff, but it really is when I try to write, when I try to abstract in the cold, in without the like the the light on me, when I try to fill in the gaps, I find that that's when doubt starts creeping in, and that is really because I have no doubt that what I'm saying. now is is correct, but it is the specific language of reinforcement that i'm less confident of, because i'm not that talented, because these are different abilities born by different neural pathways that have been reinforced over time, that are now largely fixed because your neuroelasticity stops around 25, like the brain you have at 25, it's going to develop over time and change, but its basic structures are basically fixed, you're going to have essentially the same. of capacity to to add neurons as as as you did at 25, so I'm pretty much fixed there at this level of we want to call talent, so that means when I sit down and have to like in front of a thing, then self-interest in the form of do something that's more engaging and pleasurable because it's less anxiety producing, like post or watch a movie, since you can't do that, why wouldn't you? little gremlin, the demon on my shoulder, and so that means I'm less productive, and then that creates a cycle of uh, of self doubt and uh self-loathing and and recrimination and fear that then pull me towards indulging uh, and not doing the work that I got to do, and so that is the dynamic I'm working with, and what I've come to terms with, and I think it's like kind of me um, hopefully making a breakthrough is that this is not a conflict that i can resolve, this is the conflict that drives the whole project, this is the actual uh atom, this is the split atom at the center of the reactor, because like that state that those states of of of uh of contentment and tranquillity they uh, what interrupts them is intrusions of of the... selfish uh desire, and so they're going to pull you away from that unless you can constructively spend time, and so you balance the two, because if you do it for too long, then then eventually, you know, you're not a unless you've reached a level of spiritual attainment that I'm not at yet, you get pulled in that direction, devil, the devil gets louder in your ear, but "the uh fundamental conflict, the manachian delusion of Christianity is that that can be resolved one way or the other, and that's what powers are deformed politics." are are the cycle of indulgence and puritan abstamiousness that drives our culture, because we think we can stamp it out, we have to embrace it, we have to let those atoms spin around that nothingness at the center, and then power our machinery of life, and your challenge is to be aware of that condition, so that your actions are driven by uh, a felt. belief that what you should be doing is what's good for everybody else, because that will drive you towards good work in every sense, it will drive you towards doing your job earnestly and well to your best abilities, but also doing service in the community, helping people, helping friends, helping strangers, operating out of a felt sense of universal love that is maintain. by a rational understanding of what you should be doing in a moment, and that's where the the the uh, the the they live glasses of historical materialism are for you, getting a little froggy. uh, somebody says, um, just to wrap up here because this is a good, this is a good capstone, somebody says, is this like in 1984 when Winston says that he believes in the end the party will lose? yes, because uh, or well was only talking about the Soviet Union, like there's there is no universal application of uh, of his vision of of dystopia, which is why it's age so poorly, and why it's so irrelevant to the current moment or any? moment frankly, it's because he was so fixated from capitalism, from the boosom of capitalism with uh, with defeating the Soviet Union, and you could argue he had good reason to, because by that point it was a snarling beast, it was this whipped dog, it was this, this self-interested, brutalized, traumatized uh, haffling trying to survive in the wilderness, you should still have fought for it pro, if you're in the capitalist side, you should probably still have fought for it in a way that you could have. and he didn't, for whatever reason he didn't, and I honestly don't blame him too much, because the seeing, seeing uh, Barcelona in 1937, when the when those the communist crack down on the anarchists, being on the Anarchist side, it's hard not to take that personally, I can imagine, but so he's assuming this condition of scarcity, this condition where you have a party that is actually rationally distributing, but in a context of complete sc and that might have happened if the Soviets had somehow beaten the United States in the market in the market conflict or like one maybe one a nuclear war, I guess that's what could have happened, the Soviets had won a nuclear war, that might have been how the future goes, but if you assume the capitalism is going to win, which you should if you're in the west, and that that would be a bad thing, which you have to, you have to assume that the trimp of capitalism will be. that thing then you have to imagine what that would look like, and then you have the other guy, the opposite of Orwell, al brave new world supposes, what if capitalism wins, but on its own terms, capitalism is able to reach a level of technological sophistication that eludes the question of inputs that. obviates the necessity for exploited people, that obviates the necessity for any labor input at all, and since that book also has a nuclear war in it, you can kind of imagine that those two books are two visions of the future after a nuclear war, one where the Soviets win 1984, one where the United States wins, but also from within capitalism, so that assumes that it can sustain itself. "it assumes that it's a stable world, and it assumes that stability through technological innovation, yes, there is still need for a physical labor at the human level, but we have sufficient technological capacity to create humans designed to work that way without feeling exploited, literally changing humanity technologically, and that is always the understanding of capitalism, every utopia and dystopia of capitalism is prem'. on its ability to technologically overcome its own contradictions, because capitalism can only technologically overcome its own contradictions, over time as it is as it is triumphant, and so you have to ask yourself, if you're a capitalist, first of all, if you win, your best case scenario is a brave new world, everyone is a hedenist, there is a kind of a ritual uh, jungle orgy that takes the place of religious ritual, people live for eternal youth, they fixate on. youth and then they they just die, they just snap dead uh around age 60, they don't have to worry about seeing people get old, they don't have to worry about dealing with uh age or time, they get to live in a delusional, fantastic now until the moment they essentially get assassinated, it's like hey, what if capitalism was, you get to eat, drink and be merry and then you shoot you in the head when you're 60, that's a way to solve the question of uh inputs right, like okay we don't have to worry about us outstripping resources, because we're calling the population, but they don't mind because they're having such a good time, that's your best case scenario under capitalism, so if you believe in capitalism and you also are a believer in any kind of uh like traditional reality, some traditional masculinity, any of that stuff, no, not going to happen, you're probably going to be an upsilon semi mororon and then you're going to get to watch all the fucking uh alphas just fuck and suck until they get thrown into a meat grinder. now you're forgetting, i said 60, but part of the technology. they have is that they extend vitality so that people aren't feeling aging, they they feel, you feel like you're like you're in your 20s or 30s until 60, and you look that way too, that's the important part, so you got to say, if you like capitalism, that's your best case scenario, but here's the important thing, that will never happen, because we are now at the point where we see the inputs, capacity, do we have it, do we have the technological capacity to rationalize human production? yes, not without. bumps, not without conflict, not without violence, not without mass death, but mass death was going to happen anyway, we're talking handlable mass death, George C Scott, I'm not saying we won't get our hairmus, the alternative is mega death with a few people left in their bubble sucking and fucking for eternity until something breaks in their equilibrium and then they are eliminated and annihilated, or they all become computer programs, then the computer program will end and that moment will be eteral, the moment that will be fraternal is the moment of extinguishment, hell or heaven, because there is a non-braven world, desacralized hell world version of that post scarcity reality that is possible, a world where people get to live natural lives, live natural liveespans. are content and happy along all of them, are in some sort of harmony with the world, have some sort of spiritual belief that transcends the the x and o's of human life, the limitations of a singular life, lifetime, you believe in a life beyond that, an everlasting, eternal reality, that you are, of course also part of for every moment, but which you lack the senses to be able to be aware of most of the time because you've been thrust into the shit hell uh deatomized end of history, we are now shredded moanads trying to rebuild all of our sensory organs from scratch every moment, every moment we're we're like we're feeling the raw tendrals of our severed social connections and our need for some sort of meaning that transcends our physical place in the world, and then it is seared shut. by the the grinding mechanisms of the market overalhing our ability to act independently of them, being driven more and more to become androids, this is unstable, it will break, the system will break, how will it break, will be up to us, so we must be ready, we must be vigilant. All right, I'm gonna get some drinks, I'm a little uh, a little parched after that, so see you dudes later, dudes and dudets, major league but kicking is back on, what is it, dudes and dude that's major league buck kicking is back online, is that it? Back in town. for some reason that's not what that sounded like dudes and dudets major league but kicking is back in town.
