 lonely feeling deep inside find a corner or i can't hide silent footsteps crowding me sudden darkness but i can see no sugar tony or coffee, no sugar to night or cream, no sugar to stand beside me, no sugar to run with me, in the silence of a mind, quiet movements where i can find grabbing for me with her eyes, now i'm falling from her sky, it's no sugar to night or coffee, no sugar to not or cream, no sugar to stand beside me, no sugar to run with me, now now johnny meme onic there. There we go, everybody, have you heard, if you in the game, then the strokes the word, get your contribution, constitution by your side, smoking, you got the now, stroke man, stroke man, he is a siner, but maybe he is a sinner now, i love how many songs uh have been written that are basically about how uh show business is fake, a lot of people become stars and they're like, you know what i think a lot of these, i think a lot of these um show folk out here and holly weird they actually uh they don't they don't uh say what they mean all the time and sometimes they uh they tell you what that you want they want you to hear so that they can pick your pocket i mean what's going on they all turn into Jimmy Stewart as soon as they get the Hollywood what's going on around here I sign a record contract and and they're trying to screw me yeah sorry huckleberry what did you think this was and then they just have to write a song about it to let everybody know. and then what do you know everybody just keeps going and keeps trying to go into the the the dream factory and nobody is dissuaded no matter how many of these songs get written or how many of these movies get made because what is there else to seek? people want to know why oh uh all the kids want to be youtubers they want to be uh content creators and why everybody always wants to be an athlete or a rapper instead of it's because in the absence of any project. in the absence of any belief in a social order, any belief that your efforts put towards it are going to be either is are going to be appreciated or utilized to any greater benefit to anyone, if you if if the world is just cynical transactions, then what the fuck should you try to do with your life other than be uh the center of attention to reify that identity, that that singular consciousness that is the entire. of the universe because here's the thing, if you make a world where everybody is god and then most of them just have to be regular fucking people and do shitty jobs, they're going to get uh annoyed with that, they're going to get in, in fact the brains are basically going to eventually explode from the cognitive dissonance of being god and yet being powerless, so of course everyone's going to seek fucking employment where they can be unalienated, which is as close to post capitalist as you can imagine, which is the idea of... life as god. now a little bit of alienation could be accepted if you think you're fucking building something beyond yourself, but if a society builds a if you are brought into a a structured reality that says no, the only uh pursuit is selfishness, the only uh point of view is your own, the only reality is your body, well then you're going to operate from those premises and that means you're. not going to put any effort into anything that isn't immediately uh validating and that means of course you want money and of course you want to have time by yours uh for yourself and not uh according to a boss. but more than anything, you need to be noticed, you need to be seen, you need to be famous, you have to be famous, or else how are you, the soul uh fucking consciousness in the galaxy, that that gap is too great, your brain can't handle the cognitive dissonance of living as one of many, when when everything you've encountered culturally tells you that you're the only fucking thing in the universe, that can't that's unsustainable, that's why people seek to their own. destruction, fame and fortune, and that's why I did, fuck in my lazy, cowardly way of just yearning for it, and then complaining about it long enough that a fucking technology came along to allow you the opportunity to get known for complaining, that's why everybody wants to be a critic, because if there is no energy to produce art, because you have no faith in the project of society, then what you want is uh the fame without the risk, which is criticizing other stuff, politically, artistically, the critic is the default model, if you can't be uh, if you can't if you aren't talented enough to do it effortlessly, like you're a great, you're very attractive, and that means you can become famous just you know by acting or something, or you are an actor with a charisma, which is another thing that is relatively effortless, uh, even if it requires you know application, but it's application towards a singular goal of... fame, those people get famous and if you have athletic ability, those people get famous, but if you're not, if you don't have those things, if all you have is this ego and this disempowered's position as just one of the fucking flotsum, the consumer blobs to make up America uh, then you're going to get annoyed with it and you're going to complain, and along came of technology to allow your complaints to be turned into content, and then you've created an entire fucking economy of critique, which is people trying to recken with their insignificance in a world where they're the only fucking consciousness that exists, but it's all a flight away from effort because of it's it is a lot a lack of belief and the thing about the belief is the belief doesn't go away, like obviously uh modernity is this huge hundreds of year arc of disenchant. with the world right, like the world losing its magic, the uh the uh life because like that is which is unquantifiable is where mystery and uh and religion and spirit live, and the quantifiable has overtake, has consumed the world, but that doesn't mean that belief goes away, buse at the end of the day you have to believe enough to keep your blood pumping in your body, and the thing that you believe in if you can't believe in anything outside of the body is the body itself and the mind and identity that pilot it, and so we believe more than ever, we believe as much as any people in history have ever believed, but we only believe in ourselves, and not in the I believe in myself way, as in the ourselves are fantasy, social fiction that we have turned into reality, because remember this self is not real anymore than our social bonds are real, any more than any ideological construction out of the the the the explosive random uh matter that we we encounter every day uh is real, but we act as though it were, it used to be one thing of many that we believed in, now all of that belief is concentrated into the self, and all we're seeing the the a species suicide. is due to the fact that we only believe in ourselves, which means we can only pursue the most narrow, short-term carnal self-interest, and that means uh, that means that we can only operate through capitalism, we can only operate through market relationships and that in a context of finite resources that will spell the death of the planet. now that's not black pill, that's not. the end of the world, because beliefs fucking change, but humans have to believe to live, but what they believe in changes, what we believe in changes, yes, like this is a perfect example, it's not like believing in the self is evil and... be extinguished, it's inevitable, it just, it used to be a smaller part of our conception of reality. uh, somebody put a good post here, self-interest makes class politics relevant, exactly, exactly, uh, the emergence of the liberal self is what allows class consciousness to come into being, like peasants would rebell cyclically, but never along any kind, for the most part not in in a coherent uh uh, like understanding of the politics and as a group, it was, spasm against like their most immediate oppressor, they were usually doing their violence on behalf of the king in their own minds anyway, the kind of uh like strategically um the strategically powerful and and threatening uh and formidable class politics that is oriented against capital as it is is only allow is only possible with the individuatedself. doing their alienation enough to stand up for themselves, for themselves, for their idea of themselves as having inherent value and if their time and having inherent value, their time on earth, their time having consciousness, that time has value, they want to assert it, but you have to feel it as a separation, you have to feel alienation as a loss, so it's it's inherent and then necessary, but we lost the war is the thing, the socialist spirit was awake. at the dawn of capitalism and marx was right there to see it coming into fruition, but that fight was lost, that fight was lost, i would say in the years 1914 to 1922, i would say that and that everything then since then has been a holding action, and that we have reached a period of of capitalist of complete capitalist domination, the end of history as discussed and why he really was right, but the thing is the... something comes after the end of history, because we're in a fucking system that cannot sustain it, contradictions between the material conditions and the fantasies in the heads of our uh self deluted uh capitalist rulers will break it down and we will still be here. Someone makes a very good point here that historically capitalism is obselete and this is what mexes people up a lot of the times because we are far past the point when capitalism has uh has seased to fulfill its historic uh purpose because remember Marx was not did not hate capitalism, the the whole the first third of the the communist manifesto is a pay-on to capitalism's progressive features, capitalism in marxism has a historic role, I think what you would call late capitalism, what you would call the whatever this neoliberal like techno feudal, whatever the hell you want to call it, the post 1918, 1989 world is uh... really capitalism having um gone beyond its historic role, it's still holding on because of it's the belief in it, it's ability to create a self-sustaining magnetic like electromagnetically charged cultural gemany, like we have created people who cannot live together, cannot cooperate, create people who are incapable of doing it under the conditions that they emerge, the isolated, socially atomized conditions with a global uh uh supply chain that keeps uh the most horrifying exploitation of the system as far as humanly possible, geographically and culturally from the center of consumption. and what and that means that even though we have by far the tech the capitalist accumulation necessary to equalize the pain of being alive and not fully but in a vastly masly more than we are and in a way that could preserve the biosphere, but the people who could do that are not us. now that doesn't mean they won't be us at some point, but it means right now they're not us and getting there, getting to those people is everyone's task, and if that's fails, if humanity fails, then you will see uh capitalism just following along as to its uh technological extinction, and how long that will take, but it would it will occur, and that is, those are all open variables, so I can't say, it mostly comes down to how much technology emerges that can sustain it, and of course there is the Zard option that the rich are able to put. technology between themselves and exploitation, because that's what it is, you're putting technology allows you to put distance between exploitation and the uh consumption of the pro product of exploitation, between the extraction of surplus value and the enjoyment of surplus value, that's what technology allows. you could get to a point if the technology happens and this is all who knows i'm not a tech person that allows them to the... allows the rich to seal themselves off as in create in a bubble the post uh the totally automated reality sealing themselves in and then you have ironically enough as Peter frays out points out in his book for futures, you have fully luxurated space communism. congratulations, you've got it, but you've got it without those people being transformed by the process of building it, which means there's still demon monads who will destroy themselves. as happens is Zardos, which is a great, great movie, I highly recommend. The only people who can survive the Frankly, the bordom, the bordom, the only people who could survive the bordom of fully luxuriated space communists, communism would be people who had a decenttered themselves, not removed their sense of self, not become a mind, but reduce their sense of self and to put it into a social project, because even in the how is it that in the center of America, in the center of this system of exploitation where all of the people are living basically post scarcity lives, like to live in the the middle quartile, especially if you have one of these jobs in media, or around media, iE the people who are actually doing all the content that people interact with that shapes their understanding. what political culture is, they're miserable, even though they live post scarcity lives for the most part, yes, they're a little exploitated, exploited, but they know, there's some of the few people left on earth who know that their effort will be rewarded, who knows that trying will get them something, so of course, so these are essentially post-capitalist subjects in their lives and they're fucking miserable, and they build an insanity of a political insane asylum to wage war. so how the hell do you think they're going to operate where the reality is high uh, welcome to life, you're not going to have to struggle for anything uh for your basic existence, you're not going to have to struggle to keep yourself sustained as a person, but you are going to die, you're going to go through life, having experiences accumulating a sense of self uh until it's really the your only frame of reference for the world around you, and then at some point it's going to stop, good luck, have fun, it's the grit, it's the it's the people neurosis is postmodern neurosis, i think the neurosthesia of our new victorian like drawing room class, the yellow wallpaper people, which is all of us, really, if you're listening to this, you have the yellow wallpaper disease a little bit, i know i do, i mean once again, i'm speaking about myself, if you say we we're not miserable, we just want healthcare, i'm not talking. about that, I'm talking about people in my position, the people structure this stuff, and then how it respond, I'm just saying as an example, these are as close, this is as good as it gets under the system, and it results in people building fantasies of anxiety to build give themselves something to worry about, like fuck the Robin Deangelo thesis, these these comfortable, well off white people who live in the center of an exploitative nightmare system and know that, but also are addicted to the pleasure of it, resolving that, and it is by giving themselves a neurotic fixation on um, uh, on their level of racism, and that is, like if you want to talk about like the hysteria of wokeness of one white people, that's what it is, it is this need to self to self absolve, it is the neopuritan need to be dissolved of the guilt of living as you do, because you know it's bad, but there's nothing else to do, and the thing is, I don't, there is nothing else for you to do, in the sense that you can work towards you know, the betterment of the world, but you're probably still going to be at the center of empire, you're probably still going to be exploiting people somewhere, but you have to live with it, and do you live with it by indulging in a fantasy or do you live with it by facing the reality around you? and the answer to that question comes down to how much are you trying to reinforce yourself, how much are you trying to get pleasure out of this? and that's the thing about the neurosis of of of this shit is that it gives you pleasure, you don't have to sacrifice, all that pain you're feeling, all that misery. uh the thing about freaking out about uh oh no one's wearing masks oh my god what if how long they're telling me i don't have to wear a mask but i want to keep wearing a mask all of that is pleasure at a sense it is a game you're playing with yourself instead of thinking about the reality that you're a cut off consciousness floating through space there is in a system lubricated by other people's blood. so that is why uh this is this is a process, this is a process of creating a species that is aware of itself, as in has detached some percentage of its belief away from in itself into others into that oh yeah there is stuff outside of there that's real, that's real as as real as i am, and that's what makes people. struggle, sacrifice, that's what makes work unaalienating, and there has to be work, we got to work, but that is unalienated labor, and unalienated labor build a goddamn, could build a dyson speir, make America live forever, make American, make a make humanity extend itself into this cosmos, because we have so much technology, holy shit, we have so much stuff that fucking marx thought that uh capitalism. it was fulfilling its historic uh role already when all they had is like some fucking steam powered looms like a machine that would like go oh yeah it goes like this and it and it powers a fucking uh a sewing machine we have the ability to centrally plan a world sized economy through simulate simulations within uh within uh uh computers We can map the world in a way to allow all of our automated technology to fucking extend across it. But that's that would be if we believed in something different. The tools we have are sufficient if the people were different. And it's us and the process, this history is us grinding those two things against each other, because they can't just shift spontaneously. That is the fantasy, I think of a lot, not all, but a lot of anarchists, is a spontaneous phase shift where you can go. being a full, i'm a full individual vigi visual and i believe in uh with everything being good for other people, but mostly out of a understanding of like utilitarian ethics, i understand that what is good for the many is good for me too, i can go from that person to a state of uh post-capitalist uh post-scarcity, can't do that, you have to work, you have to change, and that change has to change others and then the next generation to people have to change too, it's a it is fuck fucking vaber in his slow boring of hard boards, oh yeah, that's yes of course, that's that's what politics is, it's also what revolution is by definition, unless you want to skip steps, which everybody wants to do, and i totally get it, but here's the thing, wanting to skip steps is wanting to feed the ego, wanting to skip steps is wanting to keep doing what you're doing already, buse it feels good, and even the stuff that feels bad feels good, because contrast with the other stuff, it gives you something to chase after, it gives you a hidonic treadmill to run, the stuff that makes you see the world as it is, that is the desire to actually see things better and actually change things, unshoren of pleasure, and of course like this doesn't point in any direction, this is all bullshit because I'm just trying to say that... that there has to be of the most advanced people, like there are progressive and and and uh and reactionary forces within any polity, even in the center of the decadent world uh uh capitalist empire that's consuming the fucking globe, um, fuck I realize that whatever. What do we got here? but there is politics here and it has to uh, people have, people are, it's made by people talking to each other right now, because there are any structures to join, there isn't any real, there is no left to join, there are organizations you can join as an individual, but there is no self-conscious left to join in this country, it has to be built, and so people are right now, all of us are faced with the choice of what do we do every day to try to make that happen, and all I I'm trying to ask myself question, well what could I do? well, I'm totally isolated, I'm completely cut off, I am not a worker, I am not in the working class, I am part of that remaining uh section of uh of uh artisans uh, but also even there I am emeshed in capitalism as much as any other PMC, so and I could sever all of those cords immediately and try to fight for the working class, how could I do that, what could I do in? that uh capacity as a middle-aged limping man with no actual skills or abilities, i could try something, but it's a big leap, what, what do i actually, what, where am i? i'm in this position, there's there's these people listen to what i'm saying, if i'm going to keep doing that for now, because i honestly don't know what else to do in the middle of this this pandemic that is now even further cellularized me, i can try to. makes sense of what to fucking say, transparentize the question, and uh, and realize that, okay, if everybody's seeking this, if I can assume everyone as good faith is trying to seek betterment, then all I could do is tell them, not what to do, because I'm not in a position, but how to go about doing it, I'm not in position to tell anybody what to do, I don't fucking have any idea, I'm i no connection to the working class, i have no connection to any movements, i have an idea of how you can approach these questions, um, but that's it, and of course that allows me to stay here and kushy in my home, and that's the other thing is that you have this fire in your stomach, this combination of like uh, the the ache of of distance from you know uh, the sacred and then also that knowledge that it exists, and you've got those, and that I think is what causes us to feel to feel things and to be able to build a world around the feelings, because we have to translate feelings through that tunnel into conscious ideas and that means being present for the feelings in order to be nearest to that that moment, instead of allowing it all to get alienated by us thinking all the fucking time, which I know I am very, very guilty of doing, because what happens is is that even if you have this feeling, if you can't stoke it socially, if you're not stoking it through action, you are only thinking about it, you are only in the moment abstracting away, sort of a logical cage, a syntactic structure. that can contain that idea, but that can only be made up of the stuff you've ever experienced, it's it's it is consue it is constructed of the experience of the world around you, which means it's locked up in the idea of the self, the idea of uh of of the uh singularity of your consciousness, like you're still in that body, you're still in that mind that has those traumas and associations built into it. and so as you try to keep this, this feeling and you keep trying to keep it alive through thought, the thought continues to drift farther and farther away from the feeling because you are fallen from it in time, literally in time you're trying to remember something, and the longer you try to remember something, the more you have to sort of uh improvise to keep it going and to justify why you're not feeling. because the only way to keep those feelings in turn them into thoughts, into practice, practices, which I now understand how that's a useful term because you really can't disengage the two, because you what keeps it alive is uh cooperation is interaction with others socially is a social lived experience and the problem is is that it for it to work to to be effective you have to be interacting with people who share your mental construction who have the same associations you have between words and feelings and that's tough, that's very difficult, and so people go online to try to find people like that, but we're not interacting with ourselves as real embodie people, we're operating as just pure ego uh, projections of that person, shoren from any real feeling, and so we just fight and build castles in the sky and and wage mind comp on each other, meanwile our bodies are just sitting there our bodies are just sitting in time, feeling nothing, and so we come back into our bodies, not fortified for the fight, but uh, reafied in in the in the hopelessness and pointlessness of fighting, because what's the use? and also i'm fucking tired cuuse my orgone just went out the top of my head into this fucking internet. It is dualistic in the sense that there is a dual there is an that the dialectic is made of of uh of opposites and the un dissolved there have there has to be at base and uh irresolvable opposite and it's between space and time. That is the one opposite. within the the the pluralistic universe that is one, that is one thing, there is still space in time, and everything else, the creation of the universe, the bring into consciousness of human or bringing into existence of life, the bring into consciousness of humanity, these are all and then human history and the development of human civilization are all powered by that contradiction. Space and time are the same thing, of course, but there's still a contradiction between them, heisenberg, like something happens to me, I have a feeling. i something touches me and then i feel the touch, that doesn't happen simultaneously, it happens afterwards, my my body dies before my mind dies, which is really what all of this is about, the knowledge we have that our fucking bodies die before our minds do, that means that we have to know it's some level, at some instinctive level what to do when the moment comes. All right, we might get a dmt hit exactly, but what is that hit going to be, it's you're not going to get to choose it, you're not going to get to fucking uh, put it up on the jukebox, it's going to be powered by your deepest below conscious constructions, where you did not, where you have only been at... after those were formed trying to make sense of them in your conscious mind. so yeah, oh that made sense somewhat, i know it got a little wacky there at the end, all the quantum stuff, i try not to talk about it because i don't get, i don't understand it, i feel like i get it enough where it's just like you know you got like you have a reality tunnel that's made out of different pieces and the different sizes and some are very granular some concepts you got a bunch you can just go over there and you can feel it and you just you feel very confident in it and there's other stuff that's that's solid but still pretty thin or pretty uh, pretty big, you know, it's pretty smooth, not a lot of grip, and for me all that shit is is very smooth, but at the same time I know I'm not going to get it anymore than I do, so once again I'm going to do a leap of faith that yeah, broadly I know what's going on there, and then the thing is it makes sense with everything else, it's just putting it together fucking out of the out of the cracked pottery of of your perceptions of life is putting together a fucking mosaic tablet. and then if you can get one that aligns your heart and your head and you can live it, live it with other people that reinforce it both for you and for them, you create a reality. Here's a good one, why can Japan have such a cool spiritual and philosophical history, also such a bloody and imperialist material history, because we have been running through, every existing civilization has been one mark by class domination, all cultures, all societies are first and... for most structures of class power, all religious traditions and spiritualities exist within them, the ideas of those have residences that operate in different ways and under different context, so even though the the the the earliest strains of things like Buddhism, and Hinduism and Christianity, and people in a specific space experiencing something at the same time and having those experiences fused into language and symbols and then carrying those symbols outward, some of the people encountering those symbols are going to have a similar experience, others are going to have an experience from the outside of it that finds it useful, and power will take any structure and symbol and turn it towards its use, buse it can, cuz it has power, it's going to take anything because it can, now there'll be a resistance, but if it's powerful enough, it will keep it, and if it's not powerful enough, whatever emerges from it, well because class is not been conquered, well reinscribe class uh domination and use the stuff for their own method, for their own benefit, so our task is not to accept or reject religious traditions in in their uh cultural like their their their dennuted cultural context, you need to ask yourself what religious symbology, what religious concepts, what spiritual premises, whatever actually make you feel something, actually resonate and then you can build from there, but Yeah, from, everything has been tainted, everything is is a instrument of domination, everything is a a tool of agemity. I mean, my god, like on their own terms, forget what, forget their mystification. their own terms, the guys who settled uh at the United States and wanted to turn it into the city on the hill, you brought them, you you snapped your fingers and brought them to this and say, here is it is, they would they would go insane, the vulgarness, the the monstrous uh uh, fallen disgusting materialist filth of it would drive them insane, and a lot of right-wingers like to say that, they like to complain, oh our early Americans would be disgusted. but here's the thing, they made this happen because their conceptions were never defeated, they were the leading, they were the top proposition, that they were their... concept, the their their despiritualized christianity, their materialist christianity made this world, because they won, they fought other things and in the fighting created new things and created synthesis out of other things, but they were never unseated from the horse, and what do we have for it, even on their own terms, it's hell, because that's what you'll create, you'll create your own hell trying to build a world out of exploitation. out of class domination, which is committing violence, it is violence to someone that you have to in your heart detach yourself from in a way that kills your own spirit, and being in that position of exploitation causes you, for very obvious and understandable reasons, to detach yourself from the people dominating you, and hurts your spirit, and then you fight over the scraps for the next 300. no matter what fucking language of religiosity and spirituality you use, you're just building that the structures that allow you to do that, because these guys won of founding generation, the founding generation would be horrified, why? they won, we still have the stupid. constitution, their dumb instruction manual is still in power, and what can they say, oh, you distorted it, oh, you, you stopped paying attention to it, I'm sorry, how was that allowed to happen, power was exercised through its structures and dominated, it's a fucking instrument of power, what are you complaining about, and what's this, the people, the whole, the real point of this thing, as Madison, others said plainly, had nothing to do with creating a civic, anything, it was keeping the rich people rich so that they could maintain their position of... authority and it worked, the rich have never been uh, been close to being dehorsed from American power, and now we have this world, if your rule led you to this of what use was the rule, because all anything that you're trying to build, you you will convince yourself no matter how evil the system you support is is that some part of it corresponds to a value somewhere, and that's the the cultural superstructure exists to lie to you, it is generated by the... class to tell the ruling class that up is down, down is up and that exploitation is love, now they're convincing themselves of this because of their deep selfishness, but at a conscious level they believe a lot of it, at least some of them do, i would say that like with anyone it is a fucking bell curve, most due to some extent, some do completely, some do not at all, like reinhard hydric types, but most people believe to some degree that they're trying to build a better world or the best possible world and their power allows them to create a system where everyone around them say thinks the same thing and that's where we are now and where we've always been revolution is the attempt from below for to organize a counterhegeminey with with values that organize around the reality, the consonance of human uh of human dignity, the the equal of the spirit and creating a culture where where everyone else believes with that and reinforces it to you and then through superior numbers overcoming the powerful that's what that's what was supposed to happen the hingepoint in history was in the early 20th century when you had gotten finally industrial capitalism had overheated in Europe where it was born it had followed the script of marx to doom but what's this? at colonialism, what's this? the existence of the United States of America as a place where capitalism's headquarters, it's brainstem could decamp after World War II, where it had uh synthesized, it had the United States, while the United, while Europe was overheating with with uh capitalism, the steam vent of conflict went to America where the the the bounty of our land allowed us to uh... resolve away all a lot of the social conflict at the heart of the European capitalism within the white race by dominating other races, and then that meant that in Europe the explosion happened right around when you could have predicted it, but even though the fight was significant and and there was a big long uh holding action at the end, you even though the like the battle, want to look back and say like the class war uh in the class war yeah uh in the class war gettiesburg are like world war one and the failure of the German revolution, but then you've got Soviet Union in there, you got the Chinese, then you have the anti-colonial movements of the third world, and then the labor movement in the first, and they hold off for a while, and then that's that's Lee retreating into northern Virginia, and then of course, 1989 is Apomatics. but now the the contradictions, the material contradictions continue, so we're gonna still see uh possibilities emerge, erupt and change, but like the the the the the thing that saved capitalism was uh space, was space and resources that could be technologically dominated to uh to alleviate a away from the centers of power, the uh exploitation of those closest to it, IE, the working classes of the working class of Europe and the the racially white working class of the United States, although sections of other minority groups too, just in in, you know, in a uh in a segregated fashion, and yeah, we got like... Oh yeah, Cuba, God bless Cuba, but Cuba is like, you know, they're uh, they're the hold out in the jungle and they should stay there, they're, but that doesn't mean that they uh, can challenge capitalism. Why was Japan able to westernize and become an imperial power despite happening? because it was isolated, because it was by itself, because it was not uh, it was able to end, end its feudal era, I don't know that much about Japan, but this fuelera was marked by such intense uh, essentially what you had in Europe in Japan was the same thing you had in Europe, which is a a growing population in a relatively constrained geographic area. of course this is on a smaller scale uh which uh fighting over uh resources which means state formation and state capacity being built very very effectively bureaucratic uh the bureaucratic state and the technological state it is that this is this is all from shidle uh this this i really do believe that the thing that creates that that created progress the the the capitalism uh and the conditions for capitalism which allowed Japan to adopt it as quickly as they did uh is uh medium-sized state competition, and in Japan you had like the shoganate, but within it you had just a constant conflict between low-level uh rulers, you did not have any kind of dominant uh um state-wide uh monopoly on force, and that's what you didn't have in Europe either, there was no monopoly of force. and of course state competition is one state attempting to dominate another at the expense of the other and that and and when you have uh situations like Europe it makes sense and you have japan it makes sense but then oh what's this we have a world system now we have a totally connected economic structure oh no what what are we competing about now we're what is what is the actual competition here oh shit we're really just creating these artificial structures to a lot for uh capital to circulate completely independently of labor, fuck, might want to start uh cooperating, might be a good idea, but i don't know, we'll see. I don't know, Latin America, if there is hope, it's hope in Latin America, that's my in Africa, but I don't know as much, but definitely Latin America where you have, you have a legacy of you know a 20th century left that still has actual social uh function. and cohesion, I mean obviously it's under assault, but there does seem to be the capacity for coordinated uh resistance there, and politically expressed resistance, uh, and that means it's that's why it's been such a fucking bloody blood soaked horror ground of the cold war, that's where the fucking that's where uh, outside of like southeast Asia, that is where the most uh, most people were sacrificed to uh dollar hegemoneny in the cold in the in the uh cold war was uh was in Latin America because of the the the fucking the effectiveness of... and the resilience of the resistance and uh like if if Latin America could become in some way like a coherent left block that could then play like tip the balance between the United States and China and like force some sort of uh accommodation with China. It's not it's not world communism but it's... better than the alternative. uh, if anyone's read Vince Beven's great book, the Jakarda method, he uh, one of the things that's great about it is that he contextualizes the indonesian genocide in the cold war in a way that uh, I don't think necessarily everyone would have done, and I think it comes from the fact that he wrote, he was a journalist in Brazil for many years before he went to Indonesia is. he pointed out that the Jakarta method uh while it was obviously first you know tried out in Indonesia was really extended and perfected over the cold war not in the rest of uh Asia but in Latin America in Chile and in Argentina and in fucking Brazil the entire the fucking operation condor and then you have the fact that the... colombian government has basically been an American like client military, the colombia, somebody just said like the colombian president or something said, somebody says that colombia is the Israel of Latin America and we're proud of it, yes exactly, even though Bolsonaro of course loves and smooches uh um he loves uh Israel, Brazil is coming late to the party here, like Colombia has been the uh military the extended military footprint of the United States uh into Latin America uh for generation now mostly under the guys of the drug war, but of course it's that is mostly about arming uh narco-terror gangs who make sure that union organizers get killed and peasants are uh continue being dispossessed like plan it was called plan colombia you know so in Brazil was never really... a a flash point of that particular site you know uh fake uh conduit for American military weapons and training and and personnel so yeah Colombia is the fucking Israel of uh of Latin America but now you're getting this massive uh uh resistance and it's being repressed violently and that's terrifying and horrible but when you see that this is not and that this is a pattern throughout all of the nations of South America for the most part uh, if there's hope I think that's where it is, but again I don't know enough about Latin American uh Latin American politics right now, I don't speak Spanish or Portuguese, to know the specifics, but looking at it from a scance, from a far, it seems that's where like human, the potential for for actual organization that could be effective. uh exists oh somebody wants to talk about the labor party uh lol that's all i got to say there lol that's so fucking good just eating shit losing a seat that they've held since the 60s uh whatever i mean they had their chance England had their chance and they were uh they were too miserable to pull it off they're too they're too far gone and why shouldn't they be they're the one did this to us, like obviously we are all, we all did this too, but we we were born into a world shaped more than America than buy those disgusting fucking angles, and it's not their fault, it's where they were, that was, that's the strategy, when you're out there in the fucking north Atlantic at the edge of Europe, nothing but some fucking sheep folds, no resources, what are you going to do, and they did it. they took over the world, they jacked everybody else's shit, now all their edible food comes from thousands of miles away, but they're miserable about it, as I said, they're miserable about it, they got all they want, they got out on top, they got... they got to trade off, they got to sell high on the British empire because they could have lost it all, I mean my god, imagine a some sort of uh third worldest overthrow of of uh the British Empire, instead of them getting to to just sign it over to the United States and then get to get a nice welfare state after the war, they're miserable. because every short-term deal that you make with the with molek kills you in the end, because you're being stripped, you're selling your soul, you're selling your soul, you're selling it piece by piece until you're born into a soulless world, what like England, yeah, England souls, we're basically souls, and it's all about your distance, how long you have been a society fully alienated. so it'll be very interesting to see, it'll be very interesting to see how I mean obviously, it's not like this is gonna change the labor party, they they're they won, the blarright scum uh are ascendant, they're just going to keep uh bullshitting uh and blaming corbin. so and then they'll they'll get wiped out in the next election and uh you'll get it another crowd who promises not the same not to make the same mistakes and it's going to be somehow not tainted by it but they're going to be the same guys. I don't know anything about somebody asking about the Albanian elections, I don't know anything about it, someone's asking if it's a relevant to current moments, is what did the hoja, did like enver hoja's kid get in or something? what happened in Albania? did the... um oh yes, envverhoja junior won up with the uh more bunkers party. why did the this is a very good question to end on, why did the ANC go neoliberal? uh, I would argue for the same reason that uh Michael Collins came back uh to Ireland with uh the treaty, because it's the deal they thought they could get, and they figured, well, if we get political power, well. able to turn it into economic power, but it turns out, no, the moment for that was gone, historically, i don't think it's any coincidence that you see the end of apartide after the fall of communism, with the soviets out of the picture, it's a different question about whether you hand over uh political power to to the blacks, because as long as... the uh the economic heights have been held by whitees on behalf of capital uh let the let them let them go, let them do it, if it's what keeps the system going and what maintains uh the flows, the spice, let them have it, and knowing that there was no leverage to get beyond the political sub uh, because where would where would there uh if they demanded no? we demand uh control of the economy, we we demand like central bank authority and all that stuff, uh, how much of that western uh support that they got for their boycot and sanctions and shit would still exist? so they got a deal and they got power and it helped, it helped, it it materially benefited in some respects and more importantly, it materially benefited some people, and that is the problem. with uh, that is the inherent issue with uh with communal politics like... that is stripped of a class conflict is that once you get an ANC that is that is just another political capitalist political party, it ends up existing to benefit people who are already on inside sort of the the bubble of the the the small bourgeois and higher and you just enlarging the bourgeois and you racially diversify the bourgeois without changing the class structure. All right, I think that'll be, that'll be the game for tonight. hope it went well, hope it made a little bit of sense, what is this gismo?
