 b at the side of the road, it means 15 miles to the low shack, love shack baby, love shack baby, got me a crisler, it's as big as a whale, and it's about to set sail, i got me a crisler, it seats about 20, so come along and bring your jukebox money. "the love shark is a little known place where we can get together, love shack baby, love shack baby, that's sign says, stay away fools, cuz love rules at the love shack." All right, we're live, wait for some people to fill the in here, if you see a big sign at the silland, says stay away fools as love rules at the love around and around and around and around and everybody's going baby folks lining up outside just to get down like a little shack funky little shack okay so today gna continuity between whatever the hell he's talking about in this chapter and modern schemes of social housing, and I think that's a general problem with the entire, frankly the entire uh project here is attempting to uh imagine a continuous chain of influence uh reaching from these uh pre uh modern i'm trying to think like it's a prehistorical not really they have they have uh they have writing, some of them do anyway, but uh, certainly not a lot of writing, but like these these uh things and you know modern notions of liberty and freedom, because he's he's trying to argue you, that uh rather than emerging from a process uh of you, modernization uh that uh ideas that we think of as modern uh ideas of liberty and justice and whatnot uh and freedom uh have their basis in these uh these early human settlements pre-columbian i guess that works too uh and as i said i don't know if that's really the case a lot of it end up hinging on his whole deal with you know uh the enlightenment being kindled by this interaction with uh indigenous cultures in uh north America and it does seem like he's kind of getting they're g to get getting to making it that argument that there's like this circular uh transmission whereby you uh icky hierarchical property relations erupt in uh eurasia. uh and then uh in in the new world in in the Americas uh these traditions of uh autonomy and and and and uh democracy have survived and that when they interact with one another uh it's when that's what causes uh European civilization to start to look inward and ask questions about what it really valuess and honestly even if it's true i don't know what you do with the fact that they just got fucking owned they got owned so fucking bad, all these uh traditions that they that they seek to point out at some point in history get just steamrolled permanently with no recovery, and uh, I just, I have to believe that that that has uh implications that uh, they just don't want to seem to really dwell on, because it challenges the idea that we're all really just like a mind. a mind uh set a phase shift in in mental you know framing away from just recreating these social uh organizational structures uh in you know the the wreckage of modernity that we're living in. so in this chapter grab grow uh after talking about early uh democratic or quasi democratic uh structures in urban areas in Eurasia uh move to mesoamerica and specifically into the Central American Yukintan peninsula area where uh where of course by uh the which are ruled by the uh 16th century 14th century 15th century by uh the Az techs which were then of course overthrown by the Spanish uh. but what grab grow want to point out is that before the uh hegemany of the of thech empire which is of course you a very brutal hierarchical social structure that enveloped you know slavery and mass fucking human sacrifice um there were other models of social uh relationships in uh that area and specific. typically the Azecs themselves uh were inspired in the construction of their uh their capital of tenaslan uh by a abandoned at that point the time they were moving through the the the uh the mexa valley there uh a city that the uh referred to as as the city of the gods because was had these monumental architectural structures but was totally abandoned called uh tiotwwan i believe that's it i'll go with tkun that'll work uh which was inhabited uh estimated from 100 bc to 600 ad so you got a good uh 700 year period where you have this area is settle in a urban space and it's a very weird uh uh sight, it it defies a lot of architectural of archeological expectations, because it has some as i said monumental architecture, it's got two huge pyramids, the pyramid of the sun, what the aspects called it, the pyramid of the moon, it's got a big uh open plaza with a that that fronted a a temple, a temple to the feathered serpent. uh mesoamericas, they love the feathered serpents, began those, and but it also has this weird layout of like apartment blocks basically all around it, with no uh signs of you, the sort of social uh stratification that you see in other uh early uh urban settlements and Grabgrrow point out that this seeming uh perplexity is sort of resolved if you look at the structure uh chronologically, the first thing to be built, the first thing that lasts think that be built anyway were these fucking uh giant structures, the the pyramids and and the the temple uh, but at this point in the history of the city uh the temple was uh raided, smashed, the... idols were destroyed, the they they did a Saddam Hussain pull down of the feathered serpent statues and after that you see the build this explosion in social housing basically where. they start building these relatively uh even sized uh apartment complexes like one floor apart story apartment complexes with like a hundreds of uh people uh in one what you'd call a neighborhood uh which were all decorated at different you know like uh what what grab refer to as psychodelic murals uh and you see in these areas that no signs of kingdom or ruledom uh this the images of people everyone's the same size, which is very rare, usually you'll see uh, one big guy to represent, the god and and then the king that that the god speaks through, here everybody's the same size, uh, essentially everyone is uh vibing, in the block, and grab girl paint this, this narrative where you had a classic uh human sacrifice based, because this is another thing that you see is evidence of human sacrifice, bodies being uh, you know, people being decapitated and their bodies being sort of uh arranged in uh patterns in the uh, in the foundation of buildings, you know, that kind of thing, and that stops the same time that the uh temple gets destroyed, and uh, doesn't happen anymore once uh this move towards social housing building has happened, and the picture that they that they tell is one where you have this this classical uh civilization of of brutal hierarchy and ritualized domination overthrown from within and literally the gods being pulled from their fucking uh from their platforms and and smashed uh and that in the wreckage of that the people democratically coming together uh to provide for each other. by building this structures of social housing, which while they were roughly the same size, we're not exactly the same size, and all of which were decorated in distinct ways and involved plenty of diversity, not just in styles, but also ethnicity, they say that there were quarters here for people from different tribes and different parts of uh Mexico and and the central and the and central America. And this is, this is where uh, I really felt from when I was a uh young anarchist, I felt a real like tingle as I remember reading about like you know other moments in time like this that you can kind of freeze and and and then texture and create a a a a a vision of like an alternative human potential and like there with this with this description they're filling in a lot of fucking gaps with what they want there to have been right because they they don't fucking know like it's a persuasive collection of evidence but that's because they're collecting it it might be very much less persuasive being collected by somebody else with different priors but anyway like you do have the reality of this very unusual social housing and you have the reality of the destruction of this temple complex so you have the every tool at your disposal to build this story of of a period, a little idol where where people were able to organize themselves, did not need gods or masters uh and and were able to provide for each other collectively, which is you know the dream of all of the entire uh left in any respect, you know, it's this is what. "this is if not like the teleology, like an end stage, it is the, it is the possibility, the potentiality that moves you forward, because if you can see it in your mind, if you can imagine it really happening, and especially if you can animate a period of history, even if it's a a moment uh, with that, with those values uh, a time when those values governed and did do the things that uh, reactionary social culture tells you, reactionary social assumptions tell you cannot happen, it it it keeps you focused, you know, it it it it sharpens and and directs your political action, because what else is to be sought but that in my view, like any of the schemes of of like natural hierarchy of the right all in obliteration, they have to, and all they end up doing is romanticizing that annihilation and obliteration that death drive and and and finding some apotheosis in it, but you know it's uh, it's sick. It's a sickness under death and and uh and it's not worth move, it's not worth trying to preserve uh or defend or or uh or validate, you know, but at the same time, it it strikes me of of how how much of yourself and how much of your uh, your desire of how you want things to be. inflex this because i remember reading about the Spanish civil war you know when i was like in my early 20s and reading about the July days when everyone knew in the city that the soldiers were going to come out of their barracks and they spontaneously organized to resist them and you had cab drivers uh welding uh sheep metal to the side of their cabs to make them into improvised armored cars and you had uh athletes who were in Barcelona for a uh socialist alternative to the Olympics Olympics in Munich, which many uh uh left-wing athletes had boycotted, just grabbing guns and going out into the the barricades and then when sure enough that next morning they they came out of their barracks they got fucking owned uh and then of course you know the the the uh collectivization of agriculture uh in the uh the Catalonian and Andalusian countryside, not not a staliness. nightmare, but a spontaneous expression uh of uh rural solidarity, you go to a village, the story of going to a village in in revolutionary Spain, there's a uh that is abolished money and abolished the value form and there's a there's a poster that says John Rockefeller could come in here to this city and he wouldn't be able to buy a single cup of coffee, you read about that and uh it gives you yes a sense of what could be and uh and a desire to see to to put some effort into making it happen. what's going on? what happened? what is why? can you not see me? can you not hear me? what's going on? it's normal, you can't do that to me people. okay. but at the same time as fun as it is to read and as important it is as it is just from a morale and spiritual perspective uh at the end of the day though what's it got to do with the price of beans you know like how does any of this uh deal how does any of this uh relate to the question of organizing towards power in the time that we live in a time all of these possibilities have been wiped out and a totalizing capitalism, a totalizing regime of technological alienation uh has defined human existence in a way that makes us as beings metaphysically distinct from the beings that are being described in this book and that's a question that i don't think that there's a lot of answers to that come you know in in in this literature. so then so grabrow talk a lot about this this city and it how it very well might have been this this little island of uh of mutualism in a sea of of b burdening uh like death cults and and and uh you know murder uh empires uh they also point out to the weird uh phenomenon of people from this city. uh becoming like stranger kings in areas to the south of the city uh suggesting that if you wanted to be a king if you wanted to to rule over others you essentially couldn't do it in the city and you had to go somewhere else you were uh you were like a adventurer a vagabond or or a merchant uh you very well might take uh the skills of governing and and asserting authority and asserting uh power that you learned in the democratic democratic uh tumolt of of the city and apply it to uh polities that expected hierarchy and expected and and in fact could not function without uh like monarchial domination. And then the the second half of the chapter is actually funny. in a way because uh the entire thing is a argument that the uh goddamn it i hate you got to say they're the toughest languages for me are the mezo-american ones the talakala the guys who helped cortes the tribe the tribe who when Cortes showed up with his uh vagaband bond of spaniards fought a number of times uh kept getting killed and then decided to ally with him to overthrow the ass stax i know you write it, that doesn't help me, i can read the writing, it doesn't tell me how to say it, i'm literally looking at the word here, this does not help having it written here, spelled the same way, it's not a spelling issue, it's a pronunciation issue, so the the whole gist of this, the second half of this chapter is uh grab grow making an argument and that's rather than uh being overawed by the power of the Spaniards or uh supernaturally subborned by a belief that they were gods or something that is like often assumed to be the case uh that that this tribe uh decided collectively and democratically to allie with uh Cortes and that we and and they point out that we have uh records you know from only a few generations like... uh describing the deliberations that went on among a people who were uh fundamentally governed by democratic uh means uh similar in in most respects, at least described to uh Europeans in a way that they recognized as like classic Athenian democracy uh and it is kind of funny that in this book that's supposed to be uh lotding the virtues of democratic deliberation uh that the one example we have so far of a decision that has come to democratically as opposed to a process that might bring about democratic decisions is the decision to ally with the Spaniords to essentially destroy uh pre-Colombian Mexican civil and Mexican civilization. That's pretty funny. Mikiko. Talaxiclacon all right, I'm going to avoid saying it, that's the way I'm going to get around this, like the whole thing is like, look, these guys, they didn't have a king, they weren't uh, they were, they were self-contained uh, uh, democratic agents who came together uh, in a in a spirit of equal. literal demons like monsters, pretty funny, and it does raise some questions, about like, I mean, at the end of the day, what is the benefit of this democrat? model is it the outcomes it comes to or is it that even if you make bad decisions that way uh there are decisions that are broadly understood to have been collectively made and therefore we can deal with the outcome of bad decisions because we're not riven against one ourselves the way we are, in our fake democracies where things keep getting worse and we have democratic uh systems allegedly in a democratic voice uh we never feel like we have anything to say about why things happen and so therefore we have to search for scape goats and places to sublimate our our impodence and uh just slowly and suddenly just termite like destroy the interior internal uh like cultural support structures for democracy. so this part of the chapter grab grow they describe how the this civilization uh carried out a like a public political uh deliberative process had um had a political class, people who you know uh stood for public office. uh, but were essentially uh hazed into it so that it would discourage the glory seeks and the and the primadonnas and the and the uh and frauds and the sophists from trying to claim power, because you'd had to really want to do it for its own sake to put up with the public ritual humiliation that politicians were required to go through, and honestly i got to say that is a good idea that should come back, there should be real like penitential trials that you should have to go through in order to make any attempt to uh claim governing authority on behalf of anyone else. And this is honestly why I really do think that elections in general are wildly overrated and I I I think that a functioning a truly functioning democratic polity that of course had abolished class rule, this is the important thing, would not have elections, because elections are how what you do to mask class rule, elections are ritual you perform to... validate class rule and to confirm its power over the land and its necessity, i think if that it was abolished, if there was not that constant conflict and tension within each person and between each person that is generated by class rule, you would not need fucking stupid ass elections, you'd have any any position that is technical would be done by someone who had technical expert. in it and any uh questions where you just basically need somebody to function as a uh as a decision point like an algorithm like i having you need somebody to say yes or no to a question sourtion baby picking names out of a fucking hat lottery. Somebody says, though imagine the selective pressures hazing our political cast would produce today, marjory taylor green would uh end up god queen, I don't think so, I uh, I guess it means what what you mean by hazing, I don't mean like people saying, I mean, apparently for uh the Talak Collins, they would like get politicians out in public and everyone would just insort them or insult them and scream at them and call them bad names and and basically uh read them for filth as the kids say, but that would not work now, that's not effective hazing now when when any attention is like fucking gammer radiation to the hulk, it has it would have to be unpleasant, it would have to be something that... a a pleasure seeker, a a glory hound would not want to experience, and the people, the thing about the thing that combines basically everybody in our political class now is that they are all doing it because they think it's a good time, they think it's fun and they think that it uh, it's validating, i mean i did you guys know about how like both mgt, i don't know about mgt, but i know that lawren bobert and candis owen and a bunch of other right-wing uh politicians and influencers uh all signed up for... like one of those scam mall uh modeling agency companies that like promises to get you work in modelling if you like pay him for headshots or something only for like actors they just want to be select they want to be famous they want to be actors but they don't have the talent of the looks to do it politics is a cheat code i can tell you i was able to be carve out a career in the quote entertainment industry broadly pursued because i didn't have to rely on my what communicabilities or my uh my intellectual bonafides, i was able to ride the wave of a interest in politics and articulate a political perspective, and that does so much of the work that would otherwise have to be done by the luck of your uh birth and then you know residually your talent, and so these people they all went through the back door, they went through the fucking uh, the sallyport cuuse why wouldn't you? and if you made politics actually unpleasant in some respect for these fucking people who are like the rest of us just labotomized by our uh most basely implanted uh instincts towards pleasure, they would flee, they would be horrified, i mean i don't know what it would have to be though, like i said insulting them wouldn't work, they love that, it's attention. Maybe that's it, they would have to go like a year without social media or uh like public appearance before they could apply for to run. for anything, can you imagine one of these people doing that? can you imagine one of these people not telling everybody what they fucking think every moment of every day for even a fucking a day, let alone a year? but I got to say though uh when he comes when it comes to this description of the talakala uh I have to I can't accept fully uh the grab grow argument about them because they're honestly too sketchy about the political economy of their civilization like they talk about how they have these uh you know uh democratic uh assemblies and stuff but as they point out the thing this reminded Europeans of was a thidian democracy which of course we know is only possible because of fucking slavery. now we know that these uh, the talakans were uh basically the only unsubjugated uh tribe in this area that was not under some sort of uh colonial relationship to uh the ASTX and in fact had to carry out like ritual warfare with the ASTX where they essentially had to sacrifice a number of their warriors every year to their dark rituals. and according to the aztex of course that's why they were free is because they were essentially uh like free range chickens like it was it was easier they were essentially part of the Ariste tech polity but it was uh much less of a hassle to just let them do their own thing and then whenever you need to go in and uh pluck out some warriors that you need because the thing it runs on human blood literally and of course you know that's that since these are you know people who define themselves in opposition to Astech culture very well might essue all elements of AzTech domination and I think this gets to an important uh thing that Grabgrow point out throughout this book is that these models of uh egalitarianism do not spring up out of nowhere they don't spring up from nature because they're very clear that they don't think there is a egalitarian state of nature and early early humanity, I would disagree. I mean, at a certain point it breaks down, but I do think you don't get tribal human society without enforced totalitarianism at some point, especially for the simple fact that uh, anything else could not be enforced really because of the ability of anybody to fucking move and leave, the inability to enforce any kind of like real authority over anybody else, but anyway. Their argument is that these models of egalitarianism emerge uh due to contact with hierarchical structures, societies emerging, deefying warriors and and creating hierarchies and and ritually reaffirming them through violence, and those who are disaffected by that life uh flee to the margins and then reconstruct a social order that is defines itself in opposition to all of those things, because as outsiders they see the uh, the repellent features that are laundered by the the cultural scheene, the rituals that sanctify it, or sometimes you have the opposite, like in the last chapter they talk about how early egalitarian urban centers in Mesopotamia had little warrior kingdoms sprow out in the... air periphery where you have the opposite thing happening, people repulsed by the efeatness and and uh and uh lack of martial vigor uh among settled uh people sitting in their you know giant warehouse uh temples writing in kineaform about how many you viles of uh of uh olive oil or fucking mud or whatever are going to go from one place to another and and not out there. you know red and tooth and claw, that other thing that is like part of the human animal, the need the need to uh, the need to seek and dominate and hunt, you know, that that needs to be synthesized into a uh, you know, a settled relationship to the world around you, but the form that that takes varies greatly on who you grew up around. and so their model for how galitarian structures are uh created and sustained. essentially requires this dialectical relationship with other power structures, other political economies. problem is now though, where we live, there is no alternative, there's no space anywhere else, there's no where outside yet, anyway, i think the one thing uh, i think by the end of this book, one thing that uh, i think we're going, i'm going to agree with with. grow here is that if we're going to build alternatives to this death spiraling capitalism uh it's going to be in geographic temporally fixed places outside of it and of course the bad news though is that the places that are going to be outside of it are only going to be outside of it because of a tactical retreat by capitalism. a uh a decision to cut off the limb like somebody with diabetes saw and off their feet and creating essentially post-apocalyptic uh landscapes and if anything is going to emerge contrary to this, it's going to be there, the problem is is that it's going to be all those places "the people in them, the people who will be in them, are people who have still uh, have been shaped by the conflicts and the uh, the categories uh of that global capitalism, and that's a challenge, and it has it's going to have to be resolved, and the thing that will resolve it, I think like at the..." level will will just be the yeah, the the will towards uh survival, because some people are going to come to the realization that's that cooperation in such a context is the only real way to secure survival. and that that alternative capitalism might never have anything to do with the destruction of capitalism, the overthrowing of capitalism, which would collapse from within through its own contradictions, until the entire globe is you know this massive... junkyard covered with people sifting through wreckage and trying to build things out of it, and then you know, a couple of uh people a couple of dead bodies with like uh ethernet cords jamd in the back of their uh heads because they thought they were downloading their consciousness into a fucking macbook and then like one factory left that just keeps perfecting. and releasing like synthetic versions of a spicy crispy chicken sandwich, because if you look at capitalism right now, the only place of where you see any innovation or any move towards the sort of competitive, you know uh winnowing towards perfection that we're supposed to get out of the uh out of the competitive capitalist economy is in treats and honestly specifically spicy chicken sandwiches, there's so many different ones. there's so many ones you can try, so it really does feel like this is a machine designed to make chicken sandwiches, not to, not to sustain people nutritionally, no, no, no, no, no, just to make the chicken sandwiches, so yeah, you a situation where the last people after are these uh, these muskite freaks who wald themselves off from humanity and tried to merge with their computer. before you know a dog came along and nodded the fucking plug out of the wall or whatever and then they just and then just the last expressions of the machine algorithm which has never been able to get beyond the profit motive and and the consumer society that it is premised on and he just shooting out spicy chicken sandwiches well the people left try to scratch some new out of it and singers that's to me that's That's enough hope to keep going, that's enough hope to obviate any argument about what's the point, because obviously if you're alive and keep living, you don't really believe that, you just have decided to ascribe to the most uh narrowly uh selfish idea of why, pile up pleasurable experiences, basically uh, of course you know that doesn't work and it destabilizes over time and you have to you know keep going more extreme in order to get the same experience uh but you know for most people if they're in the e in the in their you know adult early adulthood they're definitely they're not anywhere near that you know they're still very much able to uh scrape together enough. the dopamine to keep going, but you know, maybe there's more, and the to me the the fact that you know there always going to be people, they're always going to be trying to live, and uh, the the the grinding gears of material history are going to continually disrupt their relationship to their environment in such a way that settled delusions, settled uh, um mal practices, social malpractices cannot be sustained, and they will eventually uh be destroyed, without any revolution, like that's the thing, you don't have to, yeah, like there is no revolutionary context in the current moment, there's we don't have revolutionary subjects because the working class is no longer a subject of history as it was uh in the 20th century that means that someone else some other human formation is going to have to do that work of cobling all this shit together of of taking the technological capacity that we've accumulated which is the real uh of that building of forces of production is is technological capacity uh and wielding it collectively in dialogue with the natural world rather than in sort of a ritualized denial of its existence. okay, so that's that chapter. kind of a short one uh self-contained, the next chapter for next week, probably Friday, maybe Thursday, we'll see, uh, is, I think this is going to be a spicy and interesting one, uh, chapter 10, why the state has no origin, the humble beginnings of sovereignty, bureaucracy, and politics. Now we're gonna, I think finally get to get to grab grow, making an actual argument for, well, all right, if agriculture didn't cause uh, human. hierarchical social relations and property relations and urban life didn't do it, if both those things are compatible with democracy in a real sense, well where the fuck did it go? why did why did kings take over? so uh, this will be interesting, this because i think now we're finally going to get to a uh to a claim we can sink our teeth into dawn of everything by grab grow is the book for those asking, chapter 10. for next week, history has happening as the thing folks, and when his history is happening, all of your all of the rosary uh, worrying theoretical shit that you spend your time with kind of goes away, and uh, the question becomes vital. the problem is is that if you're relatively uh uh cop, like as we said, history is happening, but of course not evenly, not equally distributed, there the waves are are are buckling through the thing, but there they're being felt to different intensities in different places, so like we can feel the wave coming, but what do we do with ourselves, not in the abstract sense, because that can never lead to anything, that can always just be avoidance really of the question, because there's nothing we can do at that level, but we have to do something every... have our goddamn lives, and we're all in awareness that our relationship to our material world is not stable, and that that means we have to act, but the more we phrase this in, well what can I do politically to change the trajectory of this? I mean, that is really an abdication, and I'll admit completely that like I am, that's why I care i, I pay attention to politics, certainly, that's why my gays first cast itself to the political level when I was unsatisfied with my life and the trajectory of everyone's life as I could see it was, well who can I vote for or, what door can I knock on to to to make this uh change good? I think what we've found is that, well we can still act at that level, we can vote, we can knock on doors we can do that, we sure shit should not invote devote too much time intellectually or especially and even more importantly, emotionally to it, because the real questions are closer to... but the answers are close to home too, which means that talking about this level of of, praxis is very difficult in the social media realm, because as I said before, like you're constrained, you can't talk about political action that might be like meaningful, like forget if it's going to actually do anything, existentially meaningful in a way that voting and rooting for a party just can't be uh because it's not fucking legal and even the stuff that is political like what election like elections and who to support and what d on, the ones that matter are happening at the local level, at the very grassroots level, which means discussion of them in the social media realm will always be flattened to be about questions that are not applicable. generalized concepts and abstractions that have nothing to do with the questions that the people actually working on this specific campaign or what have it have you have to answer like uh the Amazon uh workers who uh organized their statin island facility like they what they pointed to when when describing like where they got their ideas for how to organize and and and where they got you know the uh where where they found their uh priorities, it was not online, it was fucking William Fosters organizing in the steel sector from the 1930s, because you got a bunch of people at a fucking uh a warehouse. essentially a modern day logistical factory who aren't allowed to go to the bathroom and can't pick when they work, if you're outside of that process, if you're a politically engaged person on the internet, how are you supposed to intervene in those questions? you're not having to go, not go to the bathroom, you're not having your work determined by others and that specific way, the only thing you can bring to the question are abstractions, are ideas of like abstract principles, like I see after the Amazon uh announcement, after the vote, people were like, like like, I can't wait for them to be anti-imperialist, you know, it's like, they very well might end up. where they're like doing solidarity strikes with you know people in other countries and stuff, they might have that happen, but it'll only be after they get fucking bathroom breaks for Christ, if you start with anti-imperialism, which is what a lot of people want to do, because they tell themselves, it's the most important thing, and in one sense it is, but in terms of an individual. american citizens ability to affect it the least important thing, which is why it's so fixated and fetishized by some, because they have no responsibility over it, because there's nothing they can do about it really. what's going to determine if they decide to do anti-imperialism is not going to be that a lot of enough of them read a post about it or saw a meme? It'll be because of other conditions occurring, it'll be because of material conditions changing and radicalization occurring in other sectors that they then would connect to, and I honestly see a situation where an Amazon union decides. "you know what, it's worth it, it's worth challenging uh the law and our bosses and risking what we have, and and and the gains we have made through collective bargaining, to make this international stand, I can see them making that decision, but it would be because of conditions that I cannot imagine or anticipate, conditions created by the rapid deterioration and trans transformation of material condition." and then people might apply some stuff they saw in uh in the ether to the question, but what's going to decide their answer is not going to be theoretical, it's going to be their recognized self-interest, whether or not they adhere it to other people in other lands and i can see that happening because the thing that prevents it from happening is faith that this order can provide something and that faith is being dissolved before our very fucking eyes what do you think uh everybody going uh absolute feral right uh means I mean yes it's not because we don't have politics it's nialistic but it speaks to a greater lack of any faith in any institution. that means that like the calculus that buys off labor traditionally in the United States uh also changes because like you like the the the context where business unionism overtook the American uh labor movement i mean obviously you have you know the the state jihad. of the second red scare that like actually put a social and uh professional cost to adhering to you know uh radicalism that didn't exist during the popular front uh era of world war one or world war 2 um but also the fact that "this American state, this you know capitalist behemith that yes had collapsed under its own contradictions uh in the 20s in the late 20s, early 30s, uh, had risen like a fucking Phoenix and provided a vision of utopian horizons, of course, for white workers, that goes without saying, but I guess you still got to say it, uh, and that that had a huge impact, but but that's. I would say that if you want to understand how why are political tribe or political uh class is so manifestly incompetent like at their jobs you know like they they're doing a bad job of their jobs in addition to you know being corrupt and doing because the state does have an interest in because from the long-term, the state is necessary for both, so it is in the best interest of the state to provide a certain degree of functionality, but it does not, and one of the big reasons is is that even the most sincere people in governance have not and cannot pros the real implications of declining living standards over the last 40 years, because they came into politics, all of them because they're all million years old in the and their understanding of political institutions where political authority is derived, all of the like propagandized ideological stuff, the the infrastructure of their mental world that define things like their self-interest, only gone up and up and up have still have the same relationship to those institutions that uh they did when they were younger, but that an entire generation is now coming a lot uh has now lived where those um those systems of legitimacy, patterns of legitimate, rituals of legitimation. have just been drained of everything, i mean they really did cut the copper out, the copper wiring out of the building, and they can't, they don't know that, and they can't know that, they cannot process it, and that's why the democrats are just watching as uh the republican party like coaleses into this uh counter like this, hostile internal regime that has fully assimilated the uh corruption and uh insufficiency and worthlessness of our institutions and and is fully willing to abolish them and it's not done anything even though it is absolutely in their power to uh minimize uh the worst of their you know designs on the institutions. because they think everybody sees these things, these structures, these rules, these symbols and sees them as legitimate, because they see them as legitimate, and the asymmetry in part comes from the fact that yes, most republicans and certainly political class republicans are rich just like democrats are, and have benefited from uh, you know, the uh imperial state. at its apogy and are still hanging around on on the fat of it even as it's declining, so they shouldn't be alienated materially from uh uh from you know the modern state, but they have been systematically alienated from it culturally, in a way liberals aren't, so they feel like they're losing, even though they've been winning their whole lot. because in order to stabilize itself, in order to integrate the new demographics of capitalism that needed to be brought into its system, the new consumers that needed to be appealed to, capitalism had to adopt a formal structure of tolerance, a culture of tolerance. which pleases of like pleases uh liberals to death, liberal elites, these like Armenians, these little uh, these little descendants of the of pilgrims, these little freaky calvinists who need to uh believe themselves to be good people to believe themselves to be worthy of election, uh, and and for what good people, means uh acting with charity in the world and acceptance and all these good values in the world. they they've been working you know overtime for this for the last 60 years and so they're happy to see it and they're cheering it on and that's why since they're not materially or culturally alienated from the culture and its superstructures they still... think that everybody around them has the same reverence for their institutions. meanwile through the looking glass, the reactionary right, ruling class, uh, the the old line puritans, the real the true calvinists, the ones who the ones who uh executed John felt or whatever the fuck his name was uh in 1860 or in 16 what 20 8 21. 21 right before the 12 year seas 12 year uh truce was ended in the Netherlands uh wh believe that you are elect because you are elect and that therefore hierarchies are naturally created therefore God inspired have been steadily alienated from the... cultural space for the last 40, 50 years, and so in alliance with people farther down on the totem pole than them who are both culturally and materially alienated from. the system, they will uh do their best to uh knock it down, all right, I think that's enough for today, next week, as I said, chapter 10, people are, apparently it's your people are doing a bit when you're asking what the name of the book is? dawn of everything, but why are they alienated? don't they have it all? everyone in a class society is subject to a fundamental alienation, like a a split within theself, because we relate to strangers through a veil of either, and and not either or in a combination. of both resentment and uh pity, guilt, basically, we are uneasy with our fellow man and can't be otherwise, because we look them in the eye and we know, we either know that they that we toil for their benefit or they toil for ours, and that has to be... that psychic break has to be soothed somehow, distracted from, rationalized, and our cultural rituals seek to rationalize them and affirm them and validate them, but it doesn't go away, and all of the travels we go through life happen in this context, and and the pain that we feel, the resentment, the alienation that is like processed otherwise, you know, through interpersonal lens, is also being reflected through this prism as well, and so even the people the very top of the totem pole are fundamentally miserable and alienated, they'll tell you themselves how unhappy they are, it's just a question of where they put that on happiness, liberal, rich liberal people are going to put put it at themselves, that's why they're all in therapy, that's why they're all fixated on on perfecting theself through acts of charity, yes and political virtue, but also self-cleansing and healing and and uh bucking yoga and and uh unguence, goop exists for these people, and so they try to purify themselves of the thing that that they feel, the that fundamental breach. conservatives, the right reactionalries, blame the other, the outsider and seek. punish them and subjugate them for this feeling, at least the ones who do politics, that's what their politics psychologically is is powered by, of course, what it's really powered by is their self-interest, which is of course all this stuff, but tied to the maintenance of their material position, which is what they seek first and foremost to uh to protect, and here's the thing, and here's the reason that so here's the situation, you've got these two... halves of a ruling class right, they're both operating out of these completely distinct reality worlds, so there this is a clash of ideas right, and and when we see politics it is this idealist clash, but what is happening while they're legislating and and and uh speculate, well people are legislating and debating and uh and organizing along these uh these camps, they're also seeing... to their material interests, and while the cultural stuff they do is in conflict, and in fact that conflict defines politics, the stuff they do for their material interests aligns in the same direction, at a deep enough level, like there's sectoral conflict, once again, whoever you know has more money, more influence, maybe some better lobbists win there, but at the baseline level, it's all aligned, and there's nothing there to conflict with it, there's nothing there to challenge it, working class used to challenge it, that's why the politics of the 20th century were the way they were, but it's no longer there to provide a challenge, and so it goes unchallenged, and it as conditions deteriorate and it cannot adapt to those conditions to secure the uh legitimacy of the systems, they just get undermined and destroyed, and the people in the political realm fight even harder to try to win, to try to resist the... and that is why I really do believe that the challenge to this thing will come outside of it, will become, will come in the realms that have been surrendered to nature by capitalism, and that only in that space where... uh even the technological structures of compulsion are no longer running, can people start building something different, something that maybe maybe brings together all of the necessary progressive developments, both technologically and culturally and ideologically, and conceptually, and and brings them together, and the thing that's going to bind it together is going to be some new spiritual conception, i am very convinced of that. what it will be? i don't know, zensunism, who knows? a spiritual answer is going to be a cope for material realities, well yes, but like if material realities get bad enough that you can't depend on you know the supply chain to to give you your nutrient slurry when you have to live on your own then coping becomes surviving coping becomes organizing coping becomes living collectively to literally cope with your conditions i e survive them and perhaps thrive in them. It'll be cool, whatever it is, and it'll probably rule the galaxy in like a 10,00 years, 20,0 years, hell, maybe 100,0 years, don't get don't, you don't want to get ahead of yourself, hell, sometimes I think it's going to be based in Juche, buse like what polity in the world is best suited to deal with like? really really bad climate change, like say climate change is as bad as your worst predictions of it, and obviously not like the thing where we turn into Venus, because but like where it like fundamentally disrupts all of our uh, it ends the world as we know it basically, and everything gets result, gets brought down to uh barbarism, what will be the most resilient polity, how is it not North Korea? I mean, where it is, it's probably not going to get the worst of climate change. right, pretty far north, it's not, cuba, god bless Cuba, but they're cooked, they're fucked uh, north korea up there, the little armpit snows and they've got this, you know, uh, this hermit kingdom up there, that under like a in a real crisis, I mean hell, it's not like those people have a lot of uh, you know, addictions to treats, to that could like alienate them from everything as uh, as... real uh hunger sets in, they've survived horrifying famins before, including in the early 90s uh, maybe those emerge is like the one of the few uh areas of of uh human organization to make to sustain itself to emerge from the like equilibrium that eventually is established and then they hook up with other people who have survived individually and those other people are able to uh, interact with the North Koreans and and their ideas are like changed by relationship and contact with these new people, but like their shared interest in cooperating to survive works through the system and basically does the job of resolving political conflicts. and so then you know the the the human uh, the synthesized human civilization that does conquer the biome in the sense of uh creating a stable technologically mediated equilibrium with it, then conquers the stars. I don't know, sometimes I think my money is on uh cephalopods, like it's not even human beings. It's intelligent uh, it's intelligent octopy, but even if it's even if it's octopuses, it's still us, okay, maybe crows, that would also be cool. All right, next week with chapter 10. Bye-bye.
